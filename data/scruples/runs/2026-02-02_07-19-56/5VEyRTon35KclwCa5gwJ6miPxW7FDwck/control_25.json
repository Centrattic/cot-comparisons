In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a colleague who had a crush on them. The situation involves the girl professing her love twice, once in the first week and again during a team-building hike, both times leading to emotional outbursts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a professional setting, working in IT. They helped onboard a new, younger colleague who was fresh out of college. The age difference is significant, which adds another layer. The author responded to the girl's declarations by stating it was infatuation and then became more distant to maintain professionalism. The girl then had more crying episodes, especially during the hike when the author publicly rejected her again.\n\nThe key points here are professional boundaries and emotional responsibility. The author's actions were to keep things professional, which is generally expected in the workplace. However, the girl's emotional reactions were intense and public. The author chose not to console her, even during the ride home where she was crying and screaming. They increased the radio volume and stayed silent, which could be seen as emotionally neglectful.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't responsible for the girl's feelings and shouldn't have to enter a relationship they're not interested in. It's important to maintain professional boundaries, especially with a junior colleague. On the other hand, even within professional limits, showing some basic empathy and consoling someone who's emotionally distressed might be expected, even if you're not romantically interested. The author's response was completely silent and dismissive, which might come across as harsh.\n\nThe fact that the girl moved on to someone else quickly suggests that the rejection wasn't permanent for her, but the situation during the outbursts still needs to be addressed. The author's choice to not apologize or offer any comfort could be seen as lacking in compassion, even if they were trying to stay professional. There might be a balance between maintaining boundaries and showing kindness in difficult moments.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention to keep things professional is valid, their method of handling the emotional situation might be considered inconsiderate. Not consoling someone who is clearly upset, even if they're being unprofessional themselves, could be seen as the wrong approach. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
