In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them. The situation involves a new coworker who immediately professed love, cried, and the author responded by being distant and not offering comfort. Then, when the girl made another public confession, the author shut her down, drove her home, and kept silent while she cried, even turning up the radio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette and boundaries. The author helped the girl during onboarding, which is standard, but the girl's reaction was intense. When someone starts crying at work, it's usually inappropriate to be indifferent. The author changed their behavior to be more professional, but that led to more crying episodes. Then, during the team-building hike, the girl confessed again. The author's response was to shut her down publicly, which might have been harsh, but the follow-up where they drove her home and didn't console her is the main issue here.\n\nIn a professional setting, even if there's a crush, it's expected to handle situations with empathy. The girl was clearly emotional and in distress. The author's silence and increasing the radio volume could be seen as dismissive and uncaring. Even if the author felt the girl's actions were unprofessional, responding without empathy might have been wrong. The author could have set boundaries but also shown some level of concern, especially since they were in a position to de-escalate the situation. The fact that the girl moved on quickly might not mitigate the author's responsibility to handle the situation more compassionately. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But some might argue that the author was right to keep it professional. However, the lack of any attempt to console her seems excessive. So I think the answer is A.\n"
