In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves the coworker confessing her feelings twice, the first time crying and the second time breaking down during a team-building hike.\n\nFirst, the author helped the new employee, which is good. But when the girl declared her love, the author dismissed it as infatuation. The girl then cried, and the author changed their behavior to be more professional. However, when the girl tried to confess again publicly, the author shut her down, leading to another emotional episode. The author then drove her home, kept silent, and even turned up the radio to avoid comforting her.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the girl is new, fresh out of college, and there's an age difference. The author might be in a position of influence over her. The key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate and compassionate. By not consoling her and instead isolating her emotionally during the ride, the author might have exacerbated her distress. Even if the author wasn't interested, a professional approach would involve handling the situation with empathy. Dismissing her feelings without providing any emotional support could be seen as harsh, especially in a workplace setting. The fact that the author continued to be cold afterward without apology might be unkind. \n\nHowever, the author did maintain professionalism in work interactions. The question is about whether they were an asshole for not consoling her. While they didn't cross into romantic interest, the way they handled the emotional situation could be questioned. The answer might hinge on balancing professional boundaries with empathy. Since the author didn't act unprofessionally in their work interactions but failed to show compassion during the emotional episodes, it's a nuanced situation. But in terms of being an asshole, the lack of consoling might be seen as inconsiderate, hence possibly answer A.\n"
