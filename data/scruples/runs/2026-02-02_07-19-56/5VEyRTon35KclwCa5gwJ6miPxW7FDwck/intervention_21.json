In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them and got upset when rejected. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a professional setting, helped a new employee (who's much younger and fresh out of college), and the coworker started showing romantic interest. The author rejected her, leading to emotional outbursts. Then, during a team-building event, the coworker tried to profess her feelings again publicly, and the author shut her down, leading to another breakdown. The author didn't comfort her during the ride home, instead turning up the radio to avoid interaction.\n\nNow, considering professional boundaries. In a workplace, especially with a significant age difference, it's important to maintain clear boundaries. The author initially tried to be friendly, which is normal, but when the coworker expressed romantic feelings, the author corrected her by saying it's infatuation. That part might be okay, but the way they handled her emotional reactions is questionable.\n\nWhen the coworker started crying at work after the first rejection, the author changed their behavior to be professional but didn't provide any support. Then, after the public confession and breakdown, the author didn't console her, used the radio to drown out her emotions, and dropped her off without saying anything. This seems harsh, especially considering the coworker was young and new to the job. \n\nEven if the author felt it's not their responsibility to comfort her, completely ignoring her emotional state could be seen as cruel or neglectful. In a professional setting, you should handle such situations with empathy to avoid creating a hostile work environment. The fact that the coworker moved on quickly might not absolve the author of responsibility. They could have handled it more sensitively to prevent public embarrassment and emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author's actions during the ride home\u2014increasing the radio volume to avoid the conversation\u2014show a lack of empathy. A more appropriate response would be to listen, set boundaries, but show compassion. The author's silence and indifference might have contributed to the coworker's distress. \n\nSo, while the author isn't at fault for rejecting the advances, the way they handled the emotional fallout could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
