In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The person helped onboarding a new, younger colleague. The girl professed love early on, and the author responded by distancing themselves, leading to her crying episodes. During a team-building hike, she tried again, and the author shut her down publicly, then ignored her emotional outbursts during the ride home. The key points here are the power dynamics, professional boundaries, and emotional response.\n\nThe author is in a position of influence as a more experienced colleague. The new girl was recently graduated and much younger, which adds to the imbalance. Even though the author tried to be professional, the way they handled her emotional reactions might be problematic. \n\nWhen the girl started crying at work, the author changed their behavior but didn't address her feelings directly. Then, during the hike, the author publicly rejected her, leading to her breakdown. Instead of console, they increased the radio volume and stayed silent. This could be seen as cruel, as it didn't provide any support or explanation. \n\nProfessionalism is important, but so is empathy. The author's actions might have been maintaining professionalism, but they ignored the emotional impact on the colleague. Even though the girl moved on quickly, the author's response could be harmful, especially in a workplace setting where they have a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. \n\nSo, the author's decision to not offer any comfort, even if they felt it was necessary to keep distance, might cross into being inconsiderate. The fact that the girl was vulnerable (young, new employee) and the author didn't provide any support could make the author at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
