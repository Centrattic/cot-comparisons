In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on him. \n\nFirst, the situation is in a workplace, which is a professional setting. The writer helped a new colleague who was a recent college graduate. There's a significant age difference. The girl declared her love early on, and the writer rejected her, explaining it was infatuation. She reacted emotionally, and he tried to maintain professional distance, leading to more crying episodes.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she publicly professed her love again. The writer shut her down publicly, which caused her to have a breakdown. He took her home, and during the ride, she continued to cry and scream. He didn't console her, increased the radio volume instead, and left without apologizing. The girl eventually moved on to someone else.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the writer was an asshole for not comforting her. The user thinks he is in the wrong. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. The writer tried to stay professional, which is important. However, when someone is in emotional distress, even if it's due to unrequited feelings, the appropriate response is usually to offer some level of empathy or support, unless it's inappropriate. The writer, however, didn't respond with any comfort. He increased the radio volume to avoid engagement, which seems callous.\n\nPublicly rejecting someone can be harsh, but the follow-up action of not providing any comfort in a private setting where she's clearly upset might be worse. Even if the feelings are unrequited, it's considerate to acknowledge their emotions, even if you don't reciprocate. The fact that he stayed silent and used the radio as a barrier suggests a lack of empathy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was a new employee and younger adds to the power dynamic. The writer might be in a position of influence, so his actions could impact her work environment. Not consoling her could contribute to a hostile work environment, even if it's not intentional.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer did try to maintain professionalism. He didn't engage in a relationship, which is the right call in a workplace setting. But the way he handled the emotional situation could be seen as insensitive. The key here is whether it's acceptable to ignore someone's emotional distress in a private setting, even if the feelings are unrequited.\n\nIn many cases, people expect some level of empathy, especially when someone is clearly upset. The writer's silence and avoidance might be perceived as cruel rather than professional. So, while the initial rejection was appropriate, the lack of any comfort during her breakdown could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
