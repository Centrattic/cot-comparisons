In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The question is about not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them and reacted emotionally after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person helped the new employee during onboarding, which is normal. The girl had a crush and declared her feelings, which the author dismissed as infatuation. The girl reacted with tears, and the author adjusted their behavior to be more professional. Later, during a team-building event, she confessed again publicly, leading to another emotional outburst. The author took her home but didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume when she cried.\n\nNow, the key points: The author's actions after the emotional episodes. In the workplace, maintaining professionalism is crucial, especially when dealing with emotional situations. However, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress, even if they've been rejected, might be considered harsh. While the author didn't encourage the relationship and tried to be professional, not offering any support when the person is clearly upset could be seen as unkind. \n\nThe author did drop her off, which shows some level of responsibility, but staying silent and increasing the radio volume instead of providing comfort is problematic. Even if the author didn't want to engage in a relationship, showing empathy during an emotional crisis is expected in most social contexts. The fact that the girl later moved on doesn't mitigate the author's responsibility to act with compassion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was within their rights to reject the advances and maintain professional boundaries. But the way they handled the aftermath\u2014especially during the ride home\u2014could be seen as neglecting the person's emotional needs. The key is whether the author was an asshole by not consoling her. Since the author's actions contributed to her distress, not offering any consolation might make them at least partially responsible.\n\nSo, considering both the professional boundaries and the need for empathy, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not consoling her, even if the initial rejection was justified. The lack of empathy during her emotional breakdown is the main issue here.\n"
