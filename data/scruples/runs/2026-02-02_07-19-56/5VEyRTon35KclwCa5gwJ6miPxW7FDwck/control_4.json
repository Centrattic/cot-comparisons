In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a new employee with a crush on them, and the author's response to that crush.\n\nFirst, the author helped the new girl during onboarding, being friendly as usual. The girl declared her love early on, and the author told her it was infatuation. She cried, so the author distanced themselves professionally. Then, during a team-building event, the girl confessed again publicly, leading to more crying. The author drove her home, but didn't console her, even turning up the radio to ignore her emotional outbursts.\n\nNow, considering workplace dynamics, maintaining professionalism is key. The author tried to be professional from the start. However, when the girl became emotional, especially during the ride home, the author's response was to remain silent and increase the radio volume. That might be seen as not showing empathy, even if they were trying to avoid personal interaction.\n\nBut, the author didn't engage in the emotional display and kept things professional. The girl moved on quickly, so maybe the long-term impact wasn't bad. However, in a professional setting, even if someone is being unprofessional (like the girl public confessing), a mature response would be to handle it with some compassion without encouraging the relationship. Not consoling could be seen as harsh, but the author wasn't actively harmful beyond not providing comfort. \n\nWorkplace relationships can get tricky, especially when there's a significant age difference. The author might be right to avoid a potential conflict of interest by not encouraging the crush. But the way they handled the emotional situation (ignoring her crying) could be seen as lacking empathy, even if they were trying to stay professional. \n\nSo, the line between professionalism and empathy is thin here. The author's actions might be considered harsh, thus making them in the wrong (A), but others might argue they were just keeping things professional (B). Considering the scenario, the author's response during the ride might cross into unprofessional territory by not showing basic human kindness, even if the initial distancing was appropriate. So the answer leans towards A.\n"
