In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works in IT and tried to stay professional. A new, younger coworker had a crush and expressed her feelings twice: once during onboarding and again during a team-building hike. The author rejected her, which led to her crying episodes. The key here is whether the author was wrong in not consoling her after the second incident.\n\nThe author's actions after the second confession were to drop her off in silence, turning up the radio to avoid the emotional outburst. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional. The coworker eventually moved on.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: \n\n1. The author was professional in their role but had to handle a colleague's emotional situation. \n2. The colleague's actions were unexpected and possibly overwhelming for her, being new and young.\n3. The author's response was to avoid engaging emotionally, which might be seen as harsh but also as maintaining professionalism.\n\nIn workplace scenarios, maintaining boundaries is important. However, when a colleague is emotionally distressed, especially after being rejected, there's a balance between professionalism and empathy. The author didn't console her, which could be seen as neglecting her emotional state. But the author might argue that they were trying to keep things professional and not escalate the situation.\n\nThe line between professional distance and being empathetic is thin here. While it's important not to encourage a relationship, especially with a junior colleague, responding with silence and ignoring her emotional state could be seen as uncaring. However, the author didn't engage in any harmful behavior beyond setting boundaries. \n\nThe coworker's reaction was intense, and the author's silence might have been a way to avoid further confrontation. But in such cases, some level of acknowledgment or comfort, even if rejecting the feelings, might be expected. The fact that the author increased the radio volume to drown out her crying could be seen as dismissive.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be seen as not in the wrong because they maintained professionalism and didn't encourage the relationship. However, there's a case for them being in the wrong for not at least offering some level of comfort, even while rejecting the feelings. The key is whether a professional person would console someone in distress, even if they can't reciprocate feelings.\n\nIn many workplaces, there's an expectation to treat colleagues with respect and dignity. Even when rejecting someone's romantic advances, it's important to do so in a way that doesn't humiliate or ignore their emotional state. The author's approach could be seen as lacking empathy, which might make them the asshole. On the other hand, if they tried to keep things as neutral as possible without overstepping, it's debatable.\n\nGiven that the author didn't apologize and left the situation without any comfort, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of empathy. But if maintaining professional boundaries without engaging in a personal way is acceptable, then B (not in the wrong) could be the answer. The community's standards in AITA often favor empathy and kindness, even when being professional, so the answer might be A. But I need to be precise here.\n"
