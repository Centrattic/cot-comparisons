In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of theAITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author helped a new, younger coworker during onboarding. The coworker expressed love early on, and the author dismissed it as infatuation. This led to the coworker crying. The author then kept their interactions strictly professional, which caused more emotional episodes. During a team-building hike, the coworker publicly professed her feelings again, leading to a public breakdown. The author drove her home, didn't console her, and even turned up the radio to drown out her crying. They didn't apologize and kept things professional afterward.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. In a workplace, maintaining professionalism is important. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, especially due to your actions, there's a moral consideration about how to respond. The author was clear in their rejection, which is their right. But when someone is clearly upset and in emotional distress, even if it's due to unrequited feelings, there's a social expectation to show some empathy or offer comfort, even if you don't reciprocate feelings.\n\nThe author's response of silence and increasing the radio volume could be seen as callous. While they might not be obligated to offer emotional support, deliberately ignoring someone's distress could cross a line. Workplace relationships require balancing professionalism with basic human decency. The coworker's actions were inappropriate (public declarations of love), but the author's response might have been unnecessarily harsh, especially since the coworker was a new employee and possibly more vulnerable.\n\nAlso, the fact that the coworker moved on quickly suggests she wasn't deeply harmed, but that doesn't absolve the author of potential wrongdoing. The key point is whether the author had a duty to console her. In a professional setting, while you don't have to be friends, showing minimal empathy is usually expected. The author's actions might be seen as lacking that, making them at least partially at fault for not consoling her, even if her initial rejection was justified.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions in the car were harsh and could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
