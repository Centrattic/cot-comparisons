In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not consoling a co-worker who had a crush on them. The situation involves the writer helping a new employee, who then confesses her feelings. The writer responds by distancing themselves professionally, leading to emotional outbursts from the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider professional boundaries. The writer worked in IT and tried to maintain professionalism. When the new employee showed a crush, the writer didn't reciprocate and instead kept communication minimal. This seems reasonable, as mixing work and personal relationships can complicate things. The writer's actions were to prevent any issues, which is standard practice.\n\nThen there's the part where the coworker starts crying and the writer doesn't console her. The user might think that showing empathy is necessary, but the writer's silence could be seen as a way to avoid encouraging the feelings further. However, in a professional setting, it's important to handle such situations with care. Even if the writer isn't interested, responding with some form of empathy or guidance could have been better to prevent the coworker from feeling humiliated or rejected in a public setting.\n\nDuring the team-building hike, the coworker professes her feelings again in public. The writer shuts her down, leading to more crying. The writer then takes a ride with her, increases the radio volume instead of addressing her emotions. This part is tricky. While the writer might want to avoid any personal interaction, not consoling someone who's clearly upset could be seen as insensitive. Even if the writer isn't interested in a relationship, a simple acknowledgment of her feelings, like saying they don't feel the same and encouraging her to focus on work, might have been more considerate.\n\nThe coworker eventually moves on, so maybe the writer's approach worked in the long run. However, the immediate reaction of ignoring her emotional distress could be seen as harsh. Professionalism doesn't mean being completely indifferent; it's about balancing respect and maintaining boundaries. The writer's actions might be justified in keeping work relations professional, but the lack of empathy in a clearly emotional situation could be where they went wrong.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons: maintaining professionalism is good, but not addressing the coworker's emotional state during the ride might be inconsiderate. The key is whether the writer's actions crossed the line from professional to inconsiderate. Since the coworker was in a vulnerable state and the writer chose to ignore her emotional outbursts, this could be seen as the writer being in the wrong. However, others might argue that it's not their responsibility to console someone who's acting unprofessionally. The answer hinges on the balance between professional boundaries and empathy.\n"
