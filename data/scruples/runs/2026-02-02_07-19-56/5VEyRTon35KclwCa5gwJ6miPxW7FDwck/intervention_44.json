In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them. The situation is in a workplace, which is important because workplace relationships can be tricky.\n\nFirst, the girl starts with a crush and declares her feelings multiple times. The author responds by saying it's infatuation and not real love. That part seems reasonable. But when she starts crying, the author reduces their interaction to just professional. That's probably necessary to maintain boundaries, especially since there's an age gap and she's new. But then, when she professes her love again in public during a team-building event, the author shuts her down. Then, during the ride home, the girl is upset and the author doesn't console her, turns up the radio, and stays silent. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about empathy and professional conduct. Even if the author is not the one who initiated the feelings, once someone is emotionally distressed, there's a social expectation to at least acknowledge their feelings, even if you can't reciprocate. The author's response of ignoring the girl's emotional state and using the radio to drown out her crying could be seen as cruel or lacking in empathy. While maintaining professional boundaries is important, completely cutting off communication and showing no concern might cross the line into being an asshole. The fact that the girl later moved on doesn't mitigate the author's responsibility to handle the situation with care. So, even though the author isn't at fault for the girl's feelings, their response could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not consoling her during a vulnerable moment.\n"
