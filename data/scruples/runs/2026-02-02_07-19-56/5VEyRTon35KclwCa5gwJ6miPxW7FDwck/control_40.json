In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new coworker who had a crush on them.\n\nFirst, the author helped onboarding the new employee, which is part of their job. The girl confessed her feelings early on, and the author responded that it was just infatuation. The girl cried, so the author became more professional. Then, during a team-building hike, she professed her love again in public. The author shut her down, and during the ride home, the girl was upset but the author didn't console her, instead turning up the radio.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are boundaries in the workplace and how to handle a colleague's emotional distress. The author tried to keep things professional after the initial confession, which is appropriate. However, when the girl was clearly upset during the ride home, the author didn't console her, which might be seen as insensitive.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. While it's okay to set professional boundaries, there's an expectation to treat colleagues with kindness and respect. The girl was in distress, and even if the author didn't want to engage in a romantic relationship, responding with empathy could be necessary. Letting her cry and scream without any response, and even increasing the radio volume, might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than addressing her emotional state. \n\nThe author's actions could be viewed as dismissive. While they didn't apologize and maintained professionalism, their response during the emotional moment might lack compassion. The girl moved on quickly, but that doesn't excuse the author's lack of empathy in the situation. So, even though maintaining professional boundaries is important, the way they handled the emotional aspect could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
