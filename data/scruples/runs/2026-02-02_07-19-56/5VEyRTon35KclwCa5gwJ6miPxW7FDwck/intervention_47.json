In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a workplace scenario where the author helped a new female colleague, which led to her developing feelings for him. He rejected her romantic advances, and she had emotional reactions. The key points to consider are the author's actions and whether they were appropriate, especially in a professional setting.\n\nFirst, the author helped a new employee, which is normal. However, when the new employee expressed her feelings, he dismissed it as \"infatuation\" and told her she doesn't really love him. That's a firm rejection, but maybe not inherently wrong. The problem arises in how he handled her subsequent emotional responses. \n\nWhen she started crying at work, he changed his behavior to be more professional and minimized communication. This caused her to have more crying episodes. Then, during a team-building hike, she publicly professes her love again, and he shuts her down, leading to a public breakdown. He then takes her home, where she continues to cry and scream, and he responds by turning up the radio and remaining silent. \n\nThe author's approach seems to be avoiding any emotional support. Even though he might be trying to maintain professionalism, completely ignoring her emotional state during a vulnerable moment could be seen as cruel. In a professional setting, it's expected to handle such situations with some level of empathy, even if you can't or don't want to reciprocate feelings. \n\nThe fact that he didn't apologize and that she later moved on to someone else doesn't absolve him of his actions. The way he handled her emotional distress could have been more compassionate. While he's not responsible for her feelings, he is responsible for how he responds to them, especially in a workplace environment where maintaining a respectful and supportive atmosphere is important.\n\nSo, even though he's being professional by not engaging in a romantic relationship, his lack of empathy in the situation might make him at least partially at fault. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't provide the necessary emotional support when she was clearly upset, which could be considered inconsiderate.\n"
