In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves the coworker confessing her feelings multiple times, crying in the office, and then again during a team-building hike. The author responds by becoming distant, shutting her down, and during the ride home, they don't console her, even increasing the radio volume when she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. The author was professional, but the coworker's actions crossed into personal territory. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, especially in a public setting like a team-building event, there's an expectation of some level of empathy. The author's silence and lack of comfort could be seen as harsh, even if they didn't reciprocate feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the public declarations, the crying episodes, and the author's response during the ride. While the author isn't obligated to engage in a relationship, ignoring someone's visible distress without any attempt to console them might cross into being inconsiderate. The age difference and the coworker's inexperience might also play a role in how the situation is perceived.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to maintain professionalism and kept communication minimal after the initial rejection. They didn't escalate the situation further once the coworker moved on. However, the lack of empathy during the emotional breakdown could be seen as a failure to maintain a respectful workplace environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't to blame for the coworker's feelings, their response during her emotional crisis might be considered inconsiderate. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
