In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works in an IT company and a new girl starts. The author helps her onboard, being friendly as usual. The girl, who's fresh out of college and there's an age gap, tells the author she loves him. The author says it's infatuation and not real love. The girl cries, and the author then becomes more professional and distant, which leads to more crying.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, the girl professes her love again in public. The author shuts her down, leading to a breakdown. The author drives her home, during which she cries and screams, and the author stays silent, even turning up the radio. The author never apologizes and keeps things professional after that. The P.S. says she moved on quickly.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The girl had a crush, the author was friendly initially. The author's response was to tell her it's infatuation and then become distant. When the girl tried again in public, the author shut her down harshly, and during the ride, didn't console her. The author's actions caused emotional distress, and there's no apology.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. The author tried to remain professional, which is good, but when someone is clearly upset, especially after your actions, there's an expectation to handle it with some empathy. The girl was crying in the workplace and later on a team-building event. The author's response of silence and increasing the radio volume seems dismissive and lacks empathy. Even if the author didn't want to engage in a relationship, responding with some level of compassion might be necessary, especially when someone is in distress. The fact that the author never apologized could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author did try to keep things professional after the initial incident. Maybe they felt uncomfortable and were trying to avoid further issues. But when someone is actively hurting emotionally because of your actions, not offering any comfort could be seen as uncaring. The author's approach might have been to avoid any encouragement, but the method used was harsh. The girl was vulnerable, and the author's behavior during the ride home could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl continued to pursue the author despite being rejected, which might have been her own choice. The author might not be responsible for her emotional reactions beyond a certain point. However, when someone is clearly upset, especially in a professional setting, the author's responsibility might extend to not exacerbating the situation. The public rejection and then the silent ride home could be seen as contributing to her distress without any attempt to mitigate it, which is problematic.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's behavior might be seen as lacking empathy and contributing to the girl's emotional turmoil without offering support. That would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But there's also the argument that the girl's actions were her own choice, and the author was just trying to maintain boundaries. However, the way the author handled the aftermath, especially the ride home, seems to cross into inconsiderate behavior. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
