In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on him. The situation is at work, and the author kept things professional but didn't comfort her after she cried. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the girl started a job and had a crush. The author was friendly during onboarding but didn't reciprocate her feelings. When she told him she loved him, he told her it was infatuation. She cried, and he became more distant. Then, during a team-building hike, she tried again, he shut her down, and she had another emotional episode. He didn't console her, turned up the radio, and just dropped her off. He didn't apologize and kept work professional.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was wrong. Well, in a workplace, maintaining professionalism is key. But when someone is emotionally distressed, especially after you've rejected their advances, there's a line between professionalism and being cruel. The author's actions might be seen as harsh. Even if you don't want to engage romantically, showing empathy is important. Letting someone cry and scream without any comfort could be unkind. However, he did try to keep things professional and maybe felt it was the best approach. But pushing away and ignoring someone's emotions might not be the right way, even if it's not a romantic relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl moved on quickly, so maybe he didn't cause lasting harm. But the immediate response of not consoling her could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's silence and turning up the radio might be seen as avoiding responsibility. So, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't handle it with empathy, even if he was trying to stay professional. But it's a tricky situation because workplace relationships need boundaries. However, there's a difference between being professional and being an asshole. If he could have been kinder while still setting boundaries, then he might be wrong for not doing that. So I think the answer leans towards A.\n"
