In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a colleague with a crush who gets upset when he rejects her.\n\nFirst, the guy helped her onboarding and was friendly, which is normal. She declared her love early on, and he told her it was infatuation. She cried, and he adjusted his behavior to be more professional. That seems reasonable because you can't be in a romantic relationship with a coworker if you're in a position to influence their work.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again publicly. He shuts her down, which she reacts to with a fit. He takes her home, and during the ride, she's crying and screaming. He doesn't console her, turns up the radio, and drops her off. \n\nThe key points here: He's maintaining professionalism, but his response during the car ride is cold. Is it wrong not to console someone who's clearly upset, even if they're not your partner? He didn't apologize, but he also says she moved on quickly. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. He's in a position of authority or at least responsibility, especially since she's new. Rejecting her clearly is important to prevent harassment claims. But the way he handled the emotional aftermath might be harsh. \n\nHe could have been more empathetic during the car ride. Even if he didn't want to console her, acknowledging her feelings might have been better. His silence and turning up the radio could be seen as dismissive. \n\nHowever, he's maintaining professional boundaries, which is necessary. The outcome is that she moved on, so maybe the rejection was handled correctly in terms of keeping the workplace environment healthy. \n\nSo, is he an asshole? It's a balance between professionalism and empathy. The actions taken are extreme but perhaps necessary to avoid any romantic entanglements. However, the lack of empathy during her emotional breakdown could be seen as wrong. But in the context of a workplace scenario, maybe it's justified. \n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether his actions crossed into being unkind without a professional reason. Since he's avoiding a relationship, but his response was harsh. Maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
