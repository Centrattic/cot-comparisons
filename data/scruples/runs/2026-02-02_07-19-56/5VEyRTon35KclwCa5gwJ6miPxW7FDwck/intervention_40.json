In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them at work. The story involves the author rejecting the girl's advances, which led to emotional outbursts, and the author not providing any comfort during their ride home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is new, just out of college, and there's an age difference. The author helped her onboard, which could have led to her developing feelings. The author rejected her twice, which caused her to cry. The key issue here is whether the author's lack of consolation makes them an asshole.\n\nIn a professional setting, it's important to maintain boundaries. The author did that by keeping communication professional. However, when the girl became emotionally distressed, especially in a one-on-one situation during a ride home, the author didn't offer any comfort. Instead, they increased the radio volume and stayed silent. This could be seen as callous, even if they didn't initiate the emotional response. \n\nThe girl's actions were unprofessional in confessing publicly, but the author's response wasn't supportive. While the author has the right to set boundaries, their reaction might have been harsh. Consoling someone in distress, even if you have to be firm, is generally expected in human interactions. The author's silence and ignoring her emotional state could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author did try to keep things professional and didn't engage further. The girl eventually moved on, suggesting the situation resolved itself. The main question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Some might argue that they were within their rights to set boundaries, but not providing any support during her emotional breakdown could be seen as lacking empathy. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though maintaining professionalism is important, responding to someone's emotional distress with silence and ignoring their feelings can be considered inconsiderate and harsh, especially in a one-on-one setting.\n"
