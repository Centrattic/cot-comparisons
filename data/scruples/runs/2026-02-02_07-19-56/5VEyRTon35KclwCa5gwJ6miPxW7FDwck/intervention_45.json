In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the girl started crying when the author rejected her. The author then tried to keep things professional, which makes sense. But when she tried to profess her feelings again publicly, the author shut her down, leading to another emotional episode. Then, during the ride home, the author didn't console her and even turned up the radio to avoid the conversation.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is in a position of some authority, as they were helping her onboard. The girl is new and younger, which might make the dynamic a bit more sensitive. When someone is clearly upset and seeking emotional support, even if it's not appropriate, the author's response might be seen as neglectful. \n\nBut the author did drop her off and kept things professional. They didn't escalate the situation. However, not offering any empathy during her emotional breakdown\u2014just staying silent and increasing the volume\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn a work environment, maintaining professionalism is important, but there's a balance. If a colleague is in distress, even if it's due to unrequited feelings, a human response like a brief acknowledgment or offering to talk in a professional manner might be expected. The author's silence and avoidance could be perceived as uncaring, even if they weren't responsible for the situation.\n\nBut the author isn't in a romantic relationship with her. They had already set boundaries. However, the way they handled the aftermath\u2014especially during the ride\u2014might lack basic human decency. The fact that she moved on quickly might not absolve the author, as that's her own coping mechanism.\n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not showing any empathy during her emotional distress, even if they were maintaining professional boundaries. There's a difference between being professional and being completely silent and dismissive. The author could have handled it with more compassion without overstepping.\n"
