In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author helped the new girl onboard, which is a professional duty. The girl declared her love early on, and the author told her it was infatuation. She cried, and the author tried to keep things professional. Then, in a team-building event, she publicly confessed again, leading to an emotional outburst. The author didn't console her, turned up the radio, and dropped her off without speaking.\n\nNow, considering professional boundaries. It's important to maintain professionalism at work, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state. The author did back off and keep things professional after the initial rejection, which is reasonable. But when the girl had a breakdown, the author's response was silent and dismissive. While it's true that the author isn't obligated to comfort her, completely ignoring her emotional state might be seen as uncaring. \n\nHowever, the author didn't escalate the situation. They avoided confrontation, kept the ride home calm, and things resolved as the girl moved on. The key points are whether the author acted unprofessionally or inconsiderately. The author's actions were firm but not cruel, especially since they didn't engage further. The girl's own behavior was also a factor\u2014public declarations and emotional outbursts can be unprofessional on her part. But the author's lack of empathy here might be seen as a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, consoling someone after a rejection isn't always necessary. People handle emotions differently. The author might feel they did the right thing by not encouraging the relationship. However, a more compassionate approach, even while setting boundaries, could have been better. \n\nIn many cases, showing a little compassion without getting involved is considered the right approach. So, the author might be in the wrong for not offering any comfort, but then again, they did avoid making it worse. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The author didn't act maliciously, but their lack of any attempt to console could be seen as harsh. So maybe answer A, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
