In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a colleague who had a crush on them. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author is in an IT company, and they helped a new girl who was fresh out of college. She had a crush on him, and he rejected her, leading her to cry. He then kept things professional but didn't console her, even during a public breakup moment. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the initial interaction: when she told him she loved him, he dismissed it as infatuation. That might have been harsh, but maybe he's trying to be honest. However, she cried, which is an emotional reaction. He then changed his behavior to be more professional, which is good for work, but not being consoling could be seen as uncaring.\n\nThen, during the team-building hike, she professed her love again in public. He shut her down, causing her to have a breakdown. He took her home but didn't talk to her, even increasing the radio to drown out her crying. That's where the issue is. Not consoling someone in emotional distress could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe arguments for the author being in the wrong: he didn't show empathy when she was clearly upset. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, acknowledging her feelings and offering some support might be necessary to prevent further distress. The fact that she moved on to someone else might not absolve him of responsibility for how he handled the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, he tried to keep things professional, which is important in a workplace. But handling it with more empathy could have been better. Silence and ignoring her crying might be seen as cruel.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not consoling her during her emotional distress, even though he was trying to maintain professionalism. The way he handled the ride home was particularly harsh. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
