In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a workplace crush and how the author handled it.\n\nFirst, the girl started a new job and had a crush. The author helped her onboarding and was friendly, which is normal. But when she told him she loves him, he said it's infatuation. She cried, and he became more professional, leading to more crying episodes. Then, during a team hike, she professed her love again in public. He shut her down, and she had a breakdown. He took her home but didn't console her, even cranked up the radio when she cried. He didn't apologize and they stayed professional after.\n\nSo, the main question is if he was an asshole for not consoling her. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider workplace dynamics. The author was professional, but handling a colleague's emotional breakdown isn't typical. Even if he didn't have romantic feelings, being dismissive by not offering any comfort could be seen as harsh. However, he didn't escalate the situation, kept it professional, and she moved on. \n\nOn one hand, he's not responsible for her feelings, but in a public setting, some level of empathy might be expected. Increasing the radio volume and staying silent could be seen as uncaring. But since they were coworkers and the relationship was unreciprocated, he might have felt he had to avoid any personal interaction to maintain professionalism. \n\nThe key points are: Did he have a duty to console her? In a workplace, especially when someone is emotionally distressed, even if it's due to personal feelings, there's an expectation to be considerate. His actions (no words, ignoring her distress) could be viewed as neglecting that responsibility. \n\nHowever, he did take her home, which shows some level of care. But not consoling her directly might still be seen as wrong. So, balancing the need for professionalism with empathy. \n\nIn many cases, even if you can't reciprocate feelings, showing empathy is important. His approach might be seen as lacking in that, making him the asshole. So the answer might be A. But others might argue it's B because he wasn't responsible for her emotions. Hmm.\n"
