In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The scenario involves the girl confessing her feelings twice, both times leading to emotional outbursts.\n\nFirst, the author helped onboarding the new employee, which is professional. But when the girl declared her love, the author rejected her, leading to crying. Then, the author distanced themselves professionally to avoid being rude. The second incident was public, and the author shut her down again, leading to more crying. During the ride home, the author didn't console her, even turning up the radio to drown out her emotions.\n\nThe key points here are professionalism and emotional boundaries. The author is in a position of authority, especially since there's an age difference and the girl is new. It's important to maintain professional boundaries in the workplace to avoid any potential harassment claims or uncomfortable situations. The author tried to keep things professional, which is the right approach. However, the way they handled the emotional situation could be seen as harsh. \n\nWhen the girl is emotionally distressed, even if it's due to unrequited feelings, the author's complete silence and increasing the radio volume might be considered insensitive. While it's true that the author isn't obligated to provide emotional support, completely ignoring her and not offering any comfort could come off as cruel. The fact that the author didn't apologize later might also contribute to the perception of being in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's actions\u2014professing love twice and reacting with crying episodes\u2014might be viewed as unprofessional. The author's response was to maintain boundaries, which is necessary in a workplace. However, there's a balance between maintaining professionalism and showing basic human empathy. \n\nThe girl eventually moved on, which suggests that the situation wasn't ongoing, but the initial handling could have been better. The author could have acknowledged her feelings without engaging in a romantic relationship. For example, a firm but kind response, maybe a suggestion to talk to a professional, or redirecting the conversation to work matters. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to stay professional, the lack of any attempt to console her during the emotional distress might be seen as unkind. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because empathy is a human aspect, even if it's not required in a professional setting. However, maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. There's a nuance here. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A because not providing any comfort could be considered harsh, even if the initial rejection was justified.\n"
