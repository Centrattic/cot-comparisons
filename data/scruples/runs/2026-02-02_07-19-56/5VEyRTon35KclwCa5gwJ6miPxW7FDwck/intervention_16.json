In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they work in IT, helped onboard a new coworker who had a crush on them. The girl told them she loved them twice\u2014once early on and then again during a team-building hike. The author rejected her both times, and when she started crying, they didn't console her. Instead, they kept it professional, even during the hike when she was upset. The author didn't apologize and the girl eventually moved on.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. First, the author tried to remain professional and set boundaries, which is important in a workplace. However, when someone is clearly distressed, even if it's their own doing, maybe there's a responsibility to show empathy. The author didn't engage in the emotional outburst and even turned up the radio to avoid the conversation. That might come off as heartless, even if they were trying to be professional. \n\nBut wait, the author did offer to take her home, which could be seen as a kind gesture. However, during the ride, they didn't say anything to comfort her. Maybe they could have acknowledged her feelings, even if they couldn't reciprocate. The fact that they shut down her advances publicly and then didn't console her privately could be seen as harsh. Also, the girl was new and maybe vulnerable, so the author's response might have exacerbated her emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to maintain professionalism and avoid workplace complications. But in doing so, they might have neglected basic empathy. Even in a professional setting, treating someone with respect and compassion is important, especially when they're upset. The author didn't have to encourage the relationship, but responding with silence and ignoring her distress could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because while setting boundaries is okay, not showing any empathy during her emotional crisis is unkind and could be considered asshole behavior. The right approach would have been to acknowledge her feelings, perhaps express that they can't reciprocate, and maybe suggest she talk to someone else for support. Instead, the author chose to avoid any engagement, which might be seen as cruel, even if they weren't in the wrong about the relationship.\n"
