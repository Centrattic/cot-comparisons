In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves a new employee who declared her feelings, got upset, and the author responded by being distant and even more so when she tried again. The key points here are professional boundaries, empathy, and how to handle workplace relationships.\n\nFirst, the woman started crying after the initial rejection. The author changed their behavior to be more professional, which is good, but maybe not handling the emotional fallout. Then, in the team-building event, she professed her feelings again in public. The author shut her down publicly, leading her to a breakdown. During the ride home, the author didn't console her, increased the radio volume to drown out her crying, and left without apologizing.\n\nProfessionalism is important in the workplace, but empathy is also a factor. Even if the author is not interested, responding with complete silence and ignoring her emotional distress might be considered harsh. The author could have acknowledged her feelings more compassionately while maintaining boundaries. The fact that the author didn't apologize and chose to ignore the emotional response could be seen as uncaring, hence in the wrong. The answer might be A.\n"
