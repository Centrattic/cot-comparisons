In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is that a new girl starts at their company, and the author helped her get on boarded. The girl, who's fresh out of college and there's an age difference, tells the author she loves him. He responds by saying it's infatuation and she doesn't really love him, causing her to cry. Then he keeps things professional, which leads to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again in public, and he shuts her down, leading to a breakdown. On the way back, she cries and screams, and he just sits in silence, turns up the radio, and doesn't console her. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author tried to be professional, helped her onboarding, but the girl developed a crush. The first time she declared her feelings, he dismissed it as infatuation, which might have been harsh. Then he minimized interaction, leading to her emotional outbursts. Publicly, she tried again, and he shut her down, which probably hurt her more. His response during the ride back was to be silent and increase the radio volume, not offering any comfort. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is it the author's responsibility to console someone who's upset because of his rejections? In a workplace setting, maintaining professional boundaries is important. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, especially under his care during a ride home, there's a social expectation to offer some comfort unless there's a valid reason not to. The author's actions could be seen as cold or uncaring. Even if he wasn't responsible for her feelings, once she was in distress, his response might have been inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the girl was new, possibly more vulnerable, and maybe he had a role in her onboarding. His silence and lack of empathy during her breakdown could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment, even if it wasn't intentional. The fact that she moved on quickly might suggest she wasn't severely harmed, but the immediate situation involved her emotional well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, he maintained professionalism at work afterward, which is positive. But the personal interaction during the ride home wasn't a work setting, so maybe the expectations differ. However, he voluntarily chose to accompany her, so he might have had a duty to ensure her well-being in that situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether his response was asshole behavior. While he wasn't obligated to have a relationship or to console her, his complete lack of response during her emotional crisis could be seen as inconsiderate. People often expect some level of empathy in such situations. So, the author might be in the wrong for not providing any comfort, even if he wasn't responsible for causing her feelings initially. The answer could lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his response was uncaring when she was clearly distressed.\n"
