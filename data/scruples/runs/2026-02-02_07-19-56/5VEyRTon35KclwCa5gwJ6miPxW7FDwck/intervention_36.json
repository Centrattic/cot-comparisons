In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a new coworker with a crush on the author. The author helped her onboarding, then when she expressed love, they told her it was infatuation. The girl cried, and the author became more distant, which led to more crying. Later, in a team-building hike, she professed her feelings again publicly. The author shut her down, and during the ride home, she was upset but the author didn't console her and raised the radio instead. The author never apologized and the girl moved on.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They initially helped the new coworker, which is normal. When the coworker expressed love, the author rejected her, which is their right. However, the way they handled the subsequent interactions might be the issue. After the first rejection, the author made the communication minimal and professional, which sent the girl into more crying. Then, during the hike, when she tried again, the author shut her down harshly, leading to a public breakdown. The ride home was where the author didn't console her and instead increased the radio volume when she cried. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a professional setting, it's important to maintain boundaries but also to be considerate. The author's initial response was direct, but the follow-up actions might lack empathy. When someone is in emotional distress, especially a younger coworker, it's expected to show some level of compassion. The author's silence and increasing the radio could be seen as dismissive and uncaring. The fact that the girl was new, younger, and possibly more vulnerable adds to the situation. The author didn't have to console her, but their response could be seen as harsh. The key points here are the public rejection and the lack of empathy during her emotional breakdown. \n\nHowever, the author maintains that they kept it professional and didn't apologize, which some might argue is their right. The girl did move on, so maybe the author's actions weren't malicious. But the method of handling the situation could be better. The answer might depend on cultural or situational norms. In many workplaces, it's expected to handle such situations with care to avoid further distress. Therefore, the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate or even cruel, making them at fault.\n"
