In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a workplace crush and how the author handled it.\n\nFirst, the author helped a new colleague who was much younger and fresh out of college. The girl had a crush and made her feelings known, which the author dismissed as infatuation. The author then tried to keep things professional, which led to the girl crying. The key points here are the power dynamic and the author's response.\n\nIn a professional setting, especially with a junior employee, it's important to maintain boundaries. The author did try to keep things professional after the girl expressed her feelings, which is good. However, when the girl broke down emotionally, the author didn't console her. Instead, they increased the radio volume and stayed silent. That might come off as cold or dismissive. \n\nEven though the author wasn't in a romantic relationship with her, responding to emotional distress with silence and ignoring her pain isn't ideal. There's a difference between maintaining professionalism and being emotionally supportive. The author could have acknowledged her feelings without getting involved romantically. \n\nAlso, considering the girl moved on quickly, maybe the author's actions didn't cause long-term harm, but the immediate handling of the situation could be seen as uncaring. In a workplace, empathy is important even if you can't engage romantically. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not providing some level of comfort, even if they kept things professional otherwise. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because emotional support is part of being a colleague, especially when someone is clearly distressed.\n"
