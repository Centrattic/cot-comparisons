In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves two main parts: the initial rejection and the subsequent handling during the team-building hike.\n\nFirst, when the new employee declared her love early on, the author responded by saying it was infatuation and kept their interactions professional. The girl cried, and the author changed their behavior to be minimal. But that led to more crying. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong in not providing comfort, especially during the hike incident where the girl tried to confess again publicly, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nIn the hike scenario, the author shut her down, then during the ride home, didn't console her, turned up the radio, and dropped her off. The key points here are professional boundaries and empathy. The author maintained professionalism, which is important in the workplace. However, when someone is clearly upset and vulnerable, even if the feelings aren't mutual, showing some level of empathy could be considered necessary. The author's silence and turning up the radio might be seen as dismissive or uncaring, even if they didn't want to engage in a conversation. \n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the author tried to keep things professional and might not have wanted to encourage the feelings further. However, in a situation where the person is emotionally distressed, especially after being rejected, not offering any comfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The P.S. mentions the girl moved on, but that doesn't mitigate the immediate impact on her emotions.\n\nProfessionalism is important, but so is human decency. The author's actions might be seen as crossing the line from professional to being an asshole by not showing any empathy during the girl's emotional crisis. So, while maintaining boundaries is good, the lack of any consolation could make the author at fault here.\n"
