I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl. \n\nFirst, the background: The author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a significant part of his life. He's been doing this for years before the relationship. The girl has been seeing him for a year and has started getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others about not seeing him enough. She then asks him to skip the gym once a week. He refuses, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nThe author argues that working out is his main hobby, essential for him, and he wouldn't ask her to skip something she cares about. He's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his priorities. But the girl is upset because she feels neglected and wants more time. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. Both need to find a balance. However, the author is not making a demand but setting a boundary. The girl's reaction of being cold and criticizing his priorities might be unfair, especially since he's already making time on weekends. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. Maybe the author could consider adjusting a day occasionally, but he's not wrong to set a limit. The girl's expectations might be unrealistic if she's expecting a weekly shift in his routine. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about his non-negotiables. The problem might be the girl's approach and expectations. So the answer is B.\n"
