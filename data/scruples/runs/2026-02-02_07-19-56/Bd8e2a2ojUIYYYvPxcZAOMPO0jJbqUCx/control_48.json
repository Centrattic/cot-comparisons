I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his life and his main hobby. He's been doing this for over 6.5 years, and it's clear that it's important to him. He works from 8:30 am to 6 pm Monday to Saturday, so after work, he goes to the gym. By the time he's done, it's 8:30-9 pm, and he's too tired to do anything else but watch Netflix with his cat. They already hang out on Friday or Saturday nights every week.\n\nThe girl he's been seeing for a year mentions getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family that he doesn't see her enough. She then asks him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He says no, and she's been acting cold and upset for three days, saying she sees his priorities.\n\nThe author doesn't think he's wrong because working out is his only consistent hobby, and he even told her he wouldn't expect her to sacrifice her own weekly hobby. He's willing to do it occasionally but feels once a week is too much. The girl's intention is to spend more time together, but the author is firm on his refusal.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual expectations in the relationship. The author has been clear about his commitment to the gym, which is a significant part of his identity and well-being. He's already spending time with her twice a week. The girl may feel neglected, but it's important to consider if her request is reasonable given the author's circumstances. \n\nHowever, relationships often require compromise. The girl might feel that the author isn't willing to make that necessary adjustment for her. But the author is also asserting his own needs and boundaries. If the girl is unhappy with the current arrangement, maybe she should communicate her needs better and find ways to be together without compromising his routine. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't about not caring but about maintaining his personal priorities. The girl's reaction of being \"a dick\" and icy might be disproportionate. The author isn't doing anything he hasn't been consistent about for years. So, is he in the wrong? It depends on the balance of needs and communication. Since he's already making time for her and is clear about his limits, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the relationship requires more time than he's willing to give, that's a bigger issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is standing by his priorities and the girl's reaction seems harsh. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The fact that they've been in a relationship for a year and the girl is now asking for this change might indicate she's not happy, but the author's stance is valid if he's not compromising his well-being. So yeah, probably B.\n"
