I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for years. He's been seeing a girl for a year, and she wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and now she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main point is that working out is a significant part of his life, his hobby, and he's consistent with it. He mentions that he only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights, which are the only times they hang out. He's clear that he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly hobby either. The girl, on the other hand, feels neglected and is reacting emotionally to his refusal to make time for her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is the author being unreasonable? He's not changing his routine for her, which is his main hobby. But relationships often require flexibility. However, the author has been consistent about his commitment to the gym long before the relationship. The girl's request is about spending more time together, which is a common relationship need. But the author isn't willing to compromise on something he values highly. \n\nIs the author wrong for not adjusting? Well, relationships are a two-way street. If one person's needs are consistently prioritized over the other's, that can be an issue. The author isn't completely unwilling to compromise\u2014maybe occasionally\u2014but not weekly. However, the girl's reaction of being \"a dick\" and giving the cold shoulder might be a bit harsh if he's already making time on weekends. But the author isn't wrong for having boundaries. He's honest about his priorities. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girl's request is reasonable, but the author's refusal without trying to find another solution is part of the problem. Maybe there's another way to spend time together without him sacrificing his routine. But the author does mention that after work and the gym, he's too tired. His time is limited. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He communicated his boundaries clearly and stuck to them. The girl's expectations might be unrealistic given his commitment to the gym. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
