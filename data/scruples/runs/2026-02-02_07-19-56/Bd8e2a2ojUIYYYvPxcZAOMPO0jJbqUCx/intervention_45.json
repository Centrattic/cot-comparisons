I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to skip the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more. The person initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a significant time commitment. He mentions that his body might be what attracted the girl, and that lifting is his main hobby. He's working 8:30-6 Mon-Sat, so his free time is probably limited. He currently spends Friday or Saturday night with her each week. The girl is upset because she's feeling neglected, as others are giving her \"weird vibes,\" and she's asking him to adjust his routine. The author says no, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key here is about communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The girl is expressing a need for more time together, which is a common issue in relationships. The author values his gym time as a hobby and a priority. But relationships require compromise. If the girl is feeling like they're not spending enough time together, expecting some adjustment might be reasonable. The author is not willing to skip a weekly session, which he's been doing for years. However, he might not be considering her feelings enough. He says he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly activities, which shows he understands her side, but he still refuses to make any change. \n\nThe girl's reaction is also extreme, but the author's refusal to even consider a compromise might be the issue. Maybe he's not being flexible enough. Even if he's not willing to skip entirely, perhaps suggesting alternative ways to spend time together without him missing the gym. For example, maybe they could have a lunch date during the week or adjust the weekend hangouts to be more flexible. But the author is firm in his stance. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a legitimate reason to value his gym time. If it's his main hobby and a source of happiness, denying that could lead to his own dissatisfaction. But in relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices sometimes. The problem might be that the author didn't acknowledge her feelings and just said no without offering alternatives. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the refusal was communicated in a way that's respectful. The author says he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own activities, which is good, but maybe he didn't express that he values their time together and is open to finding other ways to connect. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the short answer is that the author isn't in the wrong if he's not willing to compromise on something that's important to him, but he might be missing an opportunity to show empathy and find a middle ground. However, the way he handled the situation could be improved. But based on the question, the options are A (he is wrong) or B (he isn't). Considering that the girl is asking for a specific change and he's not willing to do it, while also not offering alternatives, it might lean towards A. But if the gym is a non-negotiable part of his life, then B. I'm a bit torn, but since the girl's feelings are valid and the author is not making any effort to adjust, maybe A is the right choice.\n"
