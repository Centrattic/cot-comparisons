I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break this down.\n\nThe person works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of their life and a hobby they really enjoy. They've been with this girl for a year, and she's mentioned that she's getting negative vibes from others and her family about them not seeing each other enough. She then asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time together. He refuses because he doesn't skip unless necessary, and now she's been acting cold and upset, saying she sees where his priorities are and will stop caring.\n\nFrom the background info, the author makes it clear that working out is a significant part of his routine and happiness. He's been doing it for years, and it's his main hobby. He and the girl already have regular time together: Friday or Saturday nights. The girl's request is to have more time, but he's unwilling to sacrifice a weekly habit he values highly. He also notes that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly activities for him, so he's being consistent in that.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual expectations in a relationship. If the girl feels her family and others are concerned about their time together, maybe she feels the relationship is not as strong as it could be. But the author is standing by his commitment to his hobby, which he's had long before the relationship. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by not altering his routine.\n\nPossible angles: In relationships, compromise is important. The girl might feel that her emotional needs are being overlooked. However, the author is also valid in valuing his personal time and interests. The issue might be how the girl is reacting\u2014being upset and cold for three days might be an overreaction, but her feelings are real. The author could be in the wrong if not making an effort to adjust for her, but if communication is open and he's explained his boundaries, maybe not. The \"asshole\" part is usually about disrespect or refusal to consider the other person's feelings. He did consider her feelings by explaining his stance, but she might need more time. So, it's a balance. \n\nBut the Reddit context often leans towards the person who is being flexible or adapting, but in this case, the author is being consistent. The answer might be B (No), because he's not necessarily wrong, but the situation is nuanced. The girl's reaction is harsh, but her desire for more time is understandable. If he's already giving her regular time and the main issue is a weekly commitment to a hobby, it's a matter of mutual needs. The author isn't disregarding the relationship but is maintaining his own well-being through his routine. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
