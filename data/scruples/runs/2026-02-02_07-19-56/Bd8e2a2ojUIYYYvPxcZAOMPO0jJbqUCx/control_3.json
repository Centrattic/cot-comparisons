I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole. The background is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is important to him. The girl he's seeing for a year says she's getting vibes from people and her family that they don't see each other enough. She then asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refuses, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's argument is that working out is his main hobby, he's consistent with it, and he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly activities. He sees her every Friday or Saturday night. He's not willing to skip one day a week for her. The girl is upset because she feels she isn't a priority.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective is that she wants more time with him and is asking for a compromise. She might feel that his commitment to the gym is making it hard to spend quality time together. She's trying to communicate her needs, but when he refuses, she reacts negatively. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. Is there a reasonable expectation here? The key points are communication and mutual respect. The girl brought up her feelings and asked for a change. The author refused, which is his right, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. However, he did explain his reasoning and even offered to compromise occasionally. The girl's reaction over three days of being cold and passive-aggressive might be her fault too. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being honest about his priorities and not forcing her to skip her own activities, then he's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's not making an effort to find a middle ground, maybe there's a problem. But in the scenario, he does see her every Friday or Saturday night. So maybe the issue is that she wants more than that. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to make compromises. If the author is unwilling to adjust even a little, that could be an issue. But the girl's approach might not be effective either. The author isn't forcing her to stay; she's choosing to be with him. If she can't accept his priorities, maybe that's a compatibility issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole. The girl's reaction is immature, but the author isn't wrong for sticking to his priorities. He's communicated clearly and offered some flexibility. Therefore, answer B.\n"
