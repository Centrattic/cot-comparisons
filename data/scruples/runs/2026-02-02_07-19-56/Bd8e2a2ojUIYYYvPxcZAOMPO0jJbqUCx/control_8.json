I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a relationship where they go to the gym 6-7 days a week, which is their main hobby. The girl they're seeing wants him to skip one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that the gym is his main hobby, he's been doing it for years, and it's important to him. He even mentions that she might have been attracted to his physique. He also says he's making an exception for her by considering skipping occasionally, but not weekly. On the other hand, the girl is feeling neglected, getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, so she wants more time together. She's been upset after his refusal.\n\nNow, relationships require compromise. If both partners have things they're passionate about, they need to find a balance. The author's refusal might be seen as not compromising enough. However, he's not being asked to give up his hobby entirely but to adjust it slightly. But then again, maybe the issue is deeper. Is the girl's request reasonable? Skipping one day a week might not be a huge sacrifice for the author, but for someone who's done it for so long, it could be significant.\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction of being \"a dick and ice cold\" for three days might indicate she's handling it poorly, but her feelings of wanting more attention are valid. The author did say he's willing to consider occasional skips, but not weekly. The key here is communication. Did the author explain his reasons clearly? He did mention he wouldn't skip unless necessary, which she already knew.\n\nAnother angle: relationships often require both parties to make adjustments. If the girl is feeling neglected, maybe there's an underlying issue about time management or other areas where they can find common ground. But if the author is unwilling to adjust even a little, that might be a problem. However, he's not refusing all adjustments\u2014just weekly. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on the balance of their needs. If she's asking for a reasonable amount of time and he's unwilling to meet her halfway, maybe he is. But if his hobby is a non-negotiable part of his life and he's already giving her time on Friday or Saturday, perhaps it's not his fault. The girl might need to find other ways to feel more connected without changing his routine. But in a healthy relationship, mutual adjustments are expected. If he's not willing to adjust at all, even a little, maybe he's being rigid. However, he's not completely refusing to adjust\u2014only once a week, which he finds ludicrous. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. The girl wants more connection, which is valid, but the author's hobby is a core part of his identity. If he's making an exception for occasional skips, that's a compromise. The problem might be her reaction rather than his refusal. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue he should be more flexible. The key is that he's not being asked to stop entirely. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
