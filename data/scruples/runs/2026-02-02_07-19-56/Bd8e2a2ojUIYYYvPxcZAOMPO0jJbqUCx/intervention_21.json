I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for over six years. It's a significant part of his routine and his main hobby. He works long hours and comes home tired, so his gym time is probably a way to unwind and stay in shape. He does see her on Friday or Saturday nights, which is weekly. The girl feels she's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family because she thinks they don't spend enough time together. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more, but he refused, leading to her being upset and giving him the cold shoulder.\n\nThe key points here are about priorities and communication. The author values his gym time as a non-negotiable part of his life. He also communicates that he wouldn't expect her to give up something weekly, which shows he's trying to be fair. However, his girlfriend feels neglected and is using the gym as a way to increase their time together. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his limits. He's not asking her to sacrifice her own priorities, but he's unwilling to do the same. The problem might be that the girlfriend's request is about quantity versus quality. Maybe they need to talk about how they spend the time they have together, not just the amount. The author might not be in the wrong for not changing his habits, but perhaps he could find ways to make the time they do have more meaningful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend feels consistently neglected, that's a valid concern. The author might need to find a middle ground, like maybe adjusting his schedule slightly or finding other activities they can do together that don't require him to skip the gym. But from the description, he's already making time for her once a week. The issue is whether skipping the gym once a week is a reasonable request. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling unimportant to him. The author could consider that even if he can't skip the gym, maybe there are other ways to show he values her. However, the core question is about the author's actions. Since he's being honest and sticking to his boundaries, he's not in the wrong. The problem might be in their communication and how they balance their needs.\n"
