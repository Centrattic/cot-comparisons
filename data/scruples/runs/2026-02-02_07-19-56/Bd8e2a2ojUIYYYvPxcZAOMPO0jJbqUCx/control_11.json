I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a relationship where he works out 6-7 days a week, which the girl he's seeing says is her main attraction. He's been doing this for years, and it's his main hobby. The girl is upset because she's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family about not seeing him enough. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refuses, and she's been acting cold and upset since then. He argues that he's not being unreasonable since it's his only hobby and he told her he wouldn't expect her to change her priorities. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that working out is a big part of his life, it's his hobby, and he's been consistent with it. He's not willing to give up a day of the gym. The girl's perspective is that she wants more time with him and is feeling neglected, leading to her acting out. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual respect. The author is clear that his gym routine is non-negotiable, but maybe he didn't consider how his refusal would affect her feelings. On the other hand, the girl's reaction of being cold and giving \"shit\" might be a form of punishment, which isn't healthy. However, relationships require compromise. If the girl feels she's not getting enough attention, maybe there's a middle ground they could have explored. The author could have suggested alternative ways to spend time together without sacrificing his routine. For example, maybe they could find other days or activities that don't require him to skip the gym. But he didn't offer alternatives, just a flat \"no.\" \n\nBut is he in the wrong for not wanting to skip the gym? It's his hobby, and he's communicated that before. The girl might have known this when she started the relationship. However, relationships do require some level of sacrifice. If the girl is feeling neglected, it's a valid concern. The author's refusal to adjust might come off as not prioritizing her in the relationship. Yet, it's also about setting boundaries. \n\nThe girl's reaction seems extreme too. If she's upset, she should communicate that without being cold. But the author didn't make an effort to see things from her perspective either. Maybe he could have said, \"I see your point, but I can't skip the gym. However, maybe we can find another way to spend time together.\" But he didn't do that. He just said no, leading to her frustration. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's standing by his personal priorities. On the other hand, not being open to compromise might be an issue. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If both parties have valid points, but the girl's reaction was unkind, maybe he's not at fault. However, relationships need give and take. If he's unwilling to adjust even a little, that could be a problem. But given that he's been consistent and communicated that he won't expect her to change her habits, maybe he's not in the wrong here. The answer might be B, no, he isn't the asshole. However, there's room for improvement in how he could have handled it.\n"
