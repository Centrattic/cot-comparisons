I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and his girlfriend wants him to skip one day to spend more time with her. He refused, and now she's upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The guy says working out is his main hobby, he's been doing it for 6.5 years, and it's part of his routine. He's been seeing the girl for a year, and they hang out on Friday or Saturday. The girl is getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, leading her to feel like he doesn't see her enough. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week, but he says no. She then starts treating him coldly and making comments about priorities.\n\nThe guy argues that he's not expecting her to give up her hobbies, and he's okay with skipping occasionally but not weekly. He feels she's overreacting. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require compromise. If the girl feels neglected, it's valid for her to express that. But the guy's commitment to his routine is longstanding. However, the way he refused might have been abrupt. Did he make any effort to find a middle ground? The post says he told her he could understand if she wanted occasional skips but not weekly. Maybe he could have suggested other ways to spend time together without cutting his routine. But he did mention he's already spending time with her twice a week. \n\nThe girl's reaction is harsh, but her feelings are valid. The guy's stance is about personal priorities. It's a balance. If he's unwilling to adjust even a little, maybe that's part of the problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to meet in the middle. If he's not flexible, that could be an issue. But he's also clear about his boundaries. The problem might be communication. Maybe he could have been more empathetic. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not if both sides have valid points. \n\nI think the key here is that the girl is feeling neglected and he's not willing to make even a small adjustment. But he's also not wrong for not wanting to change a significant part of his routine. It's more of a 50/50 situation. But the question is whether he's the asshole. Since he didn't refuse outright and explained his position, maybe he's not in the wrong. But perhaps he could have been more accommodating. \n\nHmm. The answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong), but with a note that both sides have valid points. However, the user wants a strict A or B. So, considering that he's clear about his limits and she's overreacting, maybe B is the answer.\n"
