I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a relationship where they've been seeing someone for a year. The girl is upset because he won't skip his gym routine once a week to spend more time together. The author explains that working out is his main hobby, a big part of his life for over six years, and that he's already seeing her on Friday or Saturday nights each week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid point that his gym time is a non-negotiable part of his life, and he's made an exception for her in terms of weekly meetups. He also mentions that he's willing to make occasional sacrifices but not weekly. On the other hand, the girl feels she's not getting enough attention and is upset when he refuses to adjust his routine. She's taken it as a priority issue, leading to her acting cold towards him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author clearly communicated his boundaries, and the girl's reaction seems harsh. However, relationships require compromise. The girl's request for more time might be reasonable, but expecting him to give up a significant part of his routine weekly could be too much. The author isn't refusing to make any effort; he's already meeting her twice a week. If the girl is unhappy with that, maybe she needs to communicate her needs better or consider if the relationship is balanced for both parties.\n\nAlso, the girl's response of being a \"dick\" and acting cold after a straightforward answer might indicate she's not respecting his boundaries. The author isn't wrong for having his own priorities, especially when he's already making time for her. The issue might be more about the girl's expectations and how she's handling the situation rather than the author being in the wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (Not the Asshole) here.\n"
