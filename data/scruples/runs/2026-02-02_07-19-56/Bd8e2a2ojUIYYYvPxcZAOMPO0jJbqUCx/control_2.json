I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl he's seeing. \n\nFirst, the author has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years. That's a long-standing habit and a major part of his life. He mentions that lifting is his main hobby, and he's happy with it. He doesn't have other hobbies mentioned, so the gym is a big deal for him. He works long hours (8:30-6 Mon-Sat), gets home late, and then does the gym. Then he spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights.\n\nThe girl is getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family about not seeing enough of him. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He says no, and she's been acting cold, saying she sees his priorities.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a legitimate passion and routine. He's clear that he's not willing to skip the gym, which is a personal boundary. He's also consistent in his answer, and he's explained that he wouldn't expect her to give up her own hobbies. So he's being honest about his priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel neglected. If she's been with him for a year, she might feel that their relationship isn't getting the attention it needs. But the author is balancing work and his hobby, which is understandable. However, relationships do require time and effort. But he's already spending time with her on the weekend. Maybe she expects more, but is it fair to ask him to sacrifice his only hobby?\n\nThe key points are mutual respect for each other's priorities. The author isn't forcing her to give up her time, but she's asking him to. He's clear he won't. He's not in the wrong for setting boundaries. The girl's reaction might be overreacting, but that's her responsibility. The author is being honest, so he's not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
