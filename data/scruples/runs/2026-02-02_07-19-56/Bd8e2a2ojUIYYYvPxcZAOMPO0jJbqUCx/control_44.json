I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's been dating a girl for a year, and she wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refuses, and she's upset. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years. It's a major part of his life, his main hobby, and it's something he loves. He works long hours and by the time he gets home, he's tired and just wants to relax. They already see each other on Friday or Saturday nights. So, he's not exactly spending zero time with her. \n\nThe girl is saying she's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family about not seeing him enough. Then she asks him to skip the gym one day a week. He says no, and she's been acting cold towards him, even saying she'll stop caring. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's think about communication and expectations in a relationship. The girl might feel that her needs for more time together aren't being met, and she's trying to express that. But asking him to give up a daily activity that's important to him might be a big ask. On the other hand, the author mentions that he's willing to compromise if she wanted him to do it occasionally, but not weekly. \n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't willing to sacrifice a significant part of his routine, which is understandable. But the girl might feel that he's not meeting her emotional needs, leading to her frustration. \n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate; he's explaining his position and why he can't do it. However, the girl's reaction of being cold and accusing him of not prioritizing her could be problematic. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable if he's already making time for her once a week. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps they could find other ways to spend time together without him giving up the gym. The author's stance is that his hobby is important, and he's not willing to give up something that brings him joy. That's his right. \n\nIn relationships, both people need to make adjustments. However, if one partner feels their needs are not being met, communication is key. The girl might need to express her feelings better and explore other options for spending time together. The author, on his part, could consider if there are other ways to show he's making an effort without skipping the gym. \n\nBut in this case, the author isn't being unreasonable. He's clear about his limits, and the girl's overreaction might be the issue. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
