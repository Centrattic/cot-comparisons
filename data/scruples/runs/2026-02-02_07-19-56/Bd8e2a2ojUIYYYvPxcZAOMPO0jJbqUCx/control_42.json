I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author works out 6-7 days a week, which they've done for over six years. It's a big part of their life and their main hobby. They work long hours, from 8:30 AM to 6 PM Monday to Saturday, with normal hours being 9-5 Monday to Friday. After work, they go to the gym, which means they're home around 8:30 PM to 9 PM, then relax with their cat and watch Netflix. They see the girl either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nThe girl has been getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family because she feels the author doesn't see her enough. She then asks the author to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. The author refuses, explaining that they can't skip gym days. The girl responds by being cold and distant, saying she sees where his priorities are and that she won't care anymore.\n\nThe author argues that they're not being unreasonable. They mention that they would never expect her to give up something weekly that she cares about. They understand if she wanted them to do it occasionally but not weekly. The author feels that the girl is overreacting and treating them like an asshole for saying no.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B). Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe girl wants more time with the author, which is a common relationship need. The author has a major commitment to the gym, which is important for their health and well-being. The author has been consistent with their routine for years. They do see her once a week, but maybe the girl feels that's not enough. However, the author's refusal is based on personal priorities and they're clear about their stance. The girl's reaction seems harsh, especially since she initiated the request and the author was honest.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The girl might need to express her needs more clearly, while the author is standing by their own commitments. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for maintaining their boundaries, especially if they're willing to meet occasionally but not weekly. The girl's response seems disproportionate. The author isn't refusing to compromise entirely but is firm on their commitment to the gym. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
