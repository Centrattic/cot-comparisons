I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the man works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his life for 6.5 years. His girlfriend (or partner) is upset because she's getting \"weird vibes\" from others and her family about not seeing him enough. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her, but he refuses, and she's been acting cold since then.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man's perspective is that the gym is his main hobby, he's been doing it for years, and it's a significant part of his routine. He also mentions that he sees her on Friday or Saturday nights every week. He's not willing to cut back a day a week, and he doesn't think he's in the wrong for that. The woman, on the other hand, feels unappreciated or neglected, leading her to push for more time together, and when he refuses, she becomes distant and critical.\n\nI should think about relationship dynamics here. Communication is key. The man says he's communicated that his gym time is non-negotiable, similar to how he'd respect her commitments. But the woman's feelings are hurt because she feels her needs aren't being met. Is it fair for her to ask for a weekly change that's important to him? And is it fair for her to respond with coldness and criticism?\n\nThe man's routine is well-established. He's clear about his boundaries. He's not asking her to sacrifice her own interests, but she's asking him to adjust his primary hobby. There's a balance in relationships where both partners need to compromise. If one partner's needs are causing the other to feel like they have to abandon a significant part of their life, that's a red flag. However, if the other partner feels neglected, that's also a valid concern.\n\nBut the woman's reaction\u2014being \"a dick and ice cold\" after the refusal\u2014might be more about her communication style. Maybe she feels hurt and is expressing it poorly. The man isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if he's already making time for her once a week. If she's not happy with the current arrangement, maybe she's not considering his needs equally. However, expecting a partner to give up a major part of their identity for the relationship could also be a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the man isn't wrong for refusing to skip the gym, as it's a core part of his routine and he's already making time for her. The issue might be more about how they handle their differing priorities and communication. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
