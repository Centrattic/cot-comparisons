I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not skipping the gym to see their girlfriend more. The background is that he works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his life for years. The girl he's been dating for a year is getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, thinking he doesn't see her enough. She then asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and she's been upset, calling out his priorities.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He sees working out as a key part of his routine and happiness. He's clear that he won't skip it, and he even acknowledges that his body attracted her. He's also consistent in seeing her on Friday or Saturday nights. He's trying to be fair by not expecting her to give up her own weekly activities. He feels he's justified in not changing his schedule and is frustrated by her reaction.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she's feeling neglected. Her family and others are giving her vibes that the relationship isn't a priority. She's asking for a compromise\u2014just one day a week less gym to spend time together. When he refuses, she becomes distant and critical. She might feel that her needs aren't being considered, especially if she's already making time on specific nights. Maybe she wants more regular interaction beyond what's currently happening.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key here is balance in the relationship. While he has a valid personal commitment to the gym, relationships require mutual adjustments. If she's feeling that the time spent is insufficient, even once a week, it's a communication issue. The author might not see the gym as a problem, but if the relationship is supposed to be a partnership, both sides should find a middle ground. He's not willing to adjust even a little, which could be seen as not prioritizing her feelings. However, he's also clear about his boundaries, which is important. It's a bit of a gray area. If the current arrangement isn't working for her, maybe he should reconsider. But if he's not willing to make any changes, that's where the issue lies. The girlfriend's reaction is also extreme, but the author's refusal might have triggered it. So, maybe he's partly at fault for not finding a compromise, but it's not entirely his fault. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's not budging and she's feeling neglected, maybe he is. So answer A.\n"
