I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his routine and identity. He's been seeing a girl for about a year, and she wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and now she's upset with him, giving him the cold shoulder and making comments about his priorities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, the gym is his main hobby and a key part of his daily schedule. He's been doing it for 6.5 years, and it's something that makes him happy. He mentions that he's willing to understand if she wanted him to skip occasionally, but not weekly. He also points out that he doesn't expect her to change her habits for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl is feeling neglected because she's getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others. She wants more time with him, which is a valid desire in a relationship. The way she transitioned from expressing her feelings to making demands might be a point of contention. She's reacting strongly by becoming distant and critical, which the author finds unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not adjusting his routine. I need to assess if his refusal is unreasonable. The author's gym time is a significant commitment and a source of his happiness, so it's understandable that he's reluctant to give up a day. However, relationships often require compromise. If the girl is feeling like there's not enough time together, maybe both parties need to find a middle ground. The author is not entirely in the wrong because he's being honest about his priorities, but the situation might also require him to consider her feelings. The girl's reaction of becoming \"ice cold\" and making accusatory remarks could be seen as unconstructive, but the author's refusal without offering alternatives might contribute to the tension. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author should have been more flexible. Since he's been in this routine for years and it's integral to his life, expecting him to drop a weekly session might be too much. However, maybe there's a way to adjust schedules or find other times to meet without compromising his gym time. The author's stance seems reasonable, but the way he presented his refusal and whether he's open to other solutions might affect the outcome. Since the question is about being in the wrong, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he's standing by his priorities, especially when he's communicated clearly and she knew his stance beforehand.\n"
