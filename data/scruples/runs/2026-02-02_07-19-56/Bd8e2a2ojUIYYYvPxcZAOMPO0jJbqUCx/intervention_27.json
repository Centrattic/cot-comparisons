I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, and the girl he's dating wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He said no, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that working out is his main hobby, he's done it for years, and it's part of his routine. He's only seeing her on Friday or Saturday nights. She's saying she's getting weird vibes from her family and others about not seeing him enough, and she wanted him to adjust his schedule. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author states that he told her he wouldn't skip the gym, which is a significant part of his life, and that he even acknowledged her perspective. However, she's responding with coldness and criticism about priorities. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to change his routine? Well, everyone has their own priorities. If the author is clear that he's not willing to adjust, that's his right. But maybe the issue is about not finding a middle ground. For example, could they find other times to meet during the week besides just Friday or Saturday? The author says he's busy with work and the gym, but perhaps there's a possibility of adjusting their schedule in a way that isn't sacrificing a gym day entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's concern about not seeing him enough might be valid. If the relationship is supposed to be balanced, maybe the author isn't making enough effort. But he's already giving specific time each week. It's possible that she wants more than that, and that's a valid feeling. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for saying no. If the girl is feeling neglected despite the weekly meetings, then maybe the author should consider her feelings more. However, if he's already making time for her once or twice a week, and the only issue is her desire for more time, then he's not necessarily wrong. It's a matter of mutual expectations. The author might not be wrong if he's honest about his priorities, but maybe he could have suggested alternative ways to spend time together without skipping the gym. \n\nThe girl's reaction (being cold, saying she'll stop caring) seems excessive if the author is upfront. But the author did say he's open to occasional changes, not just weekly. So maybe the problem is the girl's expectation versus the author's refusal. The author might not be in the wrong because he's clear about his boundaries, but the girl might feel unaddressed if her needs aren't met. \n\nI think both sides have valid points. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own time, but maybe there's a need for more communication. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since he's consistent and clear, and he's already making time, I'd say he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
