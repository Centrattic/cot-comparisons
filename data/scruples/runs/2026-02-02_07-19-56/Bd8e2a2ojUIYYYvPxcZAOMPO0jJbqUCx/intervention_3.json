I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and has been with a girl for a year. She's asking him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He refuses, and she's been cold to him since. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been working out for over six years, and it's a big part of his life. He mentions that his body might be what attracted her. He works long hours and only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl is getting vibes from people and her family that they don't see each other enough, so she's pushing for more time. But he's not willing to sacrifice his routine.\n\nHe argues that he's not asking her to give up her own hobbies, so it's unfair for her to expect him to. But maybe the issue is about balance in the relationship. The girl might feel neglected, especially if her family and friends are commenting on it. The guy's response is firm, which might be valid if his gym time is crucial to his well-being, but relationships do require compromise sometimes.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's reaction of being cold and saying she'll stop caring could be an overreaction. However, if he's not open to any flexibility, that could be a problem. The key is whether he's being unreasonable. He's not skipping unless necessary, which he's communicated. But maybe the girl feels like he's not making an effort. The fact that he sees her only once a week might not be enough for her, and he's not willing to adjust.\n\nBut then again, if he's clear about his priorities and she's not happy with that, maybe it's not his fault. The question is if he's wrong for not changing his routine. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his needs. But maybe he could find other ways to spend time with her without skipping the gym. However, he mentions that after the gym he's too tired, so maybe there's no other time.\n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his health and happiness. On the other, relationships require mutual effort. If she's feeling neglected and he's not making an effort, that's a problem. But if his routine is non-negotiable, maybe the issue is with her expectations. The answer might depend on cultural norms or common Reddit opinions. From the user's initial thought, they think the author is wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
