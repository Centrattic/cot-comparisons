I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The guy has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years. It's a big part of his life, his main hobby, and he's even mentioned that his body attracted her. He works long hours, and after the gym, he's tired and watches Netflix. They hang out every Friday or Saturday night.\n\nThe girl is getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, so she wants him to see her more. She asks him to skip the gym once a week. He refuses, and she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder and saying things like \"I see where your priorities are.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his priorities. He's clear that the gym is a huge part of his routine and happiness. He's even willing to compromise if it's occasionally, but not weekly. He's also consistent with their meetups (every Friday or Saturday), so maybe she feels it's not enough. But he's not cutting the time entirely; he's just maintaining his schedule.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. If she feels neglected, maybe he should consider adjusting his routine a bit. But he's been clear about his boundaries. He's not making her skip her activities, which is a fair point. It's about mutual respect. \n\nBut is his refusal the problem? If she's not happy with the current arrangement, maybe they need to talk more about how to balance both their needs. However, he's not the one violating his own boundaries here. He's being consistent, and she's reacting negatively to his truth. So maybe she's overreacting, and he's not in the wrong.\n\nWait, but relationships do require flexibility. If they've been together a year, maybe there's an expectation of more time. But he's already making time on the weekends. Maybe she wants more. But he's not in the wrong for not changing a long-standing habit unless he's willing. It's a balance between personal priorities and the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points: He's honest, but maybe she's not respecting his boundaries? Or is he not making enough effort? The answer might depend on whether the compromise is reasonable. Since he's not skipping other things, and he's already meeting her regularly, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the relationship is supposed to be a priority, maybe skipping once a week isn't too much. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the answer here is that he's not in the wrong because he's being honest and she's not respecting his boundaries by being upset. So answer B.\n"
