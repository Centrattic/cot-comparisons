I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a significant part of their life. They've been seeing a girl for a year, and she's upset because she feels they don't see each other enough. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her, but he refused, and now she's upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that working out is his main hobby, brings him happiness, and he's consistent with it. He mentions he's been doing it for 6.5 years, which shows it's a long-standing habit. He also says he only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights weekly. The girl is getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, implying she feels the relationship isn't getting enough attention or priority.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not asking her to give up her weekly activities, so he shouldn't have to. But the girl might feel that her need for more attention is being neglected. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author didn't skip the gym before, but now the girl feels it's a priority issue. Maybe the author could have suggested alternative ways to spend time together without skipping the gym entirely, like shorter meetups or different days. However, the author clearly states he's not willing to skip one day a week.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that he's not unreasonable because the gym is important to him, and he's consistent in seeing her once a week. The girl, on the other hand, might feel her emotional needs aren't being met. Relationships require compromise, but it's also important for both parties to respect each other's priorities. The author isn't necessarily wrong if he's clear about his boundaries, but maybe he could have been more flexible. However, the girl's reaction of being \"a dick\" and \"ice cold\" seems harsh if he's already making time for her weekly. The author might not be in the wrong if he's honest about his priorities and the girl is overreacting. But if the girl feels neglected, maybe the author didn't consider her perspective enough. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer probably depends on whether the author is willing to meet halfway or find other solutions. Since the author is firm and the girl is reacting negatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
