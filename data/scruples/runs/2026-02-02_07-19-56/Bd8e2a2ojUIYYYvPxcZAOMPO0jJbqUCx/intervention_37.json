I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his life. He's been in a relationship with this girl for a year, and she's asking him to skip the gym one day a week so they can spend more time together. But he says no, and now she's upset with him, even saying things like \"I see where my priorities are.\" The author doesn't think he's being unreasonable because he's told her he wouldn't ask her to skip her own hobby, and he sees the gym as his main hobby.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author's commitment to the gym is long-standing and important to him. He's been doing it for over six years, and it's a key part of his routine and happiness. He's also working long hours, so maybe his only downtime is the gym. But the girl is feeling neglected and wants more time with him. She's trying to adjust their schedule to spend time together once a week, which seems reasonable. He's not willing to make that change, which leads to conflict.\n\nNow, the author's argument is that he's not being unreasonable because he wouldn't expect her to skip her hobby. But is the gym his hobby, and is it fair that he's not willing to compromise? In relationships, communication and compromise are important. If the girl is feeling like she's not getting enough attention, and the only thing she's asking is for one day a week, maybe the author should be open to that. But then again, if the gym is a non-negotiable part of his life, maybe he's right to say no. \n\nBut here's the thing: relationships often require some level of compromise. If she's bringing up that she's getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, that suggests she's feeling some pressure or concern about the relationship's visibility or time. If he's not willing to adjust even once a week, that could indicate that his own needs are prioritized over hers. However, if the gym is a crucial part of his well-being, maybe it's not fair to expect him to give it up. \n\nAnother angle: the girl's reaction. She's been \"being a dick and ice cold\" for three days. That's harsh, especially if he's honest about his priorities. But maybe her frustration is due to feeling unimportant in his life. The author might feel wronged, but if he's not willing to make even a small adjustment, that could be a red flag for her. \n\nThe key question is whether one day a week is a reasonable ask. The author's hobby is the only one he has, but maybe the girl is asking for a small change in exchange for more time together. If he's not open to that, maybe he's not being flexible enough. However, if his well-being is tied to the gym, maybe he's justified. \n\nBut in relationships, both partners usually need to make sacrifices. If the author is unwilling to do so, even in a small way, that might make him the asshole. On the other hand, if the girl's expectations are unreasonable given his circumstances, maybe he's not. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up, but since the girl is asking for a minimal change (one day a week) and the author is not making any effort to accommodate her, he might be in the wrong. Especially since he's already set a precedent by not having other hobbies besides work and the gym. Maybe he should consider other ways to spend time together without sacrificing the gym, but if he's not willing to adjust his routine at all, that could be a problem.\n"
