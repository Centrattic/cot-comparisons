I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and refuses to skip a day to see his girlfriend more. She\u2019s upset now, giving him the cold shoulder, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy says that working out is his main hobby, he's been doing it for years, and it's part of his routine. He goes to the gym after work, which ends at 6 PM, and by the time he's done, it's 9 PM. He sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl feels she's getting weird vibes from people and her family, so she wants more time. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week. He says no, and she's upset.\n\nThe guy argues that he's not expecting her to skip her own hobbies, and he's consistent with his routine. He's not willing to change it. The girl is upset because she feels her needs aren't being met. \n\nNow, the question is whether the guy is in the wrong. Let's consider communication and compromise in relationships. Relationships require both parties to make some adjustments for each other. The guy has been in a routine for a long time, but the girl is asking for a small change. Is that unreasonable?\n\nHe's seeing her once a week already, and she wants more. Maybe the issue is that she feels neglected. But he's not willing to adjust his routine, even once a week. The gym is a big part of his life, but relationships also require flexibility. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his priorities. He's not forcing her to change her habits, but he's not willing to compromise on his own. However, relationships often involve mutual compromise. If he truly values the relationship, maybe he should consider adjusting, even slightly. \n\nBut then again, he's not in the wrong if he's honest about his limits. However, the way he handled it might be the issue. Maybe he could have found an alternative way to spend time together without skipping the gym. For example, maybe they could meet earlier in the week or find another activity that fits both their schedules. \n\nThe girl's reaction is also a factor. She's being cold and passive-aggressive, but that doesn't mean the guy is right. However, if he's not willing to budge at all, it might lead to further conflict. \n\nIn some perspectives, the guy is sticking to his priorities, which is okay, but maybe he's not considering the girl's emotional needs. The key is balance. If the relationship is important, both sides need to make some concessions. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But if he's not open to any compromise, even a small one like skipping a workout once a week, perhaps he's not considering her feelings enough. Therefore, he might be partly at fault. Answer A.\n"
