I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation. The author is a guy who's been seeing a girl for a year. He works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his life for over six years. She's asking him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refuses because it's his main hobby and routine, and now she's upset, even giving him the cold shoulder.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's stance is that his time at the gym is non-negotiable. He mentions that his body might have attracted her initially and that he's clear about not expecting her to give up her hobbies. He also spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl, on the other hand, feels like she's getting negative vibes from her family and others because they don't see enough of him, so she's trying to increase their time together. She's taken it personally when he said no, interpreting it as her not being a priority.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key. The author didn't skip the gym before she was part of his life, and she knows his routine. He's honest about his commitment to the gym. However, the girl's request is about wanting more time, which is a valid need in a relationship. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. \n\nHe argues that the gym is his main hobby and he'd never ask her to skip her weekly activities. But maybe the issue is that she feels her needs aren't being considered. If the relationship is about mutual respect and compromise, then maybe the author isn't wrong for not wanting to skip the gym, but perhaps he could have found a middle ground. However, the girl's reaction\u2014being \"cold\" and \"giving shit\"\u2014seems harsh. She's taking a hard line without considering his commitment and the fact that he's already spending time with her weekly. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for prioritizing his health and personal time, especially if he's clear about it from the start. She should have known this about him before getting involved. That said, relationships do require some compromise. But if he's not willing to adjust, and she's not willing to accept that, maybe the problem is on both sides. However, based on the information given, the girl's reaction seems excessive, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
