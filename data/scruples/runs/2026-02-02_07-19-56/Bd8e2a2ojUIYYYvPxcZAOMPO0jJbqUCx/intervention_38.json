I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for a long time. The girl he's seeing for a year wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refuses, and she's upset, saying she sees where his priorities are. The author is asking if he's the asshole for not giving in.\n\nFirst, let me consider both sides. The guy says that working out is his main hobby, he's been doing it for years, and it's part of his routine. He's also working long hours, so maybe he's tired. He meets with her on Friday or Saturday nights already. The girl feels she's getting negative vibes from people and her family about them not seeing enough, so she asks him to adjust his schedule. He says no, and she's been upset since.\n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he's not willing to compromise on a hobby that's important to him. He even mentions he'd never ask her to skip something she cares about. He values his routine and doesn't see why he should give up a day. On the other hand, the girl feels that he's not prioritizing their relationship enough. She might be feeling neglected or not valued enough, hence the comment about priorities.\n\nNow, communication is key here. Did he communicate his feelings effectively? He says he told her it's his only consistent hobby and he wouldn't skip unless necessary. Does that mean he explained the importance? Maybe, but maybe she feels that despite that, he's not making an effort for their relationship. But he's also meeting her once a week already. The question is whether expecting him to give up a daily routine for a weekly meetup is unreasonable.\n\nThe author's stance is that the girl is overreacting, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user might believe that not making time for the relationship is a problem. However, the guy has his own priorities. In relationships, compromise is important, but both parties need to find a balance. If the girl wants more time, maybe suggesting other ways to spend time together without sacrificing his gym day could be a solution. But if the guy is firm on not skipping, and the girl is upset because of that, maybe the issue is about expectations and whether the guy's refusal is justified.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the guy is being unreasonable. If he's not willing to make any adjustments, even if it's once a week, that could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship. But on the flip side, if this is a non-negotiable part of his life, maybe it's his right to not give it up. The girl might need to accept that or realize that their priorities are clashing. The guy might be in the wrong if he's not willing to find a middle ground, but if he's communicated his stance and the girl is still upset, perhaps the issue is her reaction.\n\nHmm. I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's clear about his priorities and the girl might need to adjust her expectations. But I'm not 100% sure. The question is whether expecting him to skip one day is unreasonable. Since he's only meeting her once a week already, maybe adding another day is a lot. But if the girl feels neglected, maybe the guy should be more accommodating. However, without more context, it's hard to say. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his priorities and the girl might need to accept that.\n"
