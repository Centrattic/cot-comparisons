I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of their life. They've been doing this for 6.5 years, and it's their main hobby. The girl they're seeing wants them to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. The author says no, and now she's been treating them poorly, saying things like \"I see where your priorities are\" and acting cold.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault (AITA). The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's consider the balance in the relationship. The girl is asking for more time, which is a valid request for many in a relationship. However, the author is clear that their gym routine is a non-negotiable part of their life. The key point here is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. \n\nThe author mentions that they make an exception for the girl on Friday or Saturday nights. So they are already sacrificing some time for her. The girl is asking for an additional day a week. The author argues that the gym is their only hobby and a major source of happiness, and they wouldn't expect the girl to cut down her own hobbies. This seems fair because relationships should involve mutual respect for each other's interests and boundaries. \n\nHowever, the girl's reaction could be seen as harsh. If she's feeling neglected, communication is key. If she's not willing to compromise but is upset when the author can't meet her demands, that's on her. The author isn't the one being unreasonable here. They communicated their stance clearly and have been consistent with their time allocation. \n\nAnother angle: the girl's family and friends are giving her \"weird vibes,\" which might indicate that they feel the relationship is taking up too much time. But that's not the author's responsibility. The author is clear about their commitment to their routine and has made exceptions already. The girl's response of giving the cold shoulder and making ultimatums without understanding the author's perspective could be the issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their priorities and have shown some flexibility. The girl's reaction is more about her own expectations not being met, not the author's actions being wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
