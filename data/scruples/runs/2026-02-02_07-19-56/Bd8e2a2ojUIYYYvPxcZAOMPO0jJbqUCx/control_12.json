I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy works out 6-7 days a week, which he says he's done for 6.5 years. It's his main hobby, and he even mentions that maybe the girl was attracted to him because of his physique. He works long hours, and after the gym, he's pretty much done for the day, just relaxing with his cat and Netflix. They see each other once a week, either Friday or Saturday nights.\n\nThe girl then mentions getting weird vibes from her family and others, implying he doesn't see her enough. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and now she's been acting cold and giving him the silent treatment and some harsh comments about priorities.\n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole here. Let's break this down. First, the guy has a long-standing habit that's important to him. He's transparent about it and even told her he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activities. The girl is asking for a change in his routine for their relationship. But when he says no, she's treating him poorly.\n\nNow, relationships often require compromise. But is skipping one day a week too much? The guy argues that his gym time is his only consistent hobby and he's tired after work. If he skips once a week, maybe he could do something else, but he doesn't mention other hobbies. However, the girl might feel neglected. But when she's upset and he stands by his decision, is he wrong?\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The guy made it clear he can't do it, and she might have tested his stance. But maybe the girl's approach wasn't the best too. She could have discussed other ways to spend more time together instead of demanding a change in his routine. However, the guy is not in the wrong for not compromising on something he's adamant about, especially since he's offered to be flexible if needed. The girl's reaction seems harsh if he's been clear from the start. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
