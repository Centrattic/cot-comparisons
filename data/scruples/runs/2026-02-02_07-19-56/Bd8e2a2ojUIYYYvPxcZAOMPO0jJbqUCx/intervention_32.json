I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not skipping the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl he's seeing. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for over six years, and it's a big part of his routine. He works long hours and then goes to the gym. The girl he's dating is upset because she feels he doesn't see her enough and wants him to skip the gym one day a week. He refuses, and now she's being cold to him.\n\nThe author argues that his gym time is his main hobby and a priority, and he even tells her he wouldn't expect her to give up her own weekly activities. He sees his refusal as reasonable because skipping the gym once a week is too much for him.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships require compromise. The girl is expressing her need for more connection, which is valid. The author is being honest about his limits, which is also important. But maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. He's been committed to the gym for a long time, but relationships also require flexibility. If she's feeling the connection is lacking, he might need to find a middle ground, like adjusting their meet-up times or finding other ways to spend time together without him giving up the gym entirely. However, he's not forcing her to do anything and is clear about his boundaries. \n\nHe might not be in the wrong for sticking to his priorities, but there's room for him to be more empathetic and explore alternative solutions. The fact that he's willing to compromise occasionally but not weekly shows he's trying. The girl's reaction is also extreme, as she's cutting him off for not meeting her demand. So, the author's stance is understandable, but maybe there's a balance that could be struck. However, since he's not forcing her to do anything and is honest, he might not be the asshole here.\n"
