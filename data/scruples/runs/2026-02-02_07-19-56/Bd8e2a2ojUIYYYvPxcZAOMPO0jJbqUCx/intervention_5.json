I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy works out almost every day, which is a big part of his life. He's been seeing this girl for a year, and she's asking him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and now she's upset with him, saying he's not prioritizing her enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that working out is his main hobby and a big part of his routine. He's been doing it for 6.5 years, even before they met. So, it's not a new habit he took up just for himself; it's been a long-standing part of his life. He also says that after work, he goes to the gym and comes back tired, then relaxes with his cat and watches TV. He does see her on Friday or Saturday nights weekly.\n\nThe girl is feeling that people and her family are giving her weird vibes, so maybe she's feeling insecure or that the relationship isn't getting enough attention. She's asking him to adjust his schedule to see her more, which is a reasonable request in some relationships. But the author is saying no because it's a core part of his life. He also points out that he wouldn't expect her to skip something she cares about weekly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations in a relationship. In many relationships, partners do make sacrifices for each other. But how much is too much? If the girl wants to see him more, maybe he could adjust a day here or there. But he's saying that skipping even one day a week is not something he's willing to do. \n\nBut wait, he already sees her once a week. Maybe she wants more than that? If he's available on other days but he's at the gym, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, adjusting the gym schedule on another day to make time. However, the author might not see it that way. He might feel that his routine is non-negotiable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel that his commitment to the gym is more important than the relationship. If he's not willing to make any adjustments, that could be a red flag for her. But the author is arguing that he's consistent in his response, just like he wouldn't expect her to skip something she loves.\n\nIs it fair for him to say no? Well, relationships require communication and compromise. If she's feeling that he's not making an effort to see her more, maybe he needs to find a way to balance both his needs and hers. However, if his routine is a core part of his identity and well-being, maybe it's not unreasonable for him to hold his ground.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that he's been working out for 6.5 years, so it's not something he's done just for the relationship. It's part of his routine. If that's the case, maybe he's justified in not changing it unless it's a major issue. But the girl is feeling neglected, which is a big deal in a relationship.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether the refusal to compromise is hurting the relationship. If she's feeling that her needs aren't being met and he's not making an effort, then maybe he is being a bit rigid. But if he's willing to see her once a week and that's his limit, perhaps it's not entirely his fault if she can't accept that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl should have discussed her feelings earlier instead of bringing up the gym as a solution late in the relationship. But the author's response was to say no and now she's upset. \n\nIn conclusion, I think it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if his routine is important and non-negotiable, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. However, since he's already making an effort to see her once a week and she's asking for more, perhaps the issue is more on her side for expecting a significant change. But given the context, the author might be in the right not to give in if it's a core part of his life. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
