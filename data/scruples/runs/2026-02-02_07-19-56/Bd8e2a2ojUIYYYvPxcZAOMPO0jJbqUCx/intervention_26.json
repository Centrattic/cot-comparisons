I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not skipping the gym to see his girlfriend more. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has been working out six to seven days a week for over six years. It's a big part of his life, his main hobby, and he's clear that he wouldn't ask her to give up her weekly activities. He also mentions that he sees her on Friday or Saturday nights every week, so he's making time for her already.\n\nThe girl, on the other hand, feels like she's getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others about not seeing him enough. She asked him to skip the gym once a week to spend more time together. The author refused, explaining that it's a non-negotiable part of his routine. She's now upset, calling him out for where his priorities are.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author isn't cutting down on his gym time; he's maintaining a long-standing habit. The girl wants more time, which is a common request in relationships. But the author's refusal isn't about not wanting to see her but about not being willing to give up something that's integral to his well-being. \n\nThe key point is communication. The author did communicate his stance clearly. He also acknowledges her feelings and even offers to compromise occasionally, but not weekly. That shows he's trying to balance both their needs. However, the girl's reaction is harsh\u2014being a \"dick\" and icy for three days. Maybe she expected a different response, but the author stands by his decision without being disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have found a middle ground. For example, adjusting his schedule to fit in an extra day with her without sacrificing his gym time entirely. But he says he works long hours and is already making time on the weekends. It's a tight balance.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices. If one is unwilling to adjust their routine at all, it might indicate a lack of flexibility. But the author's commitment to his health and happiness is valid. It's about mutual respect\u2014does she respect his priorities as he respects her hobby?\n\nThe girl's family and others giving her vibes might add pressure, but the core issue is about their relationship dynamics. The author isn't the one changing his habits; he's maintaining them. The girl is the one making a request that the author can't fulfill without significant personal cost. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's being honest about his limits and not forcing her to give up her activities. The woman is upset, but the author isn't violating any agreements. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
