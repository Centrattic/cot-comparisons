I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl he's dating. \n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his routine for 6.5 years. He mentions that she might have been attracted to him because of his physique. He works long hours and only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. When she asked him to skip the gym, he said no, and now she's upset.\n\nThe key points here are about priorities and expectations in a relationship. The author is clear that the gym is his main hobby and a significant part of his routine. He also states that he's communicated this to her and even acknowledged that if she had something important weekly, he wouldn't expect her to skip it. But she's disappointed because he's not willing to change his routine for her. \n\nNow, is he wrong? Well, relationships require compromise from both sides. If she asked for a weekly change and he's standing by his commitment, maybe he's being consistent with his values. But maybe he could have found a middle ground. However, he didn't force her to do anything and communicated his stance. On her part, her reaction seems harsh. She might need to understand his boundaries or realize that this is a non-negotiable part of his life. \n\nOn the other hand, if she genuinely feels neglected, there could be deeper issues. But the problem here is about one specific request. Since he's clear about his priorities and she's not respecting them, maybe she's the one who needs to adjust. The author might not be in the wrong for sticking to his routine, especially if he's given her his time on the nights he's available. The key is mutual respect for each other's priorities. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
