I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his life for years. He's been dating a girl for about a year, and she's upset because he won't skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. She's now been distant and critical, saying she sees where his priorities are.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say no. The author argues that working out is his main hobby, he's clear about it, and he even said he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly activities. He feels it's unreasonable to expect him to give up a weekly gym day. The girl, on the other hand, feels neglected and that her needs aren't being considered.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, he's being consistent about his priorities. He's been open about his routine and hasn't made exceptions before. The fact that she's only coming up with this now after a year might suggest that maybe she's not fully considered his commitment to the gym. But relationships do require mutual adjustment. The author isn't willing to change his routine, which is a significant part of his life, but maybe he's not considering how his refusal affects the relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl wants more time with him. It's reasonable for her to express that desire. However, her reaction being icy and confrontational might not be the healthiest way to handle it. But the core issue is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating her request. If the relationship requires some level of compromise, and the author isn't willing to make any, that could be a problem. However, if the author has made it clear that his gym time is non-negotiable, and he's not the one initiating more time, maybe it's a matter of differing priorities.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to find a balance. The author isn't skipping the gym for her, but they do already spend time together on the weekends. The girl's asking for an additional day. The author might feel that's too much, but maybe the girl feels like the existing time isn't enough. The author's refusal isn't malicious, but it could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship enough. However, if the author is clear about his boundaries and the girl is not respecting them, that's on her. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the author has been consistent, explained his reasons, and the girl is now being harsh for the refusal, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's not obligated to change a core part of his life unless both parties agree. The girl's reaction is more about how she's handling the situation rather than the author's refusal. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
