I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and refuses to skip even one day for his girlfriend. She's upset because she feels he's not prioritizing her enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been lifting for a long time, and it's a big part of his life. He mentions that his body might be what attracted her initially. He does see her every Friday or Saturday night. The problem is when she asks him to skip the gym one day a week, and he says no, which leads to her being upset.\n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he's sticking to his routine and hobby. He's not expecting her to do the same. He even says he can understand occasional sacrifices but not weekly. That seems reasonable. But on the other hand, the girlfriend feels neglected. She's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family, which might mean others perceive their time together as insufficient.\n\nNow, communication is key in relationships. The guy told her upfront that he wouldn't skip, and she's reacting negatively. But maybe he could have tried to find a middle ground. Like, maybe they can do something together on a gym day, or adjust other parts of their schedule to spend more time together without him skipping the gym. However, he doesn't mention trying alternatives. He just says no, and she's taking it as a lack of priority.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, if the relationship requires mutual effort, maybe he should be willing to make some adjustments. But it's also about personal boundaries. If his main hobby is the gym and he's already giving her regular time, perhaps he's not wrong. The problem might be that the relationship isn't balanced enough for her. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is extreme. Calling him an asshole and being cold for three days over one refusal might be overreacting. However, her feelings about not being prioritized are valid. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonably inconsiderate.\n\nI think the guy has a point in that he's not in the wrong for maintaining his routines, especially since he's already making time for her. But he might need to communicate better and find a compromise. However, based on the information given, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit on the fence. If he's completely unwilling to adjust even a little, that could be an issue. But he's allowing for occasional flexibility, just not weekly. So maybe he's in the right.\n"
