I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more. \n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a significant commitment. He mentions that this routine has been part of his life for 6.5 years, even before the relationship started. His job is demanding, working long hours, and after the gym, he's exhausted. The only time they spend together is on Friday or Saturday nights. The girlfriend is upset because she's feeling neglected and wants more time, suggesting he skip a gym day.\n\nThe author argues that his gym routine is his main hobby and a key part of his happiness. He's consistent and only skips when necessary. He also acknowledges that he wouldn't expect her to skip something she's passionate about weekly. He's firm in his refusal, which has caused tension between them.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: relationships require compromise. The girlfriend is expressing her need for more attention, which is a valid concern. The author is prioritizing his personal well-being and habits, which is also reasonable. However, the way he responded might be the issue. Instead of being open to finding a middle ground, he's completely closed off. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and flexibility. If the author is unwilling to make any adjustments, even a small one like choosing a different day or finding another way to spend time together, that could be seen as inflexible. The girlfriend's reaction is negative, but the author's refusal without considering alternatives might contribute to the conflict. \n\nHowever, the author also has valid points about his own needs and boundaries. It's a balance between respecting each other's priorities. So, it's not entirely black and white. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the author is completely unwilling to compromise at all, that could be seen as a problem. On the other hand, if he's justified in his stance, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nIn many relationships, expecting some level of compromise is normal. The fact that the girlfriend is asking for one day a week and the author is refusing entirely might lead others to think he's not making an effort. The author's argument that it's his only hobby and he's tired after the gym is understandable, but maybe there's a way to adjust schedules or find other times. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong if he's clear about his boundaries, but the situation highlights a need for communication and compromise. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are being ignored, the author might be at fault. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is open to any form of compromise. Since he's stated he's never expected her to skip something she cares about, but he's not willing to do the same, that's a discrepancy. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because he's not being flexible, even if his reasons are valid. But I'm a bit torn.\n"
