I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for 6.5 years. They've been seeing a girl for about a year, and she's asked him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and now she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder and making comments about his priorities.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author's gym routine is a significant part of his life, both as a hobby and a habit. He mentions that it's the only thing he does consistently besides work, which is 8:30 am to 6 pm Monday-Saturday, with normal 9-5 hours Monday-Friday. So, after work, he goes to the gym, which takes up his evenings. On the days he works, he's probably exhausted and then goes to the gym, ending up home by 8:30-9 pm. He does see her on Friday or Saturday nights. \n\nThe girl is feeling that the author isn't seeing her enough and wants more time, so she suggests he skip the gym once a week. The author declines, explaining that he wouldn't ask her to give up her weekly commitments. The girl is now upset, feeling that her priorities are not important enough. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's committed to his health and fitness, which is a long-standing part of his life. He's made it clear that this is important to him and that he's not willing to compromise on it. He's also consistent in seeing her on specific nights. He might believe that he's being honest and that his hobby is non-negotiable. \n\nFrom the girl's perspective: She feels that her desire for more time with him is not being prioritized. She might feel that the gym is a hindrance to their relationship and that he's not willing to make any sacrifices for her. Her reaction could be because she feels undervalued or that her needs aren't being met. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual expectations and communication. The author states that he has been seeing her for a year, so they should have a good understanding of each other's priorities. He mentions that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly activities, implying that he respects her commitments. However, when she asked him to do the same, he refused. \n\nIs this a matter of fairness? The author isn't in the wrong if both parties had an understanding that his gym routine is non-negotiable. However, if the girl's needs for more time are causing her distress and he's not willing to adjust in any way, that could be a point of contention. \n\nThe author's refusal is based on his own priorities and the fact that the gym is a significant part of his identity and well-being. It's not unreasonable for him to hold onto that, especially since he's been doing it for years. However, relationships require compromise. If the girl feels that her needs are not being met, the author might need to find other ways to spend time with her without sacrificing his routine. \n\nBut the author is not entirely wrong for saying no. He's being honest about his limits. The issue might be that the girl wasn't prepared for his refusal and is now reacting negatively. The author's mistake could be not anticipating the emotional impact of his refusal or not addressing her underlying feelings of not seeing enough. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym if he's communicated his priorities clearly and consistently. However, the problem might be more about how the girl is reacting rather than the refusal itself. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
