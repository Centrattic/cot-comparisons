I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a guy who works out 6-7 days a week, which he's done for 6.5 years. He's been in a relationship for about a year. The girl mentioned getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others about not seeing him enough, then asks him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He refuses, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He sees working out as his main hobby and a big part of his routine. He's been clear that he doesn't skip unless necessary. He also mentions he's understanding if she wanted him to skip occasionally but not weekly. He's not asking her to sacrifice her own hobbies, so he feels justified in his stance.\n\nThe girl's side: She's asking for more quality time. If she's feeling neglected or her family is giving her vibes, it's reasonable for her to want more time with him. Her reaction is negative, but maybe she's feeling hurt or unimportant. The problem is communication here. Maybe she wanted a compromise or a different solution, but when he refused, she lashed out.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require balance and compromise. While his gym routine is important, her request is about their relationship time. If she's bringing up the issue of not seeing enough, it's a valid concern. Refusing without finding a middle ground could be seen as not valuing her. However, he's also clear about his priorities and isn't forcing her to skip her own activities. \n\nHe could be in the right if he's honest about his commitment to the gym and she needs to adjust expectations. But if the issue is that he's unwilling to make any sacrifice, even a small one, that might be the problem. Maybe he didn't consider other ways to spend time with her without skipping the gym, like earlier in the day or on different days. \n\nHer reaction is harsh, but her feelings are real. He didn't address her emotional needs, just stuck to his routine. So maybe he's not wrong, but perhaps there's room for both to compromise. Since he's not willing to skip the gym, but she wants more time, maybe they need to find another solution. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf he's honest about his limitations and she's not respecting that, then he's not in the wrong. But if the issue is that he's not making any effort to meet her halfway, then maybe he is. The key is whether his refusal is reasonable given the circumstances. Since he's already making time on Friday/Saturday, maybe she's expecting more. But he's not wrong for not wanting to skip a daily routine for her. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's clear, and she's not respecting his boundaries. However, his lack of compromise might be an issue. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the relationship's overall health. If he's honest and she's overreacting, maybe he's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
