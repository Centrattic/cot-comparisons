I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with the girl he's seeing. \n\nFirst, looking at the background info: The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years. It's his main hobby, he loves it, and it's a significant part of his routine. He works long hours and only hangs out with her on Friday or Saturday nights. When the girl asks him to skip the gym one day a week, he says no, and she's been upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about priorities and communication. The author is clear that the gym is important to him, and he mentions that he even told the girl he wouldn't expect her to give up something she cares about. He's consistent in his own habits and is honest about his boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels like she's getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, which makes her want to see him more. Her request is to adjust his schedule to see her more often. But when he refuses, she's been acting cold towards him, implying that he's choosing his gym over her.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: It's about mutual respect and understanding. He's communicating his boundaries, which is fair. He's not asking her to change her habits, yet she's asking him to. However, relationships do require some compromise. The question is whether refusing to skip the gym once a week is unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The author isn't being unreasonable for sticking to his own priorities. The girl's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for being honest. He's also been consistent with their time together (every Friday or Saturday). So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
