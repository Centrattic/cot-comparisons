I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is wrong. The scenario is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week, and the girl he's seeing wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He said no, and she's been upset ever since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been into the gym for over six years, and it's a big part of his routine and happiness. He mentions that it's his main hobby and that he only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. He also states he wouldn't ask her to skip her weekly hobby. So, he's being consistent in his stance.\n\nOn her side, she's feeling neglected and wants more time together. She brought up the issue because she's getting \"weird vibes\" from others and her family. Her request is to skip one day a week, which seems reasonable from her perspective. But the guy refuses, which makes her upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. He's honest about his priorities and explains why he can't skip the gym. He's not asking her to change her habits, showing consideration. However, she's reacting negatively by \"icing him out\" and being rude, which isn't healthy.\n\nBut is he wrong for not changing his routine? If the relationship is supposed to be balanced, neither should have to completely sacrifice their hobbies. However, she's asking for a small adjustment (one day a week) that he's unwilling to make. But he's also not cutting back on other activities, just the gym. He's making time to see her once a week, but maybe she wants more. \n\nThe problem might be in the reaction of the girl, but the question is about the guy. He's being honest and sticking to his values. He's not forcing her to do anything, and he's clear about his boundaries. So, I think he's not in the wrong. The issue is more about the girl's reaction and maybe the lack of compromise. But the guy isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
