I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym weekly to spend more time with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has been working out regularly for over six years and mentions it's a big part of his routine and happiness. He works long hours and only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl is upset about \"weird vibes\" from her family and people around her, leading her to ask him to skip the gym. \n\nThe author says he's not willing to cut back on his gym time, which is his main hobby. He also mentions he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly activities. Now, she's been cold towards him.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal is unreasonable. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and balance. The girl wants more time together, which is valid, but the author's commitment to his routine is also understandable. However, relationships often require compromise. If the girl feels neglected, it's her right to express that. But the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. He's not forcing her to see him; he's choosing his time for himself. She's reacting negatively to his refusal, but he's not obligated to change his habits unless they're harmful. \n\nThe girl's family and friends might be influencing her, but the author isn't responsible for her social pressures. He's being honest about his priorities. If the relationship can't accommodate each other's needs, that's a mutual issue. But the author isn't doing anything wrong by sticking to his commitments. So, the answer is B.\n"
