I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for over six years. The girl he's seeing for a year now wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He declined, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: working out is his main hobby, it's important to him, and he's consistent with it. He's only hanging out with her on Friday or Saturday nights each week. He mentions that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip something she cares about weekly, so he's consistent in that logic. He's not willing to change his routine, and he thinks she's overreacting by giving him the cold shoulder and being rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels like she's getting negative vibes from people and her family, implying that there's some social pressure or concern about their relationship. She wants more time with him, which is a valid desire. But the author's response was to say no, which she took as a rejection. The fact that he's been working out long before their relationship might be a point here. Maybe she expected some compromise or adjustment from him as part of being in a relationship.\n\nNow, in relationships, mutual effort and compromise are usually important. If one person's hobbies take up a significant amount of time, it's reasonable for the other to want some adjustments. However, the author isn't willing to give up a daily routine that's been part of his life for years. The girl, on the other hand, is using social pressure (\"weird vibes from people and her family\") to push for more time together.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might not be in the wrong if he's clear about his non-negotiables. But maybe the girl's expectations weren't discussed earlier. If the author's gym time is non-negotiable and he's only meeting her once a week, that might be a problem in the relationship. However, the way she reacted (being cold, calling him an asshole) isn't healthy either. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's consistent in his stance and that he's not asking her to change her habits. But relationships often require flexibility. If the girl felt that skipping the gym was a small request, and the author refused, maybe she's feeling undervalued. The author's response might be justified if he's not willing to make changes that others might expect in a relationship. But if the relationship is supposed to be balanced, maybe he's not contributing equally.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's clear about his priorities and communicates them. However, the relationship might be imbalanced if the girl's needs aren't being met. The question is whether refusing to adjust his routine is fair. If the author's response is firm and he's not willing to compromise at all, that could be an issue. But he mentions he could see skipping occasionally, not weekly. The girl's reaction might be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship, but the author isn't the one in the wrong here. He's sticking to his boundaries, and the girl's expectations might not align with reality. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
