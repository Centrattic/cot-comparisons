I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not skipping the gym to see the girl more. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for over six years, which is a significant commitment. The girl in the situation asked him to skip one day a week so they can spend more time together, but he refused. Now she's upset and acting cold towards him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's justification is that working out is his main hobby, a major part of his routine, and something he's passionate about. He mentions that he doesn't expect her to skip her own weekly commitments, which shows a level of fairness. He also explains that he's been consistent with their weekly meetups on Friday or Saturday nights. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl is feeling neglected based on feedback from her family and others. Her request for more time might stem from a desire for a closer relationship. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his personal habits over the relationship, which might be hurtful. However, the author's stance isn't unreasonable since he's made it clear that his gym routine is non-negotiable.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author might be in the right if maintaining his health and routine is important to him, but the issue is whether he's meeting her needs. The girl's reaction is harsh, but the author's response is honest about his limitations. \n\nIt's a balance between personal priorities and relationship needs. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not changing his routine, but maybe he could have found a middle ground, like adjusting other parts of his schedule to spend more time with her without sacrificing the gym entirely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he's communicated his position and the girl is overreacting, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But if the relationship requires compromise, maybe he should have been more flexible. \n\nI need to decide if his refusal is unreasonable. Since he's been consistent, it's part of his identity, and he's not making her do anything, it's a matter of personal choice. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
