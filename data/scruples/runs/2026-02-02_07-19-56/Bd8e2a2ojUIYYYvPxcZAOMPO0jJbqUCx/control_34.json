I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his routine and identity. He's been in a relationship for a year, and the girl is saying she's getting weird vibes from her family and friends because he doesn't see her enough. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refuses, and she starts being cold and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy argues that working out is his main hobby, something he's done for years, and it's part of his happiness. He mentions he's willing to compromise occasionally but not weekly. The girl, on the other hand, wants more time with him and feels her request is reasonable. She's taking it personally, interpreting his refusal as a lack of priority for their relationship.\n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, relationships often require compromise from both sides. The girl's request is about spending more time together, which is a common issue in relationships. The guy is saying that his personal commitment to the gym is non-negotiable. But maybe he's not considering that her feeling neglected is significant. He does mention he spends time with her every Friday or Saturday night, so he's not completely unavailable. However, the girl might feel that even that isn't enough, especially if her family and friends are pointing it out.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy has a valid point about his own needs. If he gives up something important to him, it could affect his happiness. But relationships are about balance. If the girl is feeling neglected, the guy should be open to finding a middle ground. The problem might be that he's being too rigid. He's not wrong for having his own priorities, but he might not be wrong if he's not willing to adjust. However, the way the girl is reacting is also extreme, but her feelings are valid if she's feeling neglected.\n\nI think the key here is whether he's being unreasonable by refusing a weekly change. If he can't adjust even once a week, maybe it's a sign that their lifestyles aren't compatible. But he's not entirely in the wrong either. It's a mutual issue. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because he's clear about his boundaries and he's trying to meet in other ways. But maybe there's room for him to reconsider. However, based on the information given, he's not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
