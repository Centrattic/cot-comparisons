I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out almost every day and a girl who wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and she's upset, but he thinks he's right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been working out for over six years, which is a long time. It's his main hobby, and he mentions that it's important to him. He also has a busy work schedule, working early mornings to late afternoons, and then goes to the gym. He spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights. When she asks him to skip the gym one day a week, he says no, and she's been acting cold.\n\nHe argues that he's consistent in his workouts and that he even told her he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activities. He's okay with occasional skips but not a weekly one. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not complying with her request.\n\nFrom his perspective, he's being honest about his priorities. He's not making excuses; he's straightforward. He's also consistent in his behavior. On the other hand, she's feeling neglected and wants more time with him. But is her reaction justified?\n\nHe's not refusing to make any time; he's already seeing her weekly. Maybe she wants more, but he's not willing to compromise his routine. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. For someone who works out daily, skipping once a week could be significant. If that's his main hobby, giving up a weekly session might be a big deal. \n\nAlso, he mentions that she might have already known he wouldn't skip, but still brought it up. Maybe she's testing his commitment or trying to push boundaries. His response is honest, and he's not being disrespectful. He's clear about his limits.\n\nShe's upset because he's prioritizing the gym over her. But if the gym is part of his identity and mental health, maybe it's not fair to expect him to give it up. Relationships require compromise, but both parties have needs. However, she's been with him for a year, so she should have known about his habits. If she's now feeling like she's not a priority, maybe there's a deeper issue about communication or expectations.\n\nIs the author wrong? If he's not willing to adjust, but the relationship isn't meeting her needs, then maybe he's not in the wrong for being honest. But if the relationship requires some compromise, maybe there's room for negotiation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for saying no. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values. In some views, prioritizing personal health is okay. In others, relationship time is paramount.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's being honest and consistent. The girl might need to communicate better or realize that his routine is important. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
