I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that he works out 6-7 days a week, which he's done for over six years. He's been seeing a girl for a year, and she's asked him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that working out is his main hobby, a big part of his routine and happiness. He mentions that his job is demanding (8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday), and by the time he's done with work and the gym, he's too tired. He's only seeing her on Friday or Saturday nights. He also points out that he told her he wouldn't expect her to give up her own hobbies weekly.\n\nThe girl's perspective is that she's feeling neglected, getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, so she wants more time with him. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week. However, he says she probably knew he wouldn't do it but asked anyway. Now she's treating him coldly and talking about his priorities.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is balance in the relationship. The author is clear about his commitment to the gym, which is important to him. But relationships require mutual effort and compromise. The girl's request is to have more time together, which is a valid need. The author is firm in his refusal, which might be seen as not being flexible enough. However, he's not refusing to make any effort\u2014maybe he could adjust in other ways, but he's not willing to change his weekly routine.\n\nIs refusing one day a week unreasonable? If the girl wants more time, maybe there are other ways to spend time together without him skipping the gym. But she specifically asked for this, so maybe she thinks that's the only way. The author is being honest about his priorities, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he's handling it might be part of the problem. Communication is key here. He could suggest other ways to spend time together or adjust their current plans.\n\nThe girl's reaction is also a factor. Being \"a dick\" and \"ice cold\" is not a healthy response, but her feelings of not being prioritized might stem from real concerns. The author might need to explore other compromises or check if there's a middle ground. However, he's not wrong for having his own priorities and not giving up something integral to his well-being. The question is whether his refusal is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to find a balance. If the girl's need for more time is a significant issue, it might be a deeper problem than just the gym. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to skip, but maybe he could approach the situation differently. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether the situation could be improved. Based on the information, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his priorities and not compromising on something important to him. The girl's reaction is unhelpful, but that doesn't make him wrong.\n"
