I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his life and even something that attracted the girl. He works long hours and only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. She's upset because she feels they don't spend enough time together and wants him to skip the gym once a week. He refuses, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics here. Communication is key. The girl expressed her feelings about not seeing him enough, which is valid. The author's response was a firm no, which might seem insensitive, but he also mentions that he's willing to compromise for her if she had similar demands. \n\nIs refusing to compromise making him the asshole? Well, relationships require give and take. If both partners are making sacrifices, but in this case, the author is saying he won't budge, even a little. However, he does have a valid point that his gym routine is his main hobby and a source of happiness. \n\nBut the problem might be that he didn't offer an alternative solution. Maybe he could find another way to spend time with her without skipping the gym. However, he mentions that after the gym he's too tired. So maybe there's a time management issue. \n\nThe girl's reaction is also a factor. She's upset because she feels her needs aren't met. The author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her, but he's also clear about his priorities. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to feel valued. If one partner's needs are consistently not met, it can cause issues. The author isn't wrong for sticking to his priorities, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was upfront and explained his reasons, but she's not respecting his boundaries, maybe it's a mutual issue. However, the key point is that he didn't agree to her request, but he's not being unreasonable. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his commitments and even acknowledges her feelings. But there's room for improvement in finding solutions together. But according to the situation, he's not the asshole.\n"
