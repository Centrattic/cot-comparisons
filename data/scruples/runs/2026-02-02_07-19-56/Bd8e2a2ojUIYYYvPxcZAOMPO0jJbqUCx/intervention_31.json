I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author has been seeing a girl for about a year. He works out 6-7 days a week, which he's been doing for 6.5 years. He mentions that his body is what attracted her, but she won't admit it. His routine is pretty strict: works from 8:30-6 Monday-Saturday, goes to the gym, comes back tired, and then watches Netflix. He spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights every week.\n\nThe girl brings up that she's getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, implying they don't see enough of each other. She then asks him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. The author says he's known she wouldn't skip her own commitments, so he tells her no. Now she's been acting cold, saying she's moving on because of his priorities.\n\nThe author argues that working out is his main hobby and he doesn't expect her to give up her own weekly commitments. He's okay with doing it occasionally but not weekly. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication, priorities, and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is clear that his gym routine is essential to him, and he's been consistent with it. He also mentions that he's spending time with her on the weekends. The girl is asking for more time, which is reasonable, but the author is refusing to adjust his routine. The conflict arises from differing expectations of time and commitment.\n\nI need to consider if refusing to adjust one's schedule for a partner is unreasonable. The author is in a committed relationship (at least for a year), and relationships often require some compromise. However, the author is also clear that his gym time is non-negotiable, which he's communicated. The girl might feel that he's not making the effort to give her more attention, even if it's once a week. On the other hand, the author isn't expecting her to make similar sacrifices, which seems fair, but he might be in a position where his own needs are prioritized without considering hers.\n\nBut the problem here is that the girl is feeling neglected. The author spends his free time working out and then being tired, which leaves limited time for her. Even if he's not physically with her, maybe they could find other ways to spend time together. However, the author is not willing to adjust his routine. The question is whether this is a reasonable stance. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal needs with the relationship. The author might be right that he shouldn't have to sacrifice something he's passionate about unless there's a mutual agreement. But if the girl is feeling that her needs aren't being met, then the author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his own habits over the relationship. However, the author is also clear that he's spending time with her weekly, which might be sufficient for some people. It's possible that the girl's expectations are higher, leading to the conflict.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have discussed his gym routine's importance to him, and she might not have communicated how she feels about the time they spend together. However, the author did mention that he told her he wouldn't skip unless necessary, so maybe the communication was there. The girl's reaction could be a result of feeling unappreciated or not a priority.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the girl is feeling that her needs aren't met, and the author is not willing to make any adjustments, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if he's made it clear that his gym time is non-negotiable and he's providing his own time (weekend nights), then it's not entirely his fault. The girl might need to recognize that his routine is important and find other ways to connect. But if the relationship requires mutual compromise, then the author might be not considering her needs enough.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is unwilling to find any middle ground. If he's completely inflexible, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's already making time for her and she's not satisfied, then it's a two-way street. The author might not be in the wrong because he's clear about his boundaries, but the girl's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym. Considering that relationships require give and take, the author might be in the wrong if he's not making any effort to adjust. But if his routine is essential and he's not willing to budge, then it's his choice. But the girl's feelings are valid, so maybe the author is not entirely wrong, but maybe there's room for him to reconsider. Hmm.\n"
