I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not skipping the gym to see his girlfriend more. Hmm. First, I need to look at both sides.\n\nThe author works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his life for years. He mentions that his girlfriend might have been attracted to him because of his physique. He's clear that the gym is his main hobby and a key part of his routine. He's only hanging out with her on Friday or Saturday nights. When she asks him to skip the gym one day a week, he says no. She then becomes distant and critical, saying she sees his priorities.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for not complying. Well, he's being honest about his priorities. He's consistent in his routine and communicates that he can't skip. He also shows understanding by saying he's okay with skipping occasionally but not weekly. He's not asking her to sacrifice her own hobbies, which is fair. \n\nOn the other hand, she expressed a desire to spend more time together, which is valid. Maybe the issue is that she feels her needs aren't being met. But he's also not at fault for having his own priorities. Relationships require compromise, but he's made an effort to see her every week. If she's unhappy, maybe it's her responsibility to communicate better or find a middle ground. \n\nHe didn't act out of spite; he communicated his stance clearly. She's reacting poorly to his honesty, which isn't his fault. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
