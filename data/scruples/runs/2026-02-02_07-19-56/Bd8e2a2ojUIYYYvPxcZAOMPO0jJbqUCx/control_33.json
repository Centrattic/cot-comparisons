I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the guy works out 6-7 days a week and a girl he's been seeing for a year wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and she's been upset for three days.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author argues that the gym is his main hobby, part of his routine for years, and he's never expected her to change her habits. He sees his commitment to the gym as reasonable, and he's willing to meet her on Friday or Saturday. He also says he's not asking her to give up her weekly activities. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels he's not making enough time for her. She's been getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, which might mean there's some external pressure or her family is involved. She's asking for just one day a week, which seems like a small request, but the author is refusing. She's responding by cutting him off and being cold, which he perceives as unfair. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author isn't wrong for having his own priorities, but setting boundaries is important. However, the girl's request is also about wanting more time with him. The problem might be that the author hasn't offered alternative solutions. For example, maybe adjusting their current meet-up days, meeting for shorter periods, or finding other ways to spend time without skipping the gym entirely. \n\nThe author mentions he meets her on Friday or Saturday. If she wants more time, maybe suggesting an additional meet-up on another day without skipping the gym? Or maybe she wants more quality time than just one night a week. The author might not realize that his refusal is affecting her emotionally, leading to her icy response. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's clear that the gym is his main hobby and he's communicated that. He also says he's flexible for occasional changes but not weekly. He's not expecting her to give up her own time. So he's consistent in his stance. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, both partners need to adapt. If the girl feels neglected, there might be a deeper issue about the balance of time. The author isn't wrong in not wanting to skip the gym, but maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's honest about his priorities and not forcing her to change hers, maybe he's not at fault. The girl's reaction could be unreasonable, but the author's refusal isn't inherently wrong either. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and negotiation. The author's answer doesn't seem to be in the wrong because he's not violating any agreement. However, there's a need for better communication. But based on the information given, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
