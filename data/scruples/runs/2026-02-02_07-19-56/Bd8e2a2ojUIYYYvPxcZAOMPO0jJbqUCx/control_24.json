I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy works out 6-7 days a week, which he's been doing for 6.5 years. He's been seeing this girl for a year, and she wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He declined, and now she's being cold and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main point is that the gym is his main hobby, a big part of his routine, and he's not willing to give up a day for the relationship. He also mentions he's only seen her on Friday or Saturday nights weekly, which he says is consistent. She, on the other hand, feels like he's not prioritizing her enough based on \"weird vibes\" from others and her family. She expected him to compromise, but he didn't. Now she's upset and acting distant.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations in a relationship. Relationships require compromise from both sides. If she's feeling neglected, maybe she should have expressed that earlier, but he also needs to be aware that his partner's feelings matter. However, the author is clear that he values his routine and isn't willing to change it. Is that unreasonable?\n\nHe says he told her he wouldn't ask her to skip her weekly hobby. So he's setting boundaries, which is fair. But relationships involve balancing individual needs. If she's suggesting a weekly change, maybe there's an assumption that his priority should shift towards her. But if he's not okay with that, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's not making any effort to meet her halfway, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, he does go to her Friday or Saturday nights. Is that enough? Maybe she expected more. But he's working long hours, so time is limited. The issue here is whether refusing to skip the gym once a week is unreasonable. Since it's a core part of his life and he's not asking her to give up her time, he might not be wrong. But if the relationship requires more time, maybe he should be more flexible. However, he's not in the wrong if he's honest about his limits. She's reacting poorly, but he's also not necessarily wrong for not compromising on his main hobby. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
