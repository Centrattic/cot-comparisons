I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and a girl he's dating wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that working out is his main hobby and has been part of his routine for years, even before the relationship. He works long hours and by the time he gets home, he's tired and watches Netflix. The girl says she's getting vibes from her family and others about not seeing him enough, so she wants him to skip the gym once a week. He told her no, and she's been upset.\n\nThe key points here are about priorities and compromise in a relationship. The author believes his time at the gym is important and non-negotiable, while the girl feels neglected and wants more time together. The author argues that he's not asking her to give up her own hobbies, which is fair. But maybe the issue is that she feels her needs are being overlooked. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's request might be reasonable if she feels the relationship is suffering. However, the author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his hobby over the relationship. But then again, everyone has their own priorities, and it's about mutual understanding. \n\nThe girl's reaction of being cold and giving the middle finger might be immature, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. However, if the author is unwilling to make any adjustments, even a small one like skipping once a week, it could indicate that he's not prioritizing the relationship enough. \n\nThe author also mentions that he's making time to see her on Fridays or Saturdays, which is once a week. Maybe she wants more than that. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship requires some compromise, maybe he should be open to adjusting his routine a bit. However, he's clear that the gym is a significant part of his life, and he's not willing to change. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's communicated his stance and she's overreacting. However, relationships do require some flexibility. The answer might depend on whether the girl's request is reasonable and if the author is being rigid without considering her feelings. But given the information, the author explained his position, and the girl's reaction seems harsh. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because sometimes in relationships, both sides need to meet in the middle.\n"
