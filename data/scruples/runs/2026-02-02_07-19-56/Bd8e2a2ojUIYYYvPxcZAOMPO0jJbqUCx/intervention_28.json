I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and a girl he's been seeing for a year wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He declined, and now she's upset, calling him an asshole and acting cold. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy says that working out is his main hobby, he's done it for 6.5 years, and it's part of his routine. He's working long hours, and after the gym, he's too tired to do much else. They already spend time together on Friday or Saturday nights. He also mentions he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip something important for him, which he sees as mutual respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl is expressing that she's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family, which might suggest she's feeling insecure or that the relationship isn't getting enough attention. She asked him to adjust his routine for her, but he refused, and she's been upset since. The guy is now asking if he's the asshole for not compromising.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise in a relationship. In healthy relationships, both partners usually need to make adjustments. The guy might think he's being fair by not giving up a major part of his life, but the girl feels her needs aren't being met. However, if the existing time they spend together is sufficient, maybe she should consider other ways to address her feelings. But maybe she feels that one day a week is important for the relationship, and his refusal is a sign that he's prioritizing his routine over the relationship.\n\nThe guy's argument is that he's consistent in his routine and that he's not expecting her to give up her commitments. But relationships often require flexibility. If the girl is feeling neglected, even if they're seeing each other weekly, maybe the issue is about quality time or her perception of commitment. The guy might not see that his routine is causing her emotional distress, which could be his fault if he's not showing empathy towards her feelings.\n\nOn the flip side, if working out is a non-negotiable part of his life and he's already making time for her once a week, maybe he's not wrong for not wanting to change his entire routine. However, if the girl is feeling this strongly and the problem isn't just about time but about feeling valued, then maybe he could find a middle ground, like adjusting the day he works out to have more flexible time.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being reasonable in his stance and she's overreacting, then he's not the asshole. But if his refusal is dismissive of her needs without trying to find a solution, he might be. The fact that he's been in this routine for years and she's new to the equation complicates things. The girl's family and others making \"weird vibes\" might also indicate external pressures that the guy isn't aware of.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a toss-up. If the guy is firm in his position and the girl is reacting with anger and coldness, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's not willing to consider any compromise, even minor ones, then maybe he is. Since he says he could understand if she wanted occasional changes but not weekly, maybe he's being reasonable. However, the girl's feelings being hurt and her withdrawal might be her part as well. But I think the key is that he's not the one acting like an asshole here; he's standing by his values and she's upset, so he might not be in the wrong.\n"
