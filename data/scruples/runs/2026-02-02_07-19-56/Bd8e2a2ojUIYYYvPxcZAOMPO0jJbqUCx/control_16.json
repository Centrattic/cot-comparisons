I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and a girl he's been dating for a year wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and she's been acting cold. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says that working out is his main hobby, he's been doing it for years before the relationship, and it's important to him. He mentions that he does see her on Friday or Saturday nights weekly. He also states that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip something she cared about, which is a fair point. \n\nOn the other side, the girl feels she's getting weird vibes from others and her family, so she wants more time with him. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week, and when he refused, she's been acting cold. The author is frustrated that she's treating him like an asshole for not giving in.\n\nNow, am I supposed to evaluate if he's wrong? Well, in relationships, communication and compromise are key. The girl expressed her desire for more time, which is valid. The author's refusal might be because it's his personal time and a priority. However, not making any effort to adjust could be seen as not valuing her feelings. But the author is consistent in his routine and has other times to see her. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect. The author isn't willing to compromise on his gym time, which is understandable if it's a big part of his identity. But the girl's request is about quality time. The author didn't say he wouldn't make other sacrifices, just this one. However, she's upset because he's not giving in. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to skip the gym if it's a personal priority. However, if the relationship is causing strain because of this, maybe there's room for more discussion. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for saying no. The girl's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he communicated his boundaries and has a valid reason. The girl's response is harsh, but that's her responsibility. The author isn't obligated to change a long-standing habit unless both parties agree. So, he's not the asshole here.\n"
