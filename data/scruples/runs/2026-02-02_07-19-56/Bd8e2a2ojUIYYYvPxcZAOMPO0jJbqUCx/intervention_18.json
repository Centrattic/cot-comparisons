I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for six and a half years. It's a big part of his routine and happiness. He works long hours and only hangs out with her on Friday or Saturday nights. He says he's clear about not skipping the gym and that she's been upset since.\n\nThe girl wanted him to make time for her, which is a common relationship issue where partners want quality time. But the author's refusal is based on his commitment to his gym routine. The question is whether his refusal is reasonable or if he's neglecting her feelings.\n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground. The author is willing to skip occasionally, but not weekly. The girl wants weekly. Maybe the author is being firm, but is it fair? Also, the girl's reaction of being cold and distant might be a problem too. However, the user is asking specifically about the author's actions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the gym is his main hobby and important for his well-being. He's consistent in his routine. The girl is feeling neglected, which is valid. But is the author wrong to prioritize his own routine? Relationships often require compromise, so maybe the author didn't show enough flexibility. However, he did mention he wouldn't ask her to skip her own things, which is fair. \n\nIf the girl is feeling the gym is more important than her, that's a problem. But the author is clear about his limits. Maybe the issue is the lack of alternative solutions. Instead of skipping the gym, could they find another time to spend together? The author might be in the wrong if he's not open to creative solutions. But if there's no time, maybe he's justified. \n\nI think the key is whether he's being unreasonable. If the girl wanted more time, the author could adjust other parts of his schedule. But he hasn't mentioned trying that. He's stuck to his gym routine. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's honest about his priorities, but he might not be considering her feelings enough. However, the question is if he's the asshole. The answer depends on balance. Since he's honest and clear, and she's overreacting, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not trying to find a compromise, maybe he is. \n\nHmm. I think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because he's clear about his boundaries and the girl is overreacting. But some might argue he's not making enough effort. However, the main point is he's not willing to change a core part of his life unless she's willing to compromise. Since he's not forcing her to change, maybe it's fair. So B.\n"
