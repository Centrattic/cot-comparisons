I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by refusing to skip the gym one day a week for his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the background: The author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his life. He's been doing it for over six years and it's his main hobby. He works long hours, and after the gym, he's usually too tired to do much else. They see each other once a week on Friday or Saturday night.\n\nThe girlfriend started feeling neglected because people and her family mentioned she doesn't see him enough. She asked him to skip the gym once a week to spend more time together. The author refused, and now she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder and saying she sees where his priorities are.\n\nThe author argues that he's not being unreasonable because the gym is his main hobby and he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly activities. He's okay with occasionally missing a workout but not weekly. He's confused why she's treating him this way.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. On one hand, he has a valid reason. The gym is a significant part of his routine and happiness. He's already giving her time once a week. On the other hand, she's feeling neglected and is seeking more time together. The conflict is about balancing personal priorities versus a partner's needs.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could adjust his schedule slightly, like working out earlier or on different days to make space. But he mentions that after work, the gym is his only consistent activity. If he's already making time for her once a week, perhaps she's expecting more than he's willing or able to give. However, communication is key. He could have explained his perspective and maybe found a compromise, but he stood his ground, leading to her upset.\n\nBut is he wrong? The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. If he's not willing to adjust and she's feeling neglected, maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. However, people in relationships have boundaries. The key is whether the refusal was communicated respectfully and if there's a willingness to find a solution. The author seems to have told her upfront, but she might feel rejected. Still, expecting someone to give up a core part of their life for a relationship's frequency might be too much, especially if they're already making time. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. If he's not open to any compromise, maybe. But given the context, he might not be. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
