I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and is asked by his girlfriend to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He refuses, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been working out for 6.5 years, it's his main hobby, and he's clear that it's important to him. He mentions that he's happy with his routine and that he even told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own activities. He sees his time at the gym as non-negotiable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels like she's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family about their relationship, and she wants more time with him. Her request is to skip just one day a week. She might feel neglected or that her needs for attention aren't being met. However, she reacts negatively by being \"a dick\" and icy, which seems harsh, but maybe she's feeling unappreciated.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual expectations. The author is honest about his priorities and his unwillingness to compromise on his routine. He's also given her a reason\u2014his happiness and long-standing routine. The girl's request is understandable, but expecting someone to give up a significant part of their life for more time might not be reasonable, especially if the guy has made it clear that his routine is a priority.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. From an outsider's perspective, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his own interests. Relationships require compromise, but there's a limit to how much one person should adjust for another. The girl's reaction is more concerning because she's being hostile after a straightforward refusal. The author communicated his stance, and it's valid that he doesn't want to skip the gym. The issue might be more about the girl's expectations and how she's handling the situation.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not the Asshole) because the author is standing by his priorities and communicated clearly. The girl's reaction is unkind, but the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining his boundaries.\n"
