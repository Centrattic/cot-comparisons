I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with the girl. \n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a significant part of his routine and identity. He mentions that his physique might have been what initially attracted the girl. The gym is his main hobby, and he's been doing it for 6.5 years. He works long hours and only has time to see her on Friday or Saturday nights. \n\nThe girl expressed feeling she's getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others about not seeing him enough. She then asked him to skip the gym once a week. The author refused, explaining that he doesn't skip unless necessary. Now she's been distant and critical, saying she sees where his priorities are.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author clearly communicated his stance, explaining that the gym is a non-negotiable part of his life. He also acknowledged her perspective and even offered to make exceptions occasionally, but not weekly. The girl, on the other hand, might feel unappreciated or not a priority. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his needs and boundaries. He's not refusing to make any effort\u2014just a specific one that's a core part of his routine. The girl might need to evaluate whether this is a deal-breaker for her. The author isn't obligated to change who he is fundamentally for the relationship to work. However, if the girl's needs aren't being met, that's a valid issue for her to address. \n\nThe problem might be that the girl's request is a deal-breaker for her, and she's reacting poorly to his refusal. The author isn't being selfish if he's already making time to see her once a week. It's about balance and whether both parties can meet in the middle. Since the author isn't forcing her to stay, but she's choosing to be upset, the fault might not be on the author's side. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's being truthful about his priorities and has set clear boundaries. The issue may lie more with the girl's reaction and expectations.\n"
