I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for over six years. It's a big part of his routine and his only consistent hobby. He works long hours and only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. When she asks him to skip the gym one day for her, he says no, and she responds coldly.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being honest about his priorities. He emphasizes that he wouldn't ask her to skip something she cares about weekly. That seems reasonable. He's clear that he's not willing to compromise his routine, which is a valid stance if it's important to him.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected. She's expressing a desire for more time together, which is a common need in relationships. The problem arises when her request is denied, and she reacts negatively. But is the author wrong for not wanting to change his gym schedule? \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author is upfront about his non-negotiables, and he's not asking her to sacrifice her own hobbies. The issue might be about finding a middle ground. However, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining his boundaries. Relationships require compromise from both sides, and if the girlfriend can't accept his limits, that's her issue. The author isn't being selfish; he's being honest about his needs. The girlfriend's reaction is more concerning, but the question is about the author's actions. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
