I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for years. He's been in a relationship for a year, and the girl is upset because he won't skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He says he told her no, and she's been acting cold since. He argues that working out is his main hobby and he's consistent with it, and he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activities either. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that his workout routine is essential to him, and he's not willing to cut back even once a week. On the other hand, the girl feels that he's prioritizing his gym over her, leading to her feeling neglected and hence her cold reaction.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author mentions he told her he wouldn't skip the gym, and he stood by his decision. But he also acknowledges that she wanted to see him more, which is a valid desire. However, the fact that he's only seeing her on Friday or Saturday nights once a week might be a point. If their time together is limited, expecting her to adjust without any reciprocation might be an issue. But the author's argument is that his routine is non-negotiable, similar to how he'd respect her if she had something weekly she wouldn't skip.\n\nBut here's the thing: relationships often require some compromise. If the girl's family and friends are giving her weird vibes about the lack of time together, that might indicate that the current arrangement isn't meeting her needs. The author's refusal to adjust could be seen as not being willing to make an effort for her, which could be perceived as prioritizing his own time over the relationship. However, the author is also clear that he's not expecting her to give up her own commitments, which shows some level of respect.\n\nThe cold reaction from the girl is a problem. If she's been \"a dick and ice cold\" for three days, that's not healthy either. But the root of the issue is the initial request. The question is whether the author's refusal is reasonable. He's been clear about his commitment to the gym, and he's not in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, if the relationship requires some flexibility, maybe the author isn't considering the other side enough. But based on the information given, he's been honest and upfront, and the girl's reaction seems immature. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's standing by his priorities, which he's communicated clearly, and the issue lies more with the girl's response.\n"
