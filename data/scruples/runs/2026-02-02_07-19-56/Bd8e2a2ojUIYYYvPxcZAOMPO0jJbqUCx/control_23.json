I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with his girlfriend. The background is that he's been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years, which is a significant part of his life. The girl mentioned feeling distant and asked him to skip a day for her, but he refused, leading to her being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the gym is his main hobby, a key part of his routine, and his body might have even attracted her initially. He's consistent with his schedule, and he's willing to meet her weekly (Friday or Saturday). He also mentions that he wouldn't expect her to give up something she cares about, which shows some mutual respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels she's not getting enough attention and is trying to adjust the relationship's balance. Her reaction of being upset and cold could be seen as a reasonable emotional response to feeling neglected. However, the author is standing by his commitment to his gym routine, which he's maintained for years. \n\nI should consider whether the refusal is unfair. If the gym is a non-negotiable part of his life and he's meeting her weekly, maybe it's not unreasonable. However, in a relationship, compromise is essential. The girl's request is to adjust his schedule slightly to spend more time together. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to skip the gym, but maybe he could have found a middle ground, like adjusting the gym time or adding another day. But he states he won't skip, which is his right. The girl's reaction being \"a dick\" and cold is perhaps her issue, but the author isn't entirely wrong in saying no. \n\nIt's a matter of balancing personal commitments and relationship needs. Since the author is clear about his boundaries and hasn't violated any prior agreements, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The problem might be the girl's inability to handle the refusal, but the user is asking about the author's wrongness. So the answer is B (No).\n"
