I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more.\n\nFirst, the background: The author works out 6-7 days a week, a habit he's had for 6.5 years. His girlfriend wants him to skip the gym once a week to spend more time together. He refused, and she's been upset since. He argues that lifting is his main hobby, he works long hours, and that he wouldn't expect her to give up something weekly. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about relationship dynamics here. Communication is key. He mentions he's been seeing her for a year. If she's been feeling like he's not seeing her enough, maybe there's a deeper issue about balance in the relationship. He's clear about his priorities, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough.\n\nBut on the flip side, he's committed to a routine that's important to him. He's not cutting down his other activities, just maintaining his gym time. Is it fair for her to ask for a weekly change? He's willing to adjust occasionally but not weekly. That seems reasonable if it's a non-negotiable part of his life. However, in a relationship, both partners should consider each other's needs. If she's feeling neglected, maybe there's a need for more communication or compromise.\n\nHe did tell her he wouldn't expect her to give up her own habits, which is fair. But he might not have validated her feelings enough. She could feel that her needs aren't being prioritized. The fact that she's been acting cold for three days suggests she's hurt. The author's response might be seen as dismissive if he didn't address her emotional concerns beyond just the gym.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on perspective. He's not wrong for having his own priorities and not wanting to change them entirely. But maybe he could have been more empathetic and found a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because he should have been more flexible. If B (no), because he's standing by his own needs and communicated clearly.\n\nI think the key here is that while his stance is understandable, the way he handled it might have been too rigid without considering her feelings. But ultimately, he's not the asshole if he's honest about his limits. The relationship's health depends on mutual respect, and if she's unhappy with the current balance, maybe they need to talk more. But the initial question is about him being wrong. Since he's honest and clear, maybe B is the answer.\n"
