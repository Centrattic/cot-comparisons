I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of their life and routine. They've been in a relationship for a year, and the girl is feeling like she's not getting enough attention. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He said no, and now she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder and saying she's going to stop caring.\n\nThe author argues that working out is his main hobby, something he's done for years, and it's not just about his body, which she might have been attracted to. He also mentions that he's willing to compromise if it's occasional but can't drop it weekly. He's frustrated that she's treating him like an asshole for saying no.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The girl expressed her feelings and needs, which is valid. She wants more quality time, which is a common issue in relationships. The author's response was to say no, which is his right, but maybe the way he handled it could have been better. He could have tried to find a middle ground. For example, maybe adjusting the workout schedule slightly to accommodate her without skipping entirely. But he seems firm that he can't do it. However, his argument is that he's not asking her to give up her hobbies, which is fair.\n\nBut relationships require compromise from both sides. If the girl is feeling neglected, it's not just about the time he spends at the gym but also about how he's addressing her feelings. He could acknowledge her feelings and reassure her that he values the time they do spend together. Maybe they need to find other ways to increase time together, like during the days they already hang out (Friday/Saturday nights) or integrating her into his routine if possible. However, he doesn't seem to have offered alternatives, just a flat refusal.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's reaction might be over-the-top. Giving the cold shoulder and saying she'll stop caring could be a harsh response. But her feelings are valid if she feels he's prioritizing his hobby over their relationship. The key issue here is mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't wrong to have his boundaries, but maybe not considering her feelings enough. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since he didn't make any effort to find a solution and just refused, he might be in the wrong. But it's not black and white. Hmm. I think the answer might be A, he is in the wrong because he didn't try to meet her halfway, even if his stance is understandable. Relationships require both parties to adjust sometimes.\n"
