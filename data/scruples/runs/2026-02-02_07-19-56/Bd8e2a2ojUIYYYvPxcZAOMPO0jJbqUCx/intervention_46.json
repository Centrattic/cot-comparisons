I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out daily and a girl he's seeing wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He declined, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: he's been working out for years, it's his main hobby, and he's clear that he doesn't skip unless necessary. He even acknowledges that his physique might be what initially attracted her. He's willing to meet once a week (Friday or Saturday), and he's telling her he can't skip the gym. He also mentions he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly hobby. He's firm in his stance, not budging on skipping once a week.\n\nThe girl's side: she's feeling that she's not getting enough attention, mentions \"weird vibes\" from her family and others. She's asking for more time together. When he says no, she becomes distant and critical. She might be feeling undervalued or neglected. Her reaction could be from feeling like her needs aren't being met, even if her request is about his time.\n\nNow, analyzing the key points. The guy is consistent in his routine, and he's made it clear this is important to him. He's not asking her to sacrifice her own hobbies, only that she might be asking him to give up his main hobby. The problem is communication. He told her he wouldn't skip, but maybe he could have been more empathetic in his response. However, he's not wrong for having boundaries. On the other hand, the girl's reaction is harsh\u2014being cold and critical after a \"no\" might be unfair, but her feelings are valid if she feels neglected.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's clear about his priorities and stands by them without being disrespectful, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's not considering her needs or being dismissive, then maybe. However, he does acknowledge her intention to see him more and says it's not about priorities, which he's consistent about. The girl's reaction is more about her feelings, but her approach (being cold, critical) is unkind. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. Both need to make compromises. If he's unwilling to make any adjustments, that's a red flag. But he's already meeting her once a week and has a solid reason for not changing his routine. Maybe the issue is that she's not happy with the current arrangement, but his stance is reasonable if he's communicated it clearly. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but the situation is complex. However, the user initially thought he's in the wrong, but maybe they should consider his perspective more. The key is whether his refusal is justified given that he's consistent and clear, and she's not meeting his needs either by being harsh.\n"
