I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not skipping the gym one day a week to see his girlfriend more.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing it for a long time. It's his main hobby and he's been doing it before the relationship started. He says that his body might have attracted her in the first place. He works long hours and goes to the gym after work, then watches Netflix and goes to bed. They hang out every Friday or Saturday. The girl is upset because she's getting \"weird vibes\" from others and her family about not seeing him enough, so she asks him to skip gym one day. He says no because he can't skip unless he has to. Now she's been treating him coldly for three days, saying she sees where his priorities are.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to decide. Let me consider factors like communication, compromise, and mutual respect. The author mentions that he's consistent with his gym routine and it's important to him. He also says he's okay with her not skipping her own hobbies. The girl is asking for more time together, which is reasonable. But the author is unwilling to compromise on something he considers crucial. \n\nIs it fair for him to refuse if she wants more time? It depends on the balance. If they only hang out once a week, maybe the girl feels it's insufficient. The author is in a position where he's not willing to adjust his schedule, but he's expecting her to accept that. However, the girl's reaction might be a bit extreme, but maybe she's feeling neglected. The key point is whether his refusal is unreasonable. He has been consistent for 6.5 years, so changing once a week might be a big deal for him. But relationships often require compromise. If he's not willing to make any adjustments, maybe he's not showing enough flexibility. However, he also has a valid point about his own priorities. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong. He's being honest about his priorities and has communicated that he can't compromise on this. The girl's reaction might be harsh, but she could have approached it differently. The author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong, but maybe he should consider other ways to spend time with her without skipping gym. However, since he's clear about his stance, it's not his fault. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
