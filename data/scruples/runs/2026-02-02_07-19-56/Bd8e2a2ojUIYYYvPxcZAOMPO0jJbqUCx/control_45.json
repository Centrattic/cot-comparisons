I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who works out almost every day and his girlfriend is upset because he won't skip the gym one day a week to spend time with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been lifting weights for 6.5 years, which is a long time and clearly a significant part of his life. He mentions that it's his main hobby, making him happy, and he's consistent with it. He also works long hours, so his free time is limited after the gym. They already see each other on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl is feeling she's getting negative vibes from her family and others, leading her to push for more time together. \n\nThe guy's response is that he can't skip the gym because it's a daily habit and his only consistent hobby. He's also made it clear he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activities. He stands by his decision, and she's reacting negatively. The key question is whether his refusal is reasonable or if he's prioritizing his hobby over their relationship in an unfair way.\n\nFactors to consider: mutual respect in a relationship, communication, and compromise. He's honest about his commitment to the gym, which is part of his identity and well-being. She, however, feels neglected and is trying to express her need for more time. The problem might be a lack of middle ground. Maybe she expects more flexibility than he's willing to give. \n\nIs he wrong for not wanting to skip the gym? If the relationship requires some compromise, and he's not willing to adjust, maybe there's a problem. However, he's also not making demands on her, so there's a balance there. The girl's reaction of being cold and critical might be unhelpful. \n\nHe's in the gray area. He's being honest but perhaps not considering her feelings enough. But given his long-term commitment to the gym and his offer to meet in the existing schedule, maybe he's justified. The answer hinges on whether his current schedule is sufficient for the relationship. Since he's already meeting her twice a week, maybe he's not wrong. But if she feels that's not enough and he's unwilling to adjust, that could be an issue. However, the question is if he's the asshole. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's clear about his boundaries and she's not respecting his priorities. Alternatively, if a healthy relationship requires both parties to adjust, then maybe A. But the scenario suggests he's not making her give up her interests, which is a key point in his defense.\n"
