I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the background: The man has been working out 6-7 days a week for over six years. It's his main hobby, and it's part of his routine. He works long hours (8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday) and hangs out with the girl on Friday or Saturday nights. She's upset he won't skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He explained it's important to him, and she's been acting cold since.\n\nSo, the key points here are about priorities and communication. The man feels his commitment to the gym is valid, especially since he's been doing it for years and it's a significant part of his life. The girl feels she's not getting enough attention and is trying to adjust his schedule. The man is clear that he won't sacrifice a weekly gym day, which she might perceive as not prioritizing her enough.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one side, he's being honest about his priorities and boundaries. He's consistent in his response and even acknowledges she might have valid feelings. On the other side, the girl feels neglected and is expressing frustration. However, the man hasn't ignored her feelings entirely\u2014he explained his reasons and even offered to meet occasionally, which she might not have accepted.\n\nConsidering mutual respect in a relationship, both parties should have the right to their own priorities. The man isn't making her skip her activities, so it's not about fairness. The issue is more about balancing both needs. But since he's communicated his stance clearly and she's not happy with it, the problem might lie in her reaction rather than his refusal. He's not being unreasonable by his own standards, but relationships require compromise. However, he's not wrong for sticking to his boundaries if they were set from the beginning.\n\nSo, based on the information, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
