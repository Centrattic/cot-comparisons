I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for 6.5 years. He's been seeing a girl for about a year. She mentioned getting weird vibes from her family and people, and wants him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He refused, and now she's been cold towards him. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because the gym is his main hobby and he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own hobbies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's refusal is unreasonable. His routine is established, and he's clear about it. The girl is asking for a change in his routine. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author mentioned he's flexible for her, but she's not being flexible for him. However, relationships often require compromise. If the girl feels neglected, maybe the author should consider adjusting a bit, but he's holding his ground because it's important to him.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his priorities and communicates that clearly, he's not wrong. However, if he's not willing to meet her halfway, maybe there's an issue. The girl's reaction is harsh (cold for 3 days, etc.), which might be her fault too. The author's point is that he's consistent and told her his stance. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations in relationships. \n\nIn some views, partners should make sacrifices for each other. The author isn't making sacrifices, so maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's clear about his boundaries and she's not respecting them, then he's not. The girl's reaction is extreme, but her request was about seeing him more, which is a valid desire. The author's refusal is based on personal priorities. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the refusal is seen as prioritizing self over the relationship. But the author is also maintaining his values and communication. The girl should have discussed this earlier if she felt neglected. So, the author might not be in the wrong if he's communicated his stance and she's overreacting. Answer B.\n"
