I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong regarding a relationship conflict. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a huge part of their life and routine. The girl they're seeing for a year wants him to skip the gym once a week to spend more time together. He declined, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that working out is their main hobby, a significant part of their identity, and they don't see how skipping one day is feasible. They also mention that they see her every Friday or Saturday, so maybe they already have regular time together. The girl, on the other hand, feels that not enough time is spent together and is trying to adjust his schedule to accommodate her. She's taking it personally, feeling her priorities aren't valued.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author stands by their boundaries, which is important, but maybe they could have found a compromise. The girl's request is reasonable in wanting more time, but expecting a change in such a routine might be a lot. The author's response was firm, but if the girl was already feeling neglected, the way he communicated the refusal might have been abrupt.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly commitments, which is fair. But maybe the issue is about the balance in the relationship. If the girl is feeling like her needs aren't met, the author might need to consider if there's another way to spend time together without sacrificing his routine. However, if the author isn't willing to make that sacrifice, he's not wrong in setting that boundary.\n\nThe girl's reaction of being cold and passive-aggressive is unkind, but that doesn't make the author right or wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining. Since the author has a valid reason and communicated it, he's probably not in the wrong. However, there might be room for better communication. But the core of the issue is whether refusing to skip the gym is unreasonable. Since it's a daily habit and the only hobby, it's understandable. So the answer is likely B (No).\n"
