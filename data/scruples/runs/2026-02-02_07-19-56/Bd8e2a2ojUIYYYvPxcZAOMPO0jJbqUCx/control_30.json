I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and his girlfriend wants him to skip one day to spend more time with her. He declined, and now she's upset. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (ITA).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy has been working out for a long time, it's his main hobby, and he's clear that it's important to him. He spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girlfriend is feeling neglected and is asking for more time. The guy says no, and she's reacting negatively.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's standing by his priorities. He even mentions he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activities. So he's being consistent. However, the girlfriend's feelings of not being prioritized enough might be valid. The key here is communication and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since he's clear about his commitment and he's not asking her to compromise similarly, maybe he's not wrong. But relationships require balance. If the girlfriend feels she's not a priority, that's a valid concern. However, the author isn't forcing her to stay; he's just not willing to change his routine. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author's stance is about personal priorities.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, it's about whether the person is unreasonably dismissing the other's feelings. Here, the author is firm in his stance but has acknowledged her desire to spend more time. However, the fact that she's been \"getting weird vibes from people and family\" might indicate that the relationship's imbalance is noticeable. The author's refusal could be seen as not being considerate enough, but since he's not willing to compromise his main hobby, it's a matter of differing priorities.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's being honest about his priorities and not forcing her to adjust hers. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, but he's within his right to maintain his routine unless he's willing to adjust. The real issue is whether the relationship can accommodate each other's needs, which both need to address, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
