I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl. \n\nFirst, context is important. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years, which is a long time. It's a significant part of his life and his main hobby. He works long hours, so his time is limited. He spends time with her every Friday or Saturday night. The girl started expressing concerns about not seeing him enough, leading to her asking him to skip the gym once a week. He refused, and she's been upset since.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. The girl's request might stem from feeling neglected. However, the author isn't willing to adjust a major part of his routine. He did explain his stance and even acknowledged her feelings, but she's taking it personally. \n\nIs he being unreasonable? Well, he's honest about his priorities. He didn't make promises he can't keep. But in a relationship, both parties might need to make adjustments. If the girl felt the need for more time, maybe suggesting other ways to connect without expecting him to drop a long-standing habit. On the flip side, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to his commitments if he's willing to meet her once a week. However, if her feelings are that hurt, maybe there's a deeper issue about balance and compromise in the relationship. But in this specific situation, he's not the one violating a previous agreement. He maintained his position respectfully. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
