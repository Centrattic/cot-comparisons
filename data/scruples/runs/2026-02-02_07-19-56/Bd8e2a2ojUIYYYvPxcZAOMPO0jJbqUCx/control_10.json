I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym once a week to see his girlfriend more. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which he's done for 6.5 years. It's a huge part of his routine and he considers it his main hobby. He works long hours and by the time he's done, it's late. He spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights each week. The girl says she's getting weird vibes from her family and others, which leads her to ask him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He says no, and she's been acting cold ever since.\n\nThe key points here: The author has a long-standing commitment to his gym routine, which is important to him. He's communicating his boundaries clearly. The girl, however, is feeling that her social circle is giving her vibes, so she wants more time with him. She might be feeling insecure or not enough is being invested in the relationship. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his priorities. If the girl expects him to change a weekly habit that's been part of his life for years, it's a significant ask. The author also points out that he doesn't expect her to give up her own things, which shows mutual respect. \n\nBut relationships require compromise. If the girl feels neglected, that's a valid concern. However, the author isn't in the wrong for saying no, especially since he's already making time for her weekly. The problem might be that the girl hasn't communicated her feelings effectively or perhaps there's an underlying issue about how much time is considered enough. \n\nThe author's response is honest and he's not being unreasonable. The girl's reaction of being cold and critical might be disproportionate. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
