I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The main issue is that the girl wants the author to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with her, but he refuses. He's been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years, and she started feeling like she's not getting enough attention. The author argues that the gym is his main hobby and a priority, similar to how he wouldn't expect her to give up something she cares about.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has a long-standing commitment to the gym, which is important for his health and happiness. He's already making time to see her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl feels neglected and wants more time together. The author isn't willing to compromise on his routine, which is a significant part of his life. \n\nThe girl's reaction is to be cold and critical, which seems unfair. The author isn't saying he can't make any time, but he won't sacrifice a weekly habit. The key point is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. Since he's already dedicating time each week to her and the gym is a non-negotiable part of his life, it's not necessarily his fault. However, communication is important. Maybe the author could have explored other ways to spend time with her without skipping the gym, but given the information, his stance seems valid. The girl's reaction seems more extreme than necessary. So, the answer is B.\n"
