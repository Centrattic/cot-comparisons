I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and a girl he's been seeing for a year wants him to skip the gym once a week to see her more. He refused, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's been lifting for over six years, it's his main hobby, and he's clear it's important to him. He mentions that the gym is his main hobby aside from work, and he's consistent with it. He also states he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly activities for him. He's not refusing to spend time with her entirely\u2014already sees her on Friday/Saturday nights. His reasoning is that skipping once a week is a big ask for him, and he's honest about his priorities.\n\nThe girl's perspective: she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, implying she feels insecure about their relationship's frequency. She's trying to adjust by asking him to skip a gym day, but he says no. Now she's acting cold, feeling her needs aren't met.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's being honest about his commitment to his workout routine. He's not cutting her out entirely but is firm on a non-negotiable part of his life. Communication is key in relationships, and he did explain his stance. However, maybe he could have found a middle ground. But the question is if he's in the wrong. His refusal isn't unreasonable given his explanation. He's also willing to spend time with her weekly. She's asking him to change a major part of his routine, which is a big request. He's not dismissing her feelings entirely but is clear about his priorities. \n\nThe girl's reaction might be more about her feeling neglected, but the author isn't making her a priority over his health/hobbies, which he's entitled to. However, maintaining a relationship requires mutual adjustments. If the girl's needs aren't being met, maybe she needs to communicate better. But the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around his commitment. So answer B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
