I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and refuses to skip one day to spend more time with his girlfriend. She's acting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy has been lifting for 6.5 years, it's his main hobby, and his schedule is pretty packed with work. He does see her on Friday or Saturday, so he's not completely neglecting her. The girl is upset about \"weird vibes\" from her family and others, implying maybe she feels the relationship isn't getting enough attention. She wants him to adjust his routine, but he's clear that he won't skip the gym regularly.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The guy explains his stance, which is that his gym routine is a priority and a big part of his life. He even acknowledges her desire to spend more time together, but he draws a boundary. The girl reacts negatively, calling him an asshole and acting cold. \n\nIs he wrong for not changing his routine? Well, everyone has different priorities. If he's open about his commitments and she knew this before getting into the relationship, she should have considered that. On the flip side, if she feels neglected, she might need to express that differently. But the problem here is that he's being accused of being unreasonable for not giving in. \n\nThe guy's argument is that he's not imposing on her to skip her activities, so why should he? It's about mutual respect for each other's time. If the relationship requires compromise, maybe both sides need to adjust. However, if she's expecting him to change a major part of his life without reciprocal effort from her, that's an issue. \n\nThe girl's reaction seems a bit harsh. Telling someone you won't do something and then giving the cold shoulder for days is a poor response. The guy is being honest about his limits. While relationships require compromise, it's also healthy to have personal boundaries. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? Probably not. He's being upfront and sticking to his values. The problem might lie more with the girl's reaction than his refusal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
