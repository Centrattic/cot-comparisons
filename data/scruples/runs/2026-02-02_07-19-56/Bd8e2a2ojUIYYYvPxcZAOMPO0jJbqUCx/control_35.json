I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl he's seeing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been lifting weights for 6.5 years, which is a significant time. It's his main hobby, and he works long hours. He only hangs out with the girl on Friday or Saturday nights. She's now saying she's getting weird vibes from her family and people around her about not seeing him enough, so she's asking him to skip the gym one day a week. The author refuses, and she's reacting negatively, being cold and upset, implying that she sees where his priorities are.\n\nThe key points here are about priorities and communication in a relationship. The author is clear that the gym is his main hobby and a consistent part of his routine. He's not willing to compromise that. On the other hand, the girl wants more time with him, which is understandable in a relationship. However, the author argues that he's not asking her to skip something she cares about weekly, which shows some fairness on his part.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has a long-standing commitment to the gym, which he enjoys and is part of his identity. It's not just a habit but a hobby that he loves. He's already making time to see her twice a week. The girl, on the other hand, is seeking more attention and possibly feels neglected, especially with family and others giving her weird vibes. Her reaction after the refusal seems harsh, but her initial request might be based on her need for more connection.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his commitment and not willing to change a significant part of his life. That's his right. However, in a relationship, mutual compromise is important. The fact that he's not offering an alternative, like adjusting other parts of his schedule, might be a point. But he does mention that he's not expecting her to skip her weekly activities, which shows he's trying to be fair.\n\nThe girl's reaction of being cold and passive-aggressive is also an issue. Healthy communication is key. If she felt the need for more time, maybe she should have discussed it earlier or explored other ways to spend time together without him cutting down on the gym. But the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong if he's clear about his boundaries. Relationships require both parties to make adjustments, but it's also okay to have personal boundaries. The problem might be more on the girl's reaction rather than the author's refusal. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
