I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is seeing a girl and she wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and she's been acting cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years, which is a long time. It's his main hobby besides work. He's working a lot, 8:30-6 Mon-Sat, so his free time is limited. He sees her on Friday or Saturday, maybe. The girl feels she's getting weird vibes from people and her family about not seeing enough, so she's trying to adjust by asking him to cut back on the gym. But he refuses, thinking she already knew he wouldn't. Now she's upset and treating him badly.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Is it reasonable to expect someone to change a long-standing habit that's important to them for the relationship? The author says he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly thing, so why should he? That's a valid point. But the girl feels neglected, and the author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her enough.\n\nHowever, the author's gym routine is a part of his identity and well-being. He's working long hours, so his gym time is a consistent way to unwind and stay healthy. If the girl is suggesting that the relationship is not a priority, maybe there's an issue with communication. But the author isn't wrong for not wanting to give up a significant part of his life unless both parties agree. \n\nThe girl might need to realize that his gym time isn't something he can easily cut. The author is being honest, which is good. However, maybe he could have found a middle ground, like adjusting the days or finding other ways to spend time together without skipping the gym. But he says he's only willing to do occasionally, which she wants weekly. So, maybe the problem is she expects more than he's willing to give, not that he's wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the girl's feelings are getting hurt, she might need to communicate that better. But the author isn't wrong for not changing his routine entirely. He's being upfront and sticking to his values. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
