I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl they've been seeing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a significant part of their routine. They mention they've been doing this for 6.5 years, so it's a long-standing habit. They also state that the only time they hang out with her is on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl is upset because she feels the author isn't prioritizing her, and they're acting cold now.\n\nThe author argues that lifting is their main hobby, it makes them happy, and they don't expect the girl to skip her own priorities. They think it's unreasonable to ask them to give up a weekly gym day. The question is whether this refusal is justifiable or if the author is being unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, going to the gym is a personal commitment and a hobby that the author really cares about. They have a job with long hours, and the gym is their only consistent activity outside of work. The author is not willing to compromise on that, which could be seen as standing by their personal values and needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl is feeling neglected and is trying to communicate her needs. She might be feeling that the relationship isn't getting enough attention. The fact that they only see each other twice a week (Friday/Saturday nights) might be insufficient for her. The author's refusal, while understandable, might not address her feelings of wanting more time together. \n\nThe key here is communication and compromise. The author might not be in the wrong for valuing their own time and hobbies, but maybe they could have found a middle ground. For example, suggesting other times to meet, like after the gym, or adjusting their schedule to include one more day without skipping. Since the author is unwilling to skip the gym, it's their choice, but the way they responded could have been more empathetic. \n\nHowever, the girl's reaction of being cold and treating the author like an asshole might be disproportionate. The author clearly stated their position, and while the girl might be upset, the author's priorities are their own. The problem might stem from unmet expectations or the girl's need for more time, which the author isn't willing to adjust. \n\nIn relationships, both parties usually need to make some sacrifices. If the girl's expectation is that the author should skip the gym weekly, and the author sees that as a non-negotiable part of their life, there might be a mismatch in priorities. The author isn't wrong for sticking to their routine, but maybe they could have been more understanding of the girl's feelings without compromising their own. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're being honest about their priorities and have their limits. But it's important to consider if they are open to finding other ways to spend time together instead of cutting out the gym. The girl's reaction seems to be more about how she's not getting her needs met, which is a valid concern, but the author's refusal isn't inherently wrong if they're not willing to make that specific sacrifice.\n"
