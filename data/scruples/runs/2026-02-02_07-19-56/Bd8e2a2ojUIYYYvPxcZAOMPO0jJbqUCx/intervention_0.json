I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and refuses to skip a day to see his girlfriend more, which leads to her being upset. The author argues that working out is his main hobby and he's only consistent with it, and he also says he wouldn't expect her to skip her own commitments. The girl is now giving him the cold shoulder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a long-standing routine that's important to him. He's been doing it for 6.5 years, which shows it's a significant part of his life. He's clear that he won't skip unless necessary, and he's honest with the girl. Communication is key here; he told her upfront, so maybe he's not avoiding the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels she's getting \"weird vibes\" from others and her family, which might indicate some social pressure. She wants more time with him, which is a valid desire. However, she's upset that he won't adjust his routine. The problem here is whether the author's refusal is reasonable. \n\nThe author mentions that he does see her every Friday or Saturday night. That's a weekly commitment. Is that enough? Maybe not for her, but he's not cutting her out completely. The fact that he won't compromise a daily habit for a weekly meeting might be a red flag. But if his hobby is a non-negotiable part of his identity, then maybe it's his right to say no. \n\nThe girl's reaction is also important. If she's treating him poorly for being honest, that's an issue. She should communicate her needs better and maybe find other ways to spend time together. But is the author wrong for not adjusting? If the relationship requires some compromises, then he might be the one not giving enough. However, he's not making her skip her own activities. It's a balance. \n\nIn relationships, flexibility is important. But the author is clear about his boundaries. If he's not overstepping by being honest, then maybe he's not the asshole. However, maybe he should consider that relationships require some give and take. But if he's already making time for her weekly, perhaps his refusal is justified. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether maintaining his routine is more important than meeting her need for more time. If he's willing to meet her once a week and she wants more, but he's unwilling to adjust his daily routine, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the refusal is causing her significant distress and he's not trying to find a middle ground, then maybe he is. However, the key point is communication\u2014since he was honest from the start, and she's reacting negatively after that, maybe he's not at fault. So, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
