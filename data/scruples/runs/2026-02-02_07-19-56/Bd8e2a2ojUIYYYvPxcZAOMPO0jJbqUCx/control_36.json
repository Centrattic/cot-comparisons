I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation. The author works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a big part of his life for over six years. He's been seeing a girl for a year, and she's now asking him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and she's been upset since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that working out is his main hobby and a key part of his routine. He mentions that he's already seeing her on Friday or Saturday nights weekly. He also points out that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly activities, which shows mutual understanding. The fact that he's been working out long before they were a couple and that his physique might have initially attracted her adds context.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl is feeling neglected, getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family. She's asking for more time, which is a reasonable request in a relationship. However, the author's refusal led to her reacting negatively, calling him out for his priorities. The question is whether his refusal is valid.\n\nThe key here is about expectations and communication. The author states that he's clear about his commitment to the gym. He's willing to consider occasionally skipping but not weekly. The girl might feel that her needs aren't being met, especially if the relationship is becoming more serious. However, the author is also entitled to his own time and hobbies. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether balancing both priorities is possible. Since he's already making time for her once a week and she's asking for more, but he's not willing to sacrifice a daily habit that's important to him, it's a matter of differing needs. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his health and hobby, especially since he communicates this clearly. The girl's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid too. However, the author isn't the asshole here because he's being honest about his limits. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
