I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of their life. The girl they're seeing wants him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He says no, and now she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder. The author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been lifting for over six years before the relationship, so it's a long-standing habit and a major source of happiness for him. His job is also demanding, working long hours, and by the time he's done with the gym, he's exhausted. They already spend time together on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl is feeling she's getting negative vibes from her family and others about the time they spend together, so she wants more time. She asks him to skip the gym once a week, but he refuses, and she's reacting negatively.\n\nNow, the key points here are about priorities and compromise in a relationship. The girl feels her needs aren't being met, and she's asking for a specific change. The author, on the other hand, sees his gym routine as non-negotiable because it's his main hobby and a significant part of his life. He's willing to understand if she wanted to skip something occasionally, but not weekly.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. If the girl is genuinely feeling that the time spent together is insufficient and is affecting her emotionally (as indicated by family comments), the author might need to consider her feelings. However, the author's stance is that he's not willing to give up his only hobby, which is a valid personal need. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the relationship is becoming strained because one partner feels neglected, it's a two-way street. The author could be expected to make some adjustments, even if it's hard. However, the girl's reaction of being \"ice cold\" for three days and saying she'll stop caring might be an overreaction. The author's refusal is understandable given his personal boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't unreasonable for setting a boundary, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he communicated his stance and the girl is upset, it's a matter of whose needs are more important. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining his routine if he's not willing to change it, especially if he's already spending time with her weekly. However, the girl's feelings are valid too. \n\nBut according to the context given, the author didn't refuse without considering her feelings. He acknowledged her request and explained his position. He also mentioned he understands if she wanted occasional changes but not weekly. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The girl's reaction might be excessive, but the author isn't entirely at fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
