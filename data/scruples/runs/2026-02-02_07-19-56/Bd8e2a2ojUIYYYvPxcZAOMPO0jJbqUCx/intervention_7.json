I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of their life and routine. The girl they've been dating for a year wants them to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. The author says no, and now the girl is upset, calling them out for where their priorities are.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider both sides. The author has a long-standing habit, which is the gym. It's part of their identity, and they mention it's their main hobby. They also have a demanding work schedule, working until 6 PM Monday to Saturday, and then going to the gym after work, which makes them tired and ready to sleep. They do see the girl on Friday or Saturday nights, which is consistent weekly. \n\nThe girl is feeling like she doesn't get enough time with the author and is asking for an adjustment. She might feel neglected or that her needs for attention aren't met. The author is saying no, and she's responding negatively. The author feels it's reasonable because they wouldn't expect the girl to give up her own weekly activity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and compromise in a relationship. Relationships require both parties to make adjustments. The author is firm in their routine, but the girl is expressing a need for more time. The author's refusal might be seen as not being flexible enough. However, the author is also consistent in their stance that the gym is important and a non-negotiable part of their life. \n\nBut maybe the author could have found a middle ground. Like, maybe suggest other ways to spend time together without cutting out the gym. Or maybe adjust one day by doing something different. The fact that the girl is feeling \"weird vibes\" from people and family might indicate external pressures too. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't willing to skip a weekly activity that's crucial to them. They did mention they understand if the girl wanted them to skip occasionally, but not weekly. That shows they are open to some flexibility but not a major change. \n\nThe girl's reaction could be seen as harsh, but if she genuinely feels neglected, her frustration is valid. The author might need to communicate better or find other ways to meet in the middle. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's position is about their priorities and boundaries. Since relationships require mutual effort, maybe the author should have been more flexible. But since they made that clear from the start and stood by it, they might not be entirely at fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is reasonable. If the girl's request is reasonable and the author isn't compromising, they might be in the wrong. But if the gym is a non-negotiable part of the author's life, then it's a matter of differing priorities. Given the information, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their stance, and the girl might need to accept that or realize they have incompatible needs. So, answer B.\n"
