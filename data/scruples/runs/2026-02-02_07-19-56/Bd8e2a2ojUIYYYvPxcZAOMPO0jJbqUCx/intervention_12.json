I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl he's seeing.\n\nFirst, the background: The author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a big part of his life. He's been doing it for 6.5 years, and it's a main hobby. His job is long hours, and after work, he goes to the gym, then sleeps. They hang out either Friday or Saturday night weekly. The girl is getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family about them not seeing each other enough. She asks him to skip the gym one day a week, but he refuses. She's upset, calling him out on priorities, and been cold for three days.\n\nThe author argues that the gym is his main hobby and he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly activities. He thinks she should accept his stance. He's not in the wrong, right? Because he's clear about his priorities and communicated that he can't make the change. But maybe there's a balance here. Relationships require compromise, so maybe the author is being too rigid. However, the girl might be overreacting by cutting him off and being harsh. The author's refusal is about a core part of his life, which is valid. But the girl's feelings are also important. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points: Did he wrong her by not changing his routine? He was honest. But if the relationship is causing stress because of lack of time, maybe he should consider some flexibility. However, he's not willing to give up a weekly commitment that's crucial to him. The girl's reaction could be seen as unfair if she's using guilt or ultimatums. \n\nOn Reddit, people might say it's a mutual issue. But the author's stance is that he's not the asshole. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I think the answer hinges on communication and mutual respect. The author was upfront about his priorities, and the girl's response is harsh. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
