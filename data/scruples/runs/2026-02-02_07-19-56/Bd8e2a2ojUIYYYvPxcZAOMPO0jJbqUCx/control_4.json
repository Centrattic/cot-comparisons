I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The main issue is that the guy is working out 6-7 days a week, which he's been doing for 6.5 years, and he's not willing to skip a day to spend more time with his girlfriend. She's upset and given him the cold shoulder for three days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's side: he's been consistent with his workout routine, which is important to him. He mentions that the relationship is about a year old, and the only time they hang out is on Friday or Saturday nights. He also says that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her weekly activities if she had something important. Now, the girl is upset because she's feeling neglected and wants more time with him. He's not willing to compromise on his gym schedule, which is a significant part of his life and his main hobby. \n\nThe girl's side: She's feeling like she's getting negative feedback from her family and others, so she's trying to address the issue by asking him to spend more time with her. She might be feeling that her needs aren't being met in the relationship. His response of not skipping the gym could be perceived as not making her a priority, even if he's consistent in other meetups. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, communication is key. The guy did explain his stance, but maybe he could have been more empathetic to her feelings. However, he also stated that he's making an effort by meeting her once a week, and his hobby is non-negotiable for him. The girl's reaction of being cold and criticizing him might be an overreaction if he's being honest about his limitations. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, if the girl felt the need to bring up the issue, it's because she's not feeling sufficient connection. He might need to find a middle ground, but he's also not wrong for having his own priorities. The question is whether he's being unreasonable. Since he's not willing to compromise a daily habit for a weekly meet-up, but he's already meeting her once a week, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he might have communicated or not made her feel valued could be an issue. But according to the story, he did try to explain his position respectfully. \n\nThe girl's reaction seems harsh. She's treating him like an asshole for being honest about his limits. So, the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing by his priorities and has met with her weekly. The problem might be more on her side for not respecting his boundaries or for overreacting. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
