I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who works out 6-7 days a week, refused to skip one day a week for his girlfriend. She's now upset and giving him the cold shoulder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that the gym is a huge part of his life, a hobby he's had for years, and it's important to him. He doesn't have other hobbies and works long hours. He agrees to hang out with her on Friday or Saturday nights every week already. He also mentions that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly activities, which shows some level of consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels she's getting negative vibes from her family and others about not seeing him enough. She's asking him to adjust his schedule for her, which is a reasonable request in some relationships. The fact that she's been upset for three days and is treating him poorly after he said no might indicate that she's not happy with how he handled the situation or his refusal.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable if the gym is his main hobby and he's already making time for her. However, the way he responded might matter. Did he consider her feelings? The author claims she already knew he wouldn't skip, but maybe she felt hurt anyway. The girlfriend's reaction is also extreme, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend's request is about wanting more time together and the author is refusing without being open to compromise, that could be an issue. But given that he's already making time weekly and the gym is non-negotiable for him, it might be reasonable. However, perhaps the author should have found a middle ground or communicated better. But the post suggests he did explain his position and stood by it, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn relationships, balance is needed. The author isn't wrong if the gym is a significant part of his identity and he's already accommodating. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her feelings of insecurity rather than the author's actions. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
