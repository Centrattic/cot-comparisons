I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author works out 6-7 days a week and has been doing so for 6.5 years. They've been seeing a girl for a year, and she wanted him to skip the gym one day to see her more. He said no, and she's been upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side is that working out is his main hobby, he's been doing it for years, and it's important to him. He also mentions that he doesn't ask her to change her habits, which is a point in his favor. He's clear about his priorities and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl is feeling neglected. She mentioned getting weird vibes from others and her family, which might indicate that she's feeling insecure. Her request is to spend more time together, which is a common issue in relationships. The author might be seen as not making enough effort to adjust for her, but he's also not compromising his own needs.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author communicated his stance clearly, which is important. However, maybe he could have found a middle ground. But he did offer to adjust occasionally, not just once a week. The girl's reaction is harsh, but people can react strongly when they feel their needs aren't met.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to make some compromises. The author isn't wrong for having boundaries. He's being honest about his priorities. The girl might need to express her needs more effectively or find other ways to spend time together without him skipping his routine. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own well-being and has been consistent with his habits. The issue might be more about the girl's communication and expectations. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
