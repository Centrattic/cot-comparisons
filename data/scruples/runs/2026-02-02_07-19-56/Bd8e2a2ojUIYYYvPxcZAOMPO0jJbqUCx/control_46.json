I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week for the girl. \n\nFirst, the background: He's been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years, which is a significant habit. His job is demanding (8:30am-6pm Mon-Sat), and after gym, he's exhausted. He spends time with her on Fridays/Saturdays. The girl says she's getting \"weird vibes\" from people and her family about not seeing him enough, so she asks him to skip gym once a week. He refuses, and she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder and making comments about his priorities.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The guy's gym routine is a major part of his life and well-established before the relationship. He mentions it's his main hobby and a source of happiness. He's consistent with his schedule and even acknowledges that she might know he wouldn't skip. He's also given her time every week when he's not working late. \n\nThe girl's request seems to stem from feeling that her social circle is concerned about their relationship's frequency. However, expecting someone to change a long-standing habit, especially one that's important to them, might be a point of conflict. The guy's response is straightforward but she's reacting negatively, which makes him question if he's wrong.\n\nFrom a midpoint perspective, relationships require compromise. But if the gym is a non-negotiable for him and he's already making time for her, maybe it's not unreasonable. On the other hand, if the girl feels her needs aren't met, communication is key. The fact that he's been clear about his boundaries and she's upset might place the issue more on her reaction than his refusal. \n\nHe also mentions he's willing to adjust if it's occasional, but not weekly. That shows flexibility. The girl's reaction seems to be about feeling undervalued, but if he can't meet her request due to personal priorities, it's a conflict of priorities. Neither is entirely at fault, but in this case, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he communicated his stance and the refusal is based on personal values and established routine, it's likely he's not the asshole here. The girl might need to reassess her expectations or communicate differently.\n"
