I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl they've been seeing. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which they've been doing for 6.5 years. It's mentioned that their body was what initially attracted the girl. The gym is their main hobby, and they work long hours, 8:30am to 6pm Monday-Saturday. After the gym, they're tired and just want to relax with their cat and watch Netflix. They currently see her on Friday or Saturday nights each week.\n\nThe girl expressed feeling like the author doesn't see her enough, citing \"weird vibes\" from her family and others. She then asked him to skip the gym one day a week. The author refused because it's a core part of their routine and happiness. Now, she's been cold and upset, saying the author's priorities are clear.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main hobby is the gym, which is important to them. They've maintained this routine for a long time, even before the relationship. The girl is asking for more time, which is a common request in relationships. However, the author is declining a significant change to their routine. \n\nThe girl might feel that her emotional needs aren't being met, and maybe she's suggesting that the gym is taking precedence over the relationship. The author's response is that they don't skip unless necessary, and they value the girl's input but can't make that sacrifice. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. The author is not willing to give up their main hobby, which is important for their well-being. But the girl feels neglected. The author's argument is that they're not expecting her to give up her own priorities. However, the girl might feel that the author isn't making an effort to accommodate her. \n\nIt's a matter of compromise. If the relationship is supposed to be a partnership, both should be willing to adjust some habits. The author might not be wrong in prioritizing their health and happiness, but the girl's feelings are valid too. The way the author handled it\u2014refusing without offering alternatives\u2014could be part of the problem. Maybe they could have suggested other ways to spend time together without skipping the gym. \n\nHowever, the girl's reaction is also harsh. If the author is clear about their priorities and the girl is upset about it, maybe she needs to address the real issue of feeling neglected. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if they've been consistent about their routine and the girl should have been aware of it from the start. \n\nBut the fact that they only meet on Friday or Saturday nights once a week could be the problem. Maybe the author is spending too little time with her. The girl's request is to increase the time, which is reasonable. The author's refusal without considering other options might be the issue. \n\nAlternatively, the author's dedication to the gym is a personal choice, and the girl needs to accept that or realize they have different priorities. The key is whether the author is willing to make any adjustments, even small ones. Since they didn't offer to meet more during the week or suggest other activities that don't require a gym day, their answer might have been too rigid. \n\nIn the end, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health, but the dynamics of the relationship and communication style matter. The girl's reaction is unkind, but the author might need to consider if their current schedule is sufficient for the relationship. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for discussion on mutual adjustments.\n"
