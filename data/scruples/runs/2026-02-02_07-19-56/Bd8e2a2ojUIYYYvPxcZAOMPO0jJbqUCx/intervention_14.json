I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with the girl. \n\nFirst, the author has been working out 6-7 days a week for 6.5 years. That's a long time and shows it's a significant part of their life. They mention it's their main hobby, and they enjoy it. They also work long hours, so their free time is limited. They do see the girl on Friday or Saturday nights, which is their only consistent time together.\n\nThe girl is upset because she's feeling neglected, mentioning \"weird vibes\" from her family and others. She then asks the author to skip the gym one day a week. The author refuses, which leads her to be cold and critical towards him.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: They have a well-established routine that's been part of their life long before the relationship. They have justified their refusal by stating that the gym is important to them and that they wouldn't ask her to skip her own weekly activities. They also tried to be fair by mentioning they could handle occasional changes, not weekly. \n\nFrom the girl's side, she's feeling that her needs for more connection aren't being met. She might feel that the author isn't making enough of an effort. However, asking someone to give up a major part of their routine could be a lot to ask, especially if it's a core part of their identity and well-being.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author didn't say no out of spite but based on their own priorities. The girl's reaction, while hurtful, might stem from feeling unimportant in the relationship. However, the author's refusal isn't unreasonable given their circumstances. It's a matter of differing needs and expectations. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish if they're honest about their priorities and have made time for the relationship within their schedule. The girl might need to reassess whether the lack of weekly time is a deal-breaker for her. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their commitment to the gym, which is part of their identity and happiness. The issue might be more about the girl's expectations and how they align with the author's lifestyle.\n"
