I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author has been seeing a girl for a year and works out 6-7 days a week. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with her. He refused, and she's been upset about it. The author is now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a clear routine that's been in place for years before the relationship. His gym time is a significant part of his life, his hobby, and something that makes him happy. He's already making time for her on Fridays or Saturdays. He also mentions he's open to skipping occasionally but not weekly. That seems reasonable because it's a consistent part of his life and he values his routine.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl feels neglected and is trying to communicate her need for more attention. It's valid for her to want more time together, but the way she's reacting\u2014being cold and passive-aggressive\u2014might be problematic. The author is clear he's not willing to sacrifice a daily habit for her, which is his right. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like adjusting schedules or finding other ways to spend time without gym days. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable given his commitment to his routine. He's also consistent in his communication and respects her interests, asking her not to expect him to skip weekly. The girl's reaction is more concerning, as she's treating him poorly after a straightforward answer. So, the author isn't wrong. Answer B.\n"
