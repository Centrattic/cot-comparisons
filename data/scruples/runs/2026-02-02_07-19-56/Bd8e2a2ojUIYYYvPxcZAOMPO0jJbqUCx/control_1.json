I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to skip the gym to see his girlfriend more. So first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author works out 6-7 days a week, which is a huge part of his life. He's been doing it for over six years, and it's his main hobby. He works long hours, then goes to the gym, and by the time he gets home, it's late. He hangs out with her on Friday or Saturday night. He's clear that he doesn't skip unless necessary, and he told her he can't skip for her weekly. Now she's upset, giving him the cold shoulder.\n\nThe girl feels like she's not getting enough attention. Maybe she's feeling neglected. She's trying to ask for more time together. But the author's response was a firm no. He also points out that he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activity if she had one. So he's being consistent.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The girl expressed her feelings about not seeing enough, so he should consider her perspective. But he's also making it clear what his boundaries are. It's his hobby and a big part of his routine. Maybe she's being a bit selfish, but maybe he's not being empathetic enough. However, he's willing to compromise occasionally, but not weekly. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his priorities and boundaries, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's not considering her needs, maybe he is. But he's also not expecting her to give up her own things. It's a balance. Since he's communicated his stance and she's reacting negatively, it's possible he's in the right to stand his ground. So answer B, No.\n"
