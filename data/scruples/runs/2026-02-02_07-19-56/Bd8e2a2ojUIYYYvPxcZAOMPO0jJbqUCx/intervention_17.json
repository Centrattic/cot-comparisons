I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with the girl. The situation involves a relationship where both people are seeing each other, and the girl is feeling like she's not getting enough attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been working out consistently for over six years, which is a big part of his routine and happiness. He mentions that the gym is his main hobby, and he works long hours. He does see her on Friday or Saturday nights every week. The girl feels neglected and wants him to skip a day at the gym to spend more time together. He refused, and she's been upset since.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, maintaining personal hobbies and routines is important for well-being. If the gym is a significant part of his life and he's not asking her to change her habits, there's an argument for his stance. On the other hand, relationships require compromise. If the girl feels like her needs aren't being met, expecting some adjustment from him might be reasonable. But how much compromise is too much?\n\nThe author mentions that he's willing to skip occasionally but not weekly. The girl's request is for a weekly change. If he's not willing to adjust that part of his life, maybe he's not prioritizing her enough. However, if the gym is crucial for his mental and physical health, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The key here is balance. Are both parties contributing to the relationship? The girl might feel like her emotional needs aren't being met, while the author is holding onto his routine. \n\nAnother angle: The girl initiated the conversation by mentioning the \"weird vibes,\" which suggests she's already feeling some distance. The author's refusal might have been a confirmation of those feelings. But he also points out that he's not asking her to cut back on her own activities. So it's a mutual compromise issue. \n\nI think the crux is whether the author's refusal is within reasonable bounds. If the gym is a non-negotiable part of his life and he's already dedicating time weekly, maybe he's not wrong. But if the girl's request is a valid emotional need that he's dismissing, then he might be. However, since he did explain his stance and she's reacting negatively, maybe the problem is communication rather than right or wrong. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. If he's not willing to adjust that one day a week, it's his choice. But if the girl is feeling neglected, maybe the issue isn't just the gym. Perhaps they need to find a middle ground. However, given the information, the author seems to be standing by his principles, which could be justified. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal values about work-life balance and relationships. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His refusal is based on his own well-being and established habits, and he's already making time for her weekly. The girl's reaction might be her own issue, especially if she's not open to other solutions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
