I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not skipping the gym to see his girlfriend more. \n\nFirst, the author has been lifting for over six years, which seems really important to him. He works long hours and the gym is his main hobby. He spends time with her on Friday or Saturday nights. The girl feels she's getting weird vibes from her family and others, so she wants more time together. She asked him to skip the gym one day a week. He refused, explaining that he doesn't skip unless necessary. She's upset now, giving him the cold shoulder and making comments about priorities.\n\nThe key points here: The author is clear about his commitment to the gym, which is a significant part of his life. He's communicated that he won't skip it, and he's consistent in his routine. The girl, on the other hand, is feeling neglected and is trying to adjust his schedule to spend more time together. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong depends on mutual understanding and communication in the relationship. The author didn't say he couldn't make adjustments, but his hobby is a non-negotiable for him. The girl might feel that he's not making an effort, but he's standing by his priorities. \n\nIs it fair for him to not skip the gym? If the relationship requires some compromise, then maybe he should consider it. But he's also entitled to his hobbies. However, the problem might be that the girl's request was reasonable (one day a week), and the author's response was firm without offering alternatives. Maybe he could have suggested other ways to spend time, rather than a straight no. \n\nBut the user says he told her he'd never expect her to skip her weekly hobby, so he's consistent in his reasoning. The issue is that she's reacting negatively to his refusal. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. If both partners have significant commitments, they need to find a middle ground. The author's refusal isn't inherently wrong, but perhaps he could have been more empathetic or explored other solutions. However, given the information, he's being honest about his priorities, which is fair. She might need to communicate better or accept his boundaries. So, I think he's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
