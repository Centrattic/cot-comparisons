I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who works out every day except maybe one day a week, and a girl wants him to skip the gym once a week to spend more time with her. He refuses, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, the guy has been working out for a long time, 6.5 years, and it's a big part of his life. He says she was attracted to his physique, so maybe he's not wrong to value that. He works long hours and only sees her on Friday or Saturday nights. So he's not completely neglecting the relationship. But she feels like she's getting negative vibes from people and her family because they think he doesn't see her enough. \n\nHe points out that he told her he wouldn't expect her to skip her own weekly hobby, which is a fair point. But he's not willing to skip his for her. She's responding by pulling away, which is causing tension. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about his priorities. On the other hand, maybe he's not making enough effort to adjust for the relationship. Relationships require compromise, right? If she's feeling neglected, even if he's making time, maybe he could find another way to spend time together without skipping the gym. But he says he doesn't have other hobbies and is too tired after working out. \n\nWait, but the girl's request is once a week. If he works out 6 days, maybe one day could be flexible. He says he only skips when necessary, but maybe this is necessary for her. Or is it? It's his main hobby and he's been doing it for years. Maybe he's not wrong to hold onto that. But relationships do require some give and take. \n\nHe also mentions he's not cutting her off; they still have Friday or Saturday nights. But she's upset because others are giving her weird vibes, implying maybe she's feeling insecure or that the relationship isn't public enough? Maybe he could address that by being more open or making other efforts. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's tricky. If he's not willing to make any adjustments, even a small one, maybe he's being rigid. But if he's clear about his boundaries, and she's not respecting them by becoming cold, maybe she's the one in the wrong. The author says he's not unreasonable, but maybe the issue is communication. He could find a middle ground, like switching one workout day for a different activity, but he's not considering that. \n\nHmm. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not making any effort to compromise, even though it's important to him. Or B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest and she's overreacting. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because relationships need both parties to make adjustments.\n"
