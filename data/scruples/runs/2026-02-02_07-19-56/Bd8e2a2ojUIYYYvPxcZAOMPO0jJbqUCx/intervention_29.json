I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for refusing to skip the gym one day a week to spend more time with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author works out 6-7 days a week, which has been a consistent part of their life for 6.5 years. The girlfriend is attracted to him because of his physique. He mentions that the gym is his main hobby, and after work, he's tired and just wants to relax. They see each other on Friday or Saturday nights weekly. \n\nThe girlfriend starts feeling neglected, gets \"weird vibes\" from people and family, and asks him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. The author refuses, explaining that the gym is important to him, and he even acknowledges that he wouldn't expect her to give up her weekly activities. Now, she's pulling away and being upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for saying no. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid point about his commitment to the gym being a long-standing habit and a source of happiness. He's willing to meet her once a week, which might be sufficient. The girlfriend's request is for more time, which is understandable in a relationship. However, the author's refusal might be seen as not being accommodating enough, especially since the gym is his hobby and not a necessity like a job or health requirement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clear that he values the gym, and he's consistent in his routine. He's also open to meeting her once a week, so maybe he's making an effort. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme\u2014being cold and cutting off emotionally might not be fair. But her perspective is that she feels neglected and wants more time, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. If the author's refusal is based on a non-negotiable hobby, that's his choice. However, in a relationship, both partners need to find a balance. The girlfriend's request is reasonable, but the author's refusal isn't inherently wrong if he's not willing to compromise. However, the context might matter\u2014how much time are they actually spending together? If the current arrangement is insufficient for her, maybe the author should consider adjusting slightly, but he's not obligated to. \n\nThe author is not wrong if he's honest about his priorities and the girlfriend is overreacting. But if the gym is a hobby and not a necessity, maybe he can find a middle ground, like reducing the frequency slightly or changing workout days to accommodate. However, the author might not be in the wrong if he's clear and the girlfriend is not respecting his boundaries. \n\nSo, based on the information given, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's being honest about his commitments and has made an effort to see her weekly. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive, and the author isn't required to abandon his hobbies unless both parties agree to make adjustments.\n"
