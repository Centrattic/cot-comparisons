I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. \n\nLifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.\n\nSo, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting \"weird vibes\" from \"people and her family\" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to \"can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more\". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she \"sees where my priorities are\" and how she's going to \"stop giving a fuck because that's what I want\". \n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.\n\nI understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?\n\n**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who works out 6-7 days a week and a girl he's been seeing for a year wants him to skip the gym one day a week to see her more. He said no, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that the gym is a big part of his life, his main hobby, and he's been doing it for years. He's also working long hours, and by the time he gets home, he's tired. They do hang out every Friday or Saturday night. He told her he's not willing to skip the gym, even though he's empathetic and said he could handle occasional skips if she wanted. \n\nThe girl's issue is that she's getting weird vibes from her family and others about not seeing him enough, so she's trying to increase their time together. He feels he's not in the wrong because he's clear about his priorities and she should respect that. She's responding by being cold and upset.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. He's being honest about his commitment to the gym, which is a personal choice. He's not making her skip something she cares about. She's asking for a specific change in his routine. The problem arises if his refusal is dismissive of her feelings. However, he's trying to explain his side and even offers to be flexible in other ways. \n\nIs there a lack of compromise? Maybe. He could consider other ways to spend time together without him skipping the gym. But he's already giving her time on the weekend. The girl's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid too. The author isn't forcing her to stay, and he's clear about his boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. If both parties can't meet halfway, it might be a problem. However, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to give up a significant part of his routine unless both agree. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
