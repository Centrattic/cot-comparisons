      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for keeping late hours. They're a college student living on the second floor, just moved in. The neighbor downstairs says they're being inconsiderate and called the landlord twice in two weeks. The author mentions they do normal stuff like dinner, homework, TV, shower, etc. after classes until 10pm. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30pm. They installed an area rug, but the neighbor is still upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the time difference. The neighbor goes to bed early, while the author's schedule is later. They're not making excessive noise like loud music or arguing. The landlord is neutral because the noise is just daily activities. The author is trying to adjust by adding a rug, but the neighbor is still complaining. \n\nIn most places, there's not a strict quiet time unless specified by the building's rules. Since the author's apartment doesn't have set quiet hours, maybe they're not violating any rules. However, being considerate of neighbors is part of living in close quarters. The neighbor is clearly disturbed by the noise, even if it's just normal footfalls. The author is adjusting by putting down a rug, which is a good step. But maybe there's more they can do? Like being quieter in the evening, maybe moving around less after certain times? But the author feels it's unfair to have to tiptoe in their own home.\n\nSo the question is, does the author have a responsibility to adjust their schedule or habits to accommodate the neighbor's early bedtime, even if it's not officially required? On one hand, the neighbor is being considerate by not making loud noises before the author comes home. On the other, the author's routine is causing the neighbor distress. \n\nSome might argue that since the neighbor is the one with the sleep issue, the author isn't inherently wrong. But others might say that living in an apartment requires some flexibility. The author is a student, so their schedule might be more flexible. They could try to finish up earlier or be quieter after 8:30pm. But if the noise is minimal and unavoidable, maybe the neighbor is just overly sensitive. \n\nThe fact that the neighbor called the landlord twice in two weeks seems harsh, especially since the landlord found the noise to be normal. The author is making efforts to mitigate the problem. The neighbor might need to adjust their sensitivity, or maybe there's another issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're following their normal routine, and the neighbor is the one with the specific problem. The author is trying to be considerate, so maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because sometimes being a good neighbor means making small adjustments. However, in this case, the noise isn't egregious, and the author's actions are reasonable. So B.\n"
