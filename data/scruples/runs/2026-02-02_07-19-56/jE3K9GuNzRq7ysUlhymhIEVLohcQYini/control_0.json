      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about noise complaints from the downstairs neighbor.\n\nFirst, the author is a college student living on the second floor. They have classes until 10 PM and do activities like making dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, showering, then bed. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30 PM and has complained twice to the landlord. The landlord was neutral because the noise isn't loud music or fights, just routine activities. The author plans to get an area rug for hardwood floors to muffle footsteps. The neighbor is giving dirty looks and complaining to others about trouble sleeping.\n\nThe key points here are the timing and the nature of the noise. The neighbor is going to bed earlier, so the author's activities after 8:30 might be disruptive. Even normal sounds on hardwood floors can be more noticeable in a quiet environment. The author is making an effort by getting a rug, which is a reasonable step. However, the neighbor's complaints are about the author's routine activities, which might be expected in an apartment. \n\nBut there's a balance between normal living and considering others. Even though there's no official quiet hours, common courtesy suggests being mindful of noise when others are likely to be asleep. The author's activities after 8:30 might be considered inconsiderate, but they are not extreme. The neighbor's reaction might be a bit over the top, but the author could adjust their habits slightly, like doing noisier tasks earlier or using rugs.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong, but they might need to make some adjustments. The landlord didn't take a side, but the neighbor feels disturbed. The author is new, so maybe they didn't anticipate the sensitivity. However, the neighbor's complaints are valid to some extent. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the noise isn't extreme and they're making an effort to fix it, but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
