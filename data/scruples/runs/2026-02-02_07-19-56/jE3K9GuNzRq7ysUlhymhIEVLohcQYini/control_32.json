      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for keeping late hours in their new apartment. The situation is that they're a college student living upstairs, and their neighbor downstairs is complaining about noise even though the author is just doing normal activities after classes until 10pm. The neighbor has called the landlord twice already, and the author feels like they're being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The apartment complex doesn't have specific quiet hours, but the neighbor goes to bed early at 8:30pm. The author's routine includes making dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, shower, etc., which might involve normal household noises. The landlord mediated and found the noise wasn't excessive, like loud music or fighting. The author is trying to accommodate by getting an area rug to reduce footsteps. The neighbor is still giving dirty looks and complaining to others.\n\nI remember that in some places, there are implied quiet hours even if not stated in the lease, especially in residential areas. For example, 10pm to 7am or similar. But the key here is whether the noise is unreasonable. Since the original poster is doing regular activities and the landlord found it wasn't excessive, maybe the neighbor is being overly sensitive. However, if the neighbor is going to bed early and the author's activities are causing some disturbance, even if not loud, there might be a point where the author should adjust.\n\nBut wait, the author is a student with a late class schedule, which is a legitimate reason for a later bedtime. The neighbor's complaint is about normal household activities, which are part of daily living. The landlord's impartial stance suggests that the noise isn't violating any rules. The author is making an effort to mitigate the noise with a rug. The neighbor's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author isn't doing anything overly disruptive. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could consider adjusting their schedule a bit to minimize disturbances when possible, like doing noisier tasks earlier in the evening. But the neighbor is being inconsiderate by calling the landlord twice in two weeks and giving dirty looks. The author isn't doing anything illegal or against lease terms, and the landlord hasn't said they're violating anything. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
