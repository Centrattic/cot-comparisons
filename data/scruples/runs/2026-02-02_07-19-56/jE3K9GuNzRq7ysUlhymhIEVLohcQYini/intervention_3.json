      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for keeping late hours in their new apartment. They moved in two weeks ago and their downstairs neighbor is complaining. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30 PM, and the author is home until 10 PM doing normal stuff like making dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, etc. They mentioned that there are no set quiet hours, but the neighbor is calling the landlord and giving them dirty looks.\n\nFirst, the author is a college student with a schedule that ends at 10 PM. After that, they do routine activities. The neighbor is very sensitive, going to bed early. The author tried to mitigate the noise with an area rug. The landlord meditated but couldn't find major noise issues beyond the author's routine. The neighbor is still bothered, though.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the neighbor is clearly upset, but is the author doing something unreasonable? The activities mentioned are normal and not excessive. Maybe the time of day is an issue. If the neighbor goes to bed at 8:30, then any noise after that would affect them. But the author isn't making loud noises; just regular living sounds. However, in apartment living, it's customary to be considerate of others' sleeping times. Even if there are no official quiet hours, common courtesy would suggest keeping noise down after a certain time. 8:30 PM is pretty early, but if the author is in the second floor, maybe the floor is not as soundproof, and the hardwood floors amplify the noise. The author tried the rug, so maybe that helps, but the neighbor is still bothered. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a new place, just moved in, and this is their first time being an upstairs neighbor. They didn't have issues before when they were downstairs. But maybe in this new place, the neighbor's sensitivity is higher. The author feels they shouldn't have to tiptoe in their own home, but living in an apartment does require some compromise. The neighbor's complaints are valid if the noise is affecting their sleep. The author's routine might be normal, but if it's causing disturbance, even if it's not loud, it's still inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think yes, A. Because even if it's not loud, living in an apartment means being considerate of others' schedules. The author's activities after 8:30 might be causing disruption, and while they tried the rug, the neighbor is still upset. The author should adjust their schedule or find more ways to reduce noise if possible. They shouldn't make their neighbor suffer just because there's no formal quiet hours. So answer A.\n"
