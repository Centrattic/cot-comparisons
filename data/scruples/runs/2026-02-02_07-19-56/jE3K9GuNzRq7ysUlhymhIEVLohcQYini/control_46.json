      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about noise complaints from the downstairs neighbor.\n\nThe author is a college student who moves into a second-floor apartment. They come home late from classes, do their routine (dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, shower), and the neighbor is upset because they go to bed at 8:30 PM. The neighbor called the landlord twice in two weeks. They tried to mediate, and the landlord didn't find the noise too bad, but the neighbor is still upset. The author bought an area rug to help with footsteps but still gets dirty looks and hears the neighbor complaining.\n\nThe author feels bad but doesn't want to tiptoe in their own home. They mention that in their previous place, they were downstairs and the upstairs was noisy but they could still sleep.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical noise issues in apartments. Normal living sounds like footsteps, cooking, or TV can be considered, but it's about reasonableness. Since there are no specific quiet hours, maybe the neighbor expects quiet by 8:30 PM. However, the author's activities are normal post-work routines. The neighbor's sensitivity might be the issue here. The author did take steps to mitigate noise (rug), which shows consideration. The landlord saw the noise as not excessive, so maybe the neighbor is overreacting. On the other hand, if the author's activities are disturbing someone's sleep, even if it's not loud, it might be a problem. The fact that the author is a student with a late schedule adds context. It's their first time being upstairs, so maybe they're unaware of the impact. However, in their previous home, they were okay with noise from upstairs. The key is whether the author's actions are unreasonably disturbing the neighbor. Since normal activities are expected and the landlord didn't find it an issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The neighbor might need to adjust, but maybe the author could consider being quieter during early evening. However, the author's actions are within normal bounds, so the answer might be B.\n"
