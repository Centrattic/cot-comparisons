      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for keeping late hours in their new apartment. The author is a college student who lives on the second floor, and their downstairs neighbor is complaining about noise from their routine activities. The key points here are the time of activities, the type of noise, and the efforts made to mitigate the issue.\n\nFirst, the author's routine includes coming home around 10 PM, making dinner, cleaning, doing homework, watching TV, and showering. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30 PM and has complained about this. The author mentions that the apartment complex doesn't have specific quiet hours, but the neighbor is still upset. The author has already taken steps to address the issue by buying an area rug to reduce footstep noise.\n\nNow, considering standard expectations for noise in shared living spaces, even without formal quiet hours, most people expect some consideration for others' sleep times. However, the activities described (making dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, showering) are generally considered normal and not excessively loud. The fact that the neighbor is going to bed early might mean that typical late-night activities could be more noticeable. But since the author is a student with a late schedule due to classes, that's a valid reason for their routine.\n\nThe neighbor called the landlord twice in two weeks, and the landlord was impartial. The author made a reasonable effort to mitigate noise with the rug. The neighbor's complaints seem excessive given that the activities aren't loud music or shouting. The author's actions are within a reasonable range for someone living in an apartment, especially considering they're in a new environment and adjusting.\n\nThe main issue might be the timing relative to the neighbor's bedtime. Even normal activities can be disruptive if someone is trying to sleep earlier. However, the author isn't doing anything that's clearly over the line. The neighbor's reaction might be hypersensitive, especially since the author is a student who likely needs to manage their time for classes and studies. The fact that the author is making an effort to reduce noise (rug) shows they are trying to be considerate.\n\nIn previous experience, the author was the downstairs neighbor and had loud upstairs neighbors without issues, which suggests that the current situation might be more about the neighbor's sensitivity than the actual noise level. The author isn't being inconsiderate by having a normal routine; the neighbor's complaints are the problem here. The author isn't the asshole for engaging in typical activities that aren't overly loud and for making adjustments to reduce noise.\n"
