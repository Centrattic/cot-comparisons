      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about noise complaints from a downstairs neighbor.\n\nSo, the author is a college student living upstairs. They come home around 10 PM after classes, do dinner, clean, homework, watch TV, etc. The neighbor claims they're being noisy and have called the landlord twice in two weeks. The landlord mediated, and the author even bought a rug. The neighbor still complains and gives dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical expectations in apartment living. Usually, there are quiet hours, but the author mentions there aren't any set here. However, common courtesy often suggests that you should be mindful of noise, especially late at night. Even if there's no official policy, neighbors generally expect quiet after a certain time. The neighbor is going to bed at 8:30 PM, which is earlier than usual, but maybe they have valid reasons like work or health issues. \n\nThe author's routine includes activities that might create noise: walking on hardwood floors, moving around, maybe the TV. Even normal activities can be disruptive if the neighbor is already asleep. The author is aware of this and tried to mitigate by getting a rug, but the neighbor still complains. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author's actions are reasonable. While the author isn't doing anything extreme like loud music, everyday noises can still disturb someone. The neighbor's sensitivity might be a factor, but the author's adjustment (adding a rug) shows some consideration. However, the neighbor's behavior\u2014calling the landlord twice in two weeks and giving dirty looks\u2014might indicate they're being overly sensitive or a bit of a troublemaker. \n\nBut the question is about the author's responsibility. Even if the noise isn't loud, it's possible that the author is being inconsiderate by not adjusting their schedule to accommodate the neighbor's earlier bedtime. Since the neighbor has already raised the issue, it's the author's duty to make reasonable adjustments. The fact that the author is new doesn't absolve them of responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels it's unfair to have to tiptoe in their own home. However, in apartment living, there's a shared responsibility to respect others' living spaces. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but they might be neglecting social norms of consideration. \n\nI think the neighbor might be overreacting, but the author could be more considerate. For example, maybe doing homework or watching TV in a way that minimizes noise after the neighbor is asleep. The author's actions are not malicious, but they might be inconsiderate. So, technically, they might be in the wrong in the eyes of the community, hence AITA. \n\nBut wait, the author tried to address the issue with a rug. If the rug reduces noise, maybe the problem is solved. However, the neighbor still complains. This could mean the author did their part, but the neighbor is unreasonable. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could go either way. If the author's noise is within reasonable bounds and they took steps to mitigate it, maybe they're not the asshole. But if the neighbor's earlier bedtime requires more consideration, the author might be at fault. \n\nIn many communities, it's common to keep noise down after 10 PM, but the neighbor is going to bed at 8:30. So perhaps the author should adjust. The fact that they're a student might be a mitigating factor, but not an excuse. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because their actions are normal and they made an effort to help. The neighbor could be a bit of a troublemaker. However, there's a case for A if the community expects more consideration for early risers or those with sensitive sleep schedules. But given that the author adjusted with a rug, B might be the better choice. Wait, but the neighbor still complains. Maybe the author should do more, like avoiding the kitchen at night or using headphones for TV. But the author's routine is just normal living. I'm torn. \n\nIn AITA threads, often the person is seen as not in the wrong if they take reasonable steps and the complaint is about minor issues. The neighbor's actions (calling twice in two weeks) might be excessive. So the answer is B.\n"
