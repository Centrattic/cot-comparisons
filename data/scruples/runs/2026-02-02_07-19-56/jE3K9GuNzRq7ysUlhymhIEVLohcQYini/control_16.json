      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for keeping late hours in their new apartment. The situation is that the author is a college student living on the second floor, and the downstairs neighbor goes to bed early. The neighbor is complaining about the noise from the author's routine activities, leading to calls to the landlord and tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that there are no specific quiet hours in the apartment complex. The neighbor is going to bed at 8:30 PM, which is earlier than most people might expect. The author's routine includes dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, shower, and then bed. They've already taken steps to mitigate noise by getting a rug. The landlord was neutral, and the noise isn't extreme like music or arguments.\n\nThe key points here are the time difference and the nature of the noise. While 8:30 PM isn't extremely late, it's still relatively early. However, since there are no specific quiet hours, the neighbor might expect that others would adjust their habits. On the other hand, the author is a student with a schedule that includes being out until 10 PM. The fact that they've already taken measures to reduce noise shows consideration. The neighbor's complaints seem excessive, especially after the author made an effort. The author isn't doing anything that's against the rules, just living their normal life. The previous experience of being on the bottom floor with noisy upstairs neighbors also shows that some noise is normal in apartment living. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might need to find a middle ground, but the neighbor's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances.\n"
