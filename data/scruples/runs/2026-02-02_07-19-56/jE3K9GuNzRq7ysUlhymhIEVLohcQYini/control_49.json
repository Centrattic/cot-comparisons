      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about noise complaints from the downstairs neighbor.\n\nSo, the author is a college student living in an apartment complex. They're on the second floor and moved in two weeks ago. They have classes until 10 PM, and their routine includes dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, a shower, and then bed. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30 PM and has complained, even calling the landlord twice. The landlord was neutral because the noise isn't loud music or arguments but just regular daily activities. The author added an area rug, but the neighbor is still giving dirty looks and complaining to others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical noise expectations in apartment living. Usually, there are implied quiet hours, even if not strictly enforced. For example, most places consider 10 PM or 11 PM as a common quiet time. If someone is active past those hours, especially after a neighbor has gone to sleep, it's reasonable for the downstairs neighbor to be bothered. The neighbor is sleeping at 8:30 PM, which is relatively early, but even so, once the neighbor is in bed, the upstairs activities could be disruptive.\n\nThe author's activities aren't loud per se but normal sounds like walking on hardwood floors, maybe the shower, or TV. Since the neighbor is sensitive to these noises and the author's schedule is after their bedtime, the complaints are valid. The author is following their routine, but maybe they could adjust slightly to accommodate the neighbor. Adding a rug is a good step, but maybe there are other things to do, like using quieter appliances, taking showers earlier, or lowering the TV volume. \n\nThe neighbor's complaints seem a bit harsh given the short time the author has been there (two weeks), but it's also reasonable to expect that if someone's schedule changes, they adjust to avoid disturbing others. The author mentions they were the downstairs neighbor before, so not having to deal with noise from above might make the current situation frustrating because now they have to consider others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a balance. On one hand, they're living their life normally. On the other, their activities are affecting another person's sleep. Since the neighbor has already gone to bed, the author's evening activities would naturally be louder in the quiet environment. The author isn't doing anything excessive, but the timing and the fact that the neighbor is trying to sleep at 8:30 PM might mean the author should adjust their schedule or activities to minimize noise after that time. The fact that they're trying to make changes (rug) shows they're trying to be considerate, but maybe more is needed. The answer hinges on whether the noise is reasonable given the time and the neighbor's sensitivity.\n\nIn many communities, after 10 PM is when you're expected to be quieter. If the neighbor is in bed by 8:30, then the author's activities after 8:30 might be causing disturbance. So the author might be in the wrong for not adjusting their schedule or activities to accommodate the neighbor's bedtime. However, it's also possible that the neighbor is being overly sensitive. But given the neighbor's consistent complaints and the fact that the author is a student with a late schedule, maybe there's a middle ground. The author isn't doing anything illegal or against the lease, but maybe not being as considerate as possible. \n\nSo, considering all factors, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the neighbor is clearly disturbed and the author could make some adjustments (like moving more noisy activities earlier in the evening, using rugs for the shower area, etc.), the author might share some responsibility. However, the neighbor's complaints after just two weeks could be a bit heavy-handed. But given that the author is trying to make changes, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they are making efforts and their activities are within normal bounds. But the neighbor's sensitivity is a factor. Alternatively, if the author is still making noise after the neighbor is in bed, even if it's not loud, it's considered inconsiderate. \n\nIn many places, noise complaints can be valid even if it's not loud. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being more considerate of the neighbor's sleeping hours. But the neighbor's actions (calling the landlord twice in two weeks) might be excessive. However, the author is the one actively making noise, so even if it's normal, they should adjust their habits. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they could do more to minimize noise after the neighbor is asleep. But the author is also a student with a valid reason for being out later. This is a tough call. \n\nAlternatively, if the apartment complex doesn't have specific quiet hours, then the neighbor's complaints might not hold as much weight. But it's implied that there are no strict quiet hours because others have kids or live alone. However, common courtesy usually expects that after a certain time, you minimize noise. If the neighbor is going to bed at 8:30, which is early, but the author is still active after that, it's reasonable for the neighbor to be disturbed. So the author might be in the wrong for not adjusting their schedule or taking more steps to reduce noise. Therefore, answer A.\n"
