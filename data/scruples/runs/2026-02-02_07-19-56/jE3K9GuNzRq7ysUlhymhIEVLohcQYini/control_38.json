      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for keeping late hours in their apartment. They moved in two weeks ago, and the downstairs neighbor is complaining about noise. The neighbor wants them to be quiet earlier.\n\nFirst, the apartment doesn't have specific quiet hours, but the neighbor apparently goes to bed at 8:30 PM. The author is a college student with classes until 10 PM, then does dinner, cleans, homework, watches TV, etc. The neighbor called the landlord twice, and they mediated. The author bought an area rug to help with the hardwood floors.\n\nThe key points here are about reasonable noise. In most places, there are implied quiet hours, like after 10 PM or 11 PM. But this neighbor is going to bed at 8:30, which is earlier than usual. The author's activities aren't loud music or shouting, just normal living. The previous situation had kids and a dog, which were louder but didn't disturb them. Now the author is being more restricted.\n\nThe author is doing normal things, and the neighbor is being overly sensitive. The author tried to mitigate noise with a rug. The neighbor's complaints might be a bit unfair since the noise isn't excessive. Also, the author's schedule is based on their class times. The landlord didn't side with the neighbor since there was no loud noise. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are adjusting by adding a rug but don't need to tiptoe. The neighbor might need to be more flexible since the noise is normal and the apartment didn't have set quiet hours. So I think the answer is B.\n"
