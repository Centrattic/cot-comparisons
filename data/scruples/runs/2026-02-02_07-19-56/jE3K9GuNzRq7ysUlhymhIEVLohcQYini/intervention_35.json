      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for keeping late hours in their new apartment. They moved in two weeks ago, and their downstairs neighbor is going to bed early. The user is a college student with classes until 10 PM. When they get home, they make dinner, clean, do homework, watch TV, shower, and sleep. The neighbor is complaining, called the landlord twice, and the landlord was neutral since the noise isn't excessive. The user bought an area rug for the hardwood floors. The neighbor now gives dirty looks and complains to others.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A or B. Let me think. The user is in a new apartment, and the neighbor is sensitive to normal activities. The user is following their routine, but the neighbor is disturbed. The neighbor's problem might be with normal living sounds that are unavoidable. However, the user isn't doing anything excessive, like loud music or parties. They even took the initiative to get a rug. The fact that the landlord found the noise wasn't major suggests maybe the neighbor is being overly sensitive. But since the neighbor is sleeping earlier, the user's activities after 8:30 PM might be causing some disturbance. However, the user is a student, so their schedule is different. \n\nIn many places, there aren't strict quiet hours unless specified by the building rules. If the building doesn't have them, the user isn't violating any rules. The neighbor's complaint is about the user's normal activities, which are part of daily life. The user is trying to adapt by getting a rug, which is reasonable. The neighbor might need to adjust to the user's schedule since living in an apartment involves some compromise. On the other hand, the neighbor has a right to quiet hours, so there's a balance. \n\nBut considering the user hasn't been there long, and the landlord saw no major issues, the user isn't the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
