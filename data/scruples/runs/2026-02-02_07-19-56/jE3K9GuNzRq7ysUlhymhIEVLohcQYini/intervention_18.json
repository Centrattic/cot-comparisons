      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about noise complaints from a downstairs neighbor.\n\nThe author is a college student moving into a new apartment on the second floor. The complex doesn't have specific quiet hours. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30 PM, while the author gets home around 10 PM after classes. The author's routine includes dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, etc., and the neighbor is upset about the noise. The landlord meditated but found no major issues like loud music. The author is considering buying a rug to reduce foot traffic noise, but the neighbor is still giving dirty looks and complaining to others.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the time difference and the nature of the noise. The neighbor is going to bed two and a half hours before the author arrives. The author's activities after returning home at 10 PM might be considered normal. However, even normal activities like moving around, footsteps, making food, etc., could be amplified on hardwood floors, especially at night.\n\nIn many places, there are implied quiet hours even if not explicitly stated. Typically, it's considered considerate to keep noise down after a certain time to respect others' sleep schedules. Even if the complex doesn't have formal quiet hours, social norms often dictate that. Since the neighbor is going to bed early and the author is moving around after 10 PM, the noise might be disturbing the neighbor's sleep. The fact that the neighbor has been there longer might give them a claim to the quiet environment they're used to.\n\nThe author is making an effort by getting a rug, which is good. But maybe there's more they can do, like being mindful of movement, avoiding loud activities after a certain time. It's possible the author isn't the asshole, but they might need to adjust their behavior to be more considerate. However, since the neighbor is already sensitive and the author is a student with a late schedule, the balance is tricky.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor might be overly sensitive. But if the author is making noise that's affecting someone else's rest, especially if they are in a new situation, they should take responsibility. The author is in a new place, so adapting to the community's expectations is part of being a good neighbor. So maybe the author is in the wrong to some extent, but it's a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the noise is unreasonable given the time and context. Since the author is a student and their activities are necessary, but the neighbor's sleep is being affected, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the fact that the neighbor has been there longer and the author is new might tip the scales. The author should probably make more efforts to minimize noise, even if it's not loud. So maybe the author is in the wrong here.\n"
