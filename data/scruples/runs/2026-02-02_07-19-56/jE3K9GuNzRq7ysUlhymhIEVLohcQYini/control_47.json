      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for keeping late hours in their new apartment. The situation involves a college student moving into a second-floor apartment where the downstairs neighbor is complaining about noise.\n\nFirst, the key points. The neighbor goes to bed at 8:30 PM, and the student gets home by 10 PM. Their routine includes dinner, cleaning, homework, TV, shower, etc. The neighbor has called the landlord twice, and there's mediation. The landlord is neutral since the noise isn't loud music or arguments. The student bought a rug to help with footsteps on hardwood floors. The neighbor still gives dirty looks and complains about sleep issues. The student feels bad but doesn't want to tiptoe in their own home.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The neighbor's issue is with normal activities post-8:30 PM. While there's no official quiet hours, consider common courtesy. Even normal sounds like footsteps, dishes, TV can be amplified in an apartment. The student is a college student with a schedule that leads to later hours. They tried a rug, which is a reasonable step. However, the neighbor's sensitivity to noise might be a factor. The fact that the neighbor has already escalated twice in two weeks suggests a possible issue. The student is making an effort to mitigate but feels it's unreasonable to restrict their entire evening routine. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's right to quiet enjoyment is a landlord-tenant issue. Even without specific quiet hours, tenants are generally expected to avoid unreasonably disturbing others. The student's activities, while not loud, might be perceived as disruptive. The student might not be in the wrong if the noise is minimal and they're trying to adjust, but there's a middle ground. The neighbor's complaints might be valid if they're affecting sleep. The student's actions could be seen as considerate if they're making efforts, but maybe not fully resolving the issue. \n\nSo, is the student in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the noise is normal for an apartment and the student is making an effort, maybe not. But if the neighbor is genuinely disturbed and the student isn't being flexible enough, maybe they are. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to help and the neighbor's strict quiet hours aren't officially set. But the neighbor's actions suggest they are disturbed. However, since the student is making accommodations and the noise isn't excessive, it's more likely B.\n"
