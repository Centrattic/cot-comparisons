I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author speaking up about being sexually solicited by their eldest sister's husband when they were 13. Now, they're 21, and after confronting the family, the sister cut them off, claiming the author lied, and the family is divided.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 13, the author was a minor, and the man was 28. If there was any form of sexual solicitation, that could be a serious legal offense, especially involving a minor. The fact that the author waited until 12 years later to speak up might raise questions, but there's also the context of being threatened by the man not to come forward because of age differences. The author might have felt scared and vulnerable at 13, which is understandable.\n\nThe immediate family reaction is crucial. The sister cutting off contact and accusing the author of lying suggests a possible cover-up or denial of the abuse. The mother's response, not picking sides but being upset about losing grandchildren, shows the family's priority might not be on protecting the child. The author's motivation was to protect their nieces and nephews, which is a valid concern. The sister's reaction of cutting off the author and threatening to prevent the mother from seeing the grandchildren indicates a prioritization of the husband over the children's safety.\n\nThe author's actions led to a family rift, but was that their fault? If the author was genuinely a victim, then speaking up is the right thing. However, if there's a chance the author fabricated the story, it could be different. The post doesn't provide evidence, but the author mentions being told no one would believe them at 13. The hesitation to come forward earlier might be due to trauma, fear, or manipulation by the abuser.\n\nConsidering the context, the author's primary goal was to protect the sister's children, which is a moral stance. The family's response seems to prioritize protecting the abuser's reputation over the children's safety. In such cases, even if the author's actions caused family conflict, the root issue is the abuse. The author isn't the one at fault here; the abuser and the family enabling him are. The author's mental health struggles and the family's lack of support further support the idea that they're not in the wrong.\n"
