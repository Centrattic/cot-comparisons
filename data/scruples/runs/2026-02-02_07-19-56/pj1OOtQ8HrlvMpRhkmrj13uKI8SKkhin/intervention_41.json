I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is at fault. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old who is talking about an incident when they were 13. Their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them during Christmas. They didn't speak up at the time because the husband told them no one would believe a child over an adult. Now, they came forward when they had to go to their eldest sister's house for Christmas again, leading to family conflict. The sister cut them off, saying they were dead to her unless they apologized and admitted lying. The mother is upset because the author took grandchildren away from her. The author feels like they're the asshole for ruining the family but think they did the right thing by protecting the kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was a minor when the abuse occurred. The person involved is their sister's husband, which makes it a family matter. The author came forward much later, at 21, after a period of internal struggle. The sister's reaction was to cut them off and accuse them of lying. The author's concern is for the children's safety, which the sister is opposing.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, reporting abuse is generally the right thing to do. In many places, it's even a legal obligation to report child abuse. The sister's husband is an adult who should be held accountable for his actions. The sister's reaction of cutting off the author and preventing them from protecting the children is harmful. The author's mother is caught in the middle, which adds to the complexity.\n\nHowever, the fact that the author didn't report it immediately might be a point of contention. But given that the abuser told them no one would believe them, the author's hesitation is understandable, especially as a 13-year-old. The decision to come forward at 21 could be seen as necessary once they recognized the ongoing risk to the siblings' children.\n\nThe family's reaction, especially the eldest sister's refusal to acknowledge the situation and the mother's distress over losing grandchildren contact, is problematic. The author's actions are aimed at preventing further harm, which is a valid concern. So, ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to protect others, even if it's causing family strife. The real issue is the sister's husband's actions and the family's denial of the problem. The author's intentions are protective, even if the consequences are painful.\n"
