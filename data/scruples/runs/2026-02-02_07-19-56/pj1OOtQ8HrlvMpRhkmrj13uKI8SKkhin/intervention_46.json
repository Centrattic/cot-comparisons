I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for revealing that their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them when they were 13. They're now 21 and the family has cut them off since speaking up.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband was 28 when the incident occurred. The user was 13, a minor. The husband told them no one would believe a child over an adult, so they didn't speak up at the time. Now, years later, they decided to come forward because they were being forced to go to the sister's house for Christmas again, and they wanted to protect their nieces and nephews.\n\nThe sister and others in the family are cutting them off, accusing them of lying to ruin the family. The user is conflicted because they were taught family should protect each other, but now they feel blamed for speaking up.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the husband's actions (if true) are serious. Soliciting sexual favors from a minor is a criminal offense. The user waited until 8 years later to come forward because they were scared initially, but then felt it was necessary for their safety and the kids' protection. \n\nThe sister's reaction is to disbelieve them and sever ties, which is problematic. The mother is upset because the user is preventing her from seeing grandchildren, but the sister's husband's actions would pose a risk to the children. The mother might be in a tough spot, but the user's intent was to protect the kids, not just themselves. \n\nThe user is being blamed for ruining the family, but if the accusation is true, they're actually trying to prevent further harm. The sister's immediate reaction to disown them without an investigation is concerning. The mother's response in not taking sides but being cut off by the sister suggests she's trying to stay neutral, which is good but hard for her. \n\nThe user's actions were out of self-protection and concern for their nieces and nephews. The family's response is more about protecting the accused (the husband) and the sister's marriage. It's hard to see how the user could be the asshole here. They were a child at the time and are now trying to correct a wrong. The sister's husband's behavior is the real issue, not the user for coming forward.\n"
