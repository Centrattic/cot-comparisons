I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty heavy. The user is asking whether they did the right thing by speaking up about their sister's husband trying to solicit them when they were 13. Now they're 21 and have faced family rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, soliciting a minor for sexual favors is a serious crime. The author was 13, which is a minor, and the person involved was 28. The age difference is significant. The author's main concern was protecting their nieces and nephews, which seems like a valid reason to come forward.\n\nThe family's reaction is intense\u2014cutting off contact, blaming the author. But the author's actions were about exposing abuse, which is a protective measure. The fact that they waited until they were 21 to speak up might be a point to consider. However, the reason given is that they were threatened and told no one would believe them. They also had to protect the kids, which adds urgency.\n\nThe mother's side is that the author is destroying the family, but the husband's actions would have lasting trauma. The author's mental health has declined, which is tragic. The key here is whether exposing the abuse was the right thing, even if it caused family conflict. Generally, reporting abuse, especially to protect others, is considered the right action, even if it's difficult.\n\nSo, the answer seems to be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They did the right thing by speaking up to protect themselves and others, even though it led to family fallout. The family's refusal to believe them is a problem, but the author's intent was protective, not malicious.\n"
