I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who was 13 at the time, reporting that their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them during Christmas. Now, at 21, they've spoken up about it, leading to family fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was a minor when the incident occurred, and the person involved was an adult, which is a significant power imbalance. The author didn't report it immediately because they were threatened that no one would believe them. Now, years later, they've come forward out of concern for their sisters' children, which shows intent to protect others.\n\nThe family's reaction has been severe\u2014cutting off contact, blaming the author, and even affecting the grandchildren's relationships. The author is struggling with guilt, feeling like they're the asshole despite their intentions. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses against minors may not apply, but the focus here is on moral responsibility. The author's actions were to seek justice and protect others, which is generally seen as right. The family's response seems to be defending the perpetrator, which is concerning. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of coming forward, especially after a delay, might be seen as a difficult decision due to fear of repercussions. The threat of not being believed at 13 is a valid reason for the delay. The author's primary motivation is protection of others, which is a noble cause. \n\nThe family's reaction might stem from protecting their own member, but that doesn't justify dismissing the victim's experience. Blaming the victim for speaking up is a common issue in such cases. The author isn't the asshole; they're the victim of abuse and are trying to prevent others from suffering the same fate. The family's failure to support them exacerbates the trauma but doesn't make the author at fault.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), as the author is not in the wrong.\n"
