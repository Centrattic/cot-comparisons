I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start breaking this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The key points here are about a 13-year-old being solicited by an older relative, and the aftermath when she spoke up at 21.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a serious allegation of sexual misconduct. The author is now 21, and the incident happened when she was 13. Speaking up at 13 might have been difficult due to power dynamics\u2014she was a child, and the accused was an adult. The story mentions that the sister, who is married to the accused, didn't believe her at the time. That's a red flag because the accused could have used his position to discredit her.\n\nNow, why did she come forward now? She mentions plans to visit the sister's house again, which might have triggered her to act. Also, she wanted to protect the niece and nephews. Her mental health has been severely affected, leading to breakdowns. She's been isolated by the family, including being cut off by her sister and others. Her mother is upset because she lost contact with grandchildren.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, reporting abuse, even if delayed, is generally seen as the right thing to do. The delay could be due to fear, trauma, or manipulation by the accused. The sister's reaction seems extreme, disowning her for speaking out. The author's intent was protection of others, not just herself. The family's response has been to blame her, which is concerning.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, in many places, there are statutes of limitations for child sexual abuse, but since she's reporting now as an adult, it might still be valid. The family's prioritization of protecting the accused over the children's safety is troubling. The author isn't the one who committed the wrong; the accused is. The family's rejection of her for coming forward is unjust.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong. She's taking a stand against abuse and attempting to protect others. The real wrongdoers are the ones who abused her and the family members who dismissed her and cut her off.\n"
