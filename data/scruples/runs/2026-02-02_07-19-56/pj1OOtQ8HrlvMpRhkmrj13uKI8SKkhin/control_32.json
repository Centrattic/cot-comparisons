I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The author, who's now 21, came forward about her eldest sister's husband trying to solicit sex from her when she was 13. She's been cut off by her family, especially her sister, and is dealing with a lot of fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspect. In most places, if someone is trying to solicit sex from a minor, that's a serious crime. The sister's husband was 28, the author was 13. Even if the author didn't press charges back then, speaking up now might still be a valid action, especially if the person is still in a position to interact with other minors, like the sister's kids.\n\nThen there's the family fallout. The sister cut off the author, saying she's dead to her unless she apologizes and admits to lying. The mother is upset because the author took grandchildren away. But wait, the author is trying to protect the kids. The sister's husband's behavior when the author was 13 might indicate a pattern that could put the other kids at risk. So the author's main concern is child safety.\n\nThe family was making the author go to the sister's house for Christmas, which triggered her. She decided to speak up to prevent potential harm to the nieces and nephews. The sister's reaction is cutting her off, but the author isn't the one who did the harm. The husband's actions are the real issue here.\n\nThe author is not the one who committed any wrongdoing. She's the victim and is trying to protect others. The family is blaming her for speaking up, which is not right. They should be supporting her and taking action against the perpetrator. The fact that the sister is accusing her of lying and cutting her off shows a lack of support for the victim.\n\nAlso, the author's mental health is deteriorating because of this. She's isolated and the family isn't there for her. Even the mother is upset, but the author is trying to protect the grandchildren, which is a valid concern. The mother's statement about family protecting you isn't holding up here because the family is attacking the victim instead of the perpetrator.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She was a victim of abuse and is taking steps to protect others. The family's reaction is inappropriate, and they should be addressing the real issue with the sister's husband. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
