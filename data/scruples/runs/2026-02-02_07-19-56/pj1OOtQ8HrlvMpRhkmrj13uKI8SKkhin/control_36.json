I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who was 13, being approached by her eldest sister's husband for sexual favors during a Christmas gathering. She didn't speak up immediately because she was told no one would believe her. Now at 21, she decided to come forward in August, which led to her being cut off by her family, including her eldest sister and others. The mother is upset because some grandchildren are no longer allowed to see her, and the author feels like she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the accusation of sexual misconduct by a family member when she was a minor, the decision to come forward later, and the resulting family fallout. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the husband's actions, if true, are serious. Soliciting sexual favors from a 13-year-old is a criminal offense in most places. The author's decision to come forward, even years later, is a responsible action. She was concerned not just for herself but also for the safety of her nieces and nephews. \n\nHowever, the author might be questioned about why she didn't report it immediately. But considering the context\u2014she was 13, told she wouldn't be believed, and the perpetrator was an adult\u2014it's understandable she didn't come forward right away. Delayed reporting is common in cases of child abuse due to fear, coercion, or disbelief.\n\nThe family's reaction, cutting her off and accusing her of lying, is problematic. The eldest sister's refusal to believe her and the subsequent family rift suggests that the trust and support the author expected from her family were absent. The mother's initial belief in the importance of family might have been shaken by this situation, leading to the current conflict.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect the children, which is a valid concern. She's being blamed by her family, but that doesn't make her wrong. The person in the wrong here is the husband, if the allegations are true. The author's actions, while causing family strife, were in response to a serious wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
