I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is now 21, speaking up about being sexually solicited by their eldest sister's husband when they were 13. The family has since cut off contact with the author, and the author is struggling with guilt and mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: the author was a child (13 years old) at the time of the incident. The person involved was 28, which is a significant age gap and power imbalance. The author is now taking action to protect the cousins after the fact. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up. The user initially thinks the author might be in the wrong, but the actual situation seems more complex. The key points here are the age difference, the power dynamics, the potential for the author to be a victim of abuse, and the family's reaction to the disclosure. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, any form of sexual solicitation from an adult to a minor is illegal. The fact that the author was 13 when this happened means they were a child, and the person was an adult. The author's decision to speak up now, especially to protect the siblings' children, is an attempt to prevent further harm. \n\nThe family's reaction of cutting off the author and blaming them for destroying the family seems more like a failure to support the victim rather than the author being the asshole. The author's actions were to stop potential harm to the cousins, which is a protective measure. The mother's initial statement about family protecting each other contrasts with the reality of the family not supporting the author, which adds to the emotional weight of the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely the victim here. They took a difficult step to confront past abuse and prevent future harm, which is a responsible and brave action. The family's response, while hurtful, doesn't make the author the asshole. The main issue is the abuse itself and the lack of family support for the victim. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
