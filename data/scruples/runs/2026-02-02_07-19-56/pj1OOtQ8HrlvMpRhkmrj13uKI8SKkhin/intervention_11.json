I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who was 13 at the time, being sexually solicited by her eldest sister's husband during Christmas. She spoke up when she was 21, leading to her family cutting her off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: the author is accusing her sister's husband of inappropriate behavior. The key points here are the age difference, the power dynamics, and the potential validity of the accusation. At 13, the author was a minor, and the man was 28. That's a significant age gap, which raises red flags. The fact that he allegedly threatened her with disbelief because of her age adds context to why she might have stayed silent initially.\n\nNow, when she spoke up at 21, the family's reaction was to cut her off, with her sister cutting ties and taking the children away. The author's intention was to protect her nieces and nephews, which is a strong motive. However, the family is now blaming her for causing the rift. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if there's any indication that her accusation was false. The story doesn't mention any evidence of that. She waited because she was worried about the children. Her partner supported her, which might suggest she wasn't acting recklessly. On the other hand, if the accusation is unfounded, she might be the one causing the conflict. But given the circumstances described\u2014threats to her safety, the power imbalance\u2014it's more likely a genuine concern.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether her disclosure was justified. Typically, coming forward about abuse, even after a delay, is considered the right thing to do, especially to protect others. The family's reaction doesn't negate her responsibility to speak out. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
