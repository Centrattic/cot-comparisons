I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is now 21, speaking up about being sexually solicited by her eldest sister's husband when she was 13. She's facing family backlash, with her sister cutting ties and others being angry. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether the author was wrong to come forward. The sister's husband allegedly made inappropriate advances toward a minor, which is a serious crime. At 13, she was a child, and the man was an adult, so there's a power imbalance. The author didn't speak up immediately because she was threatened and worried no one would believe her. Now, years later, she's reported it to protect her nieces and nephews. \n\nThe family's reaction is to distance themselves, even cutting off grandchildren. The mother is caught in the middle. The author is struggling with mental health and feels guilty for causing family rifts. The question is whether she's in the wrong by exposing the abuse.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, reporting abuse, especially to protect others, is generally seen as the right thing to do. The perpetrator's actions are criminal, and the author had a duty to protect the children. The family's response of ostracizing her seems to prioritize the abuser's interests over the safety of the children, which is problematic. The author's actions were to prevent further harm, which is a moral duty. The fact that the family is blaming her for \"ruining\" things suggests they may be in denial or protecting the abuser. \n\nHowever, the user might think she's at fault because she caused family conflict. But in this case, the conflict arises from the need to address abuse. The author isn't at fault for coming forward; the abuser and the family's inaction are the real issues. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
