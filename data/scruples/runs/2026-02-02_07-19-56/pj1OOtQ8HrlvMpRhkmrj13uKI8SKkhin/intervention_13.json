I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 21 now and is talking about an incident when they were 13. The eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them during Christmas when the family was together. The author didn't speak up at the time because the husband told them no one would believe a 13-year-old over an adult. Now, they've come forward with this information in August, which caused their family to break apart. The eldest sister cut off communication, saying they were making it up. The author's motivation was to protect their nieces and nephews, but the family is blaming them for ruining things. The author is struggling with whether they did the right thing and if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was a minor when the incident happened. The person involved was an adult (28) in a position of some authority, being married to their sister. The author came forward later to protect the children. The family is reacting by cutting them off, and the author is feeling isolated.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, if someone is a victim of sexual harassment or assault, especially by an adult in a family context, there's a strong case for speaking up, even if it's delayed. The author's decision to come forward to protect other children seems noble. However, the family's reaction is complicated. The eldest sister might be in denial or protecting her husband, which is a common issue in such cases. The mother is caught in the middle, trying not to pick sides, which is understandable but also a difficult position.\n\nThe author is asking if they're wrong for exposing this. Considering the potential harm to the children by not addressing the issue versus the family fallout, the ethical stance is that the author did the right thing. The problem might be how the information was presented or if there were proper channels followed, like involving authorities instead of just telling family. However, given the author's age at the time and the fear of not being believed, their actions now are likely well-intentioned. The family's response is more about defending their own member, which can happen in such situations.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They took a courageous step to protect others, even at personal cost. The family's reaction is more about their inability to handle the truth, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
