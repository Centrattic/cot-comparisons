I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is now 21, speaking out about being sexually solicited by their eldest sister's husband when they were 13. The family has since cut ties with them, and the author is struggling with the fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: the author is coming forward with a serious allegation involving child sexual abuse. The key here is whether the author did the right thing by speaking out. The alleged perpetrator was an adult, and the author was a minor at the time. The situation is complicated by family dynamics, but the main question is about the author's actions.\n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The author's actions were to protect themselves and the niece and nephews, given that the sister's husband was trying to manipulate them. The family's reaction\u2014cutting the author off\u2014seems to be a result of defending the accused rather than addressing the abuse.\n\nLegally and ethically, one is generally not at fault for reporting abuse, especially when it involves minors. The author was 13 when the incident happened and 21 when they spoke up. There could be time sensitivity, but given the ongoing family pressure to stay silent (like being forced to spend time near the abuser), the author had valid reasons to come forward.\n\nThe family's response, disowning the author for speaking out, is more indicative of their prioritization of the accused over the safety of the children. The author's intention to protect the niece and nephews is a strong point in their favor. Also, considering the power dynamic between a 28-year-old and a 13-year-old, the credibility of the author's claims should be taken seriously.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest the author should have come forward earlier. However, the fear of not being believed and the abuser's manipulation (\"no one would believe you\") are valid reasons for delayed reporting. Additionally, the author was advised by their partner to speak up to protect the siblings' children, which adds to the justification.\n\nIn conclusion, the author was in the right to report the abuse to protect themselves and others. The family's reaction is more a reflection of their failure to prioritize the children's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
