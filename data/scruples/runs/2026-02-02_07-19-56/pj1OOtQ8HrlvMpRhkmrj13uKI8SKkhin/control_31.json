I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, when they were 13, experienced sexual solicitation from their eldest sister's husband. They came forward at 21, which led to family ostracization, especially from the sister and some family members. The author is now struggling with the fallout, feeling like they did the right thing but being blamed for ruining the family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is at fault. The key point here is that the author is reporting a serious crime\u2014sexual misconduct by an adult towards a minor. In most legal systems, this is not only a crime but also a matter that needs to be addressed to protect others, especially children. The author was 13 at the time, which is a minor, and the perpetrator was 28, making this a significant power imbalance.\n\nThe author didn't speak up immediately because they were scared of not being believed, which is a common issue in cases of abuse. The decision to come forward later, especially when there's a risk to other children (the sister's kids), seems justified. The author's intention was to protect the nieces and nephews, which is a valid concern. \n\nFamily reactions, like cutting ties and blaming the victim, are unfortunately common in such situations. However, that doesn't make the author wrong for speaking up. The responsibility to report abuse and protect others isn't something that can be criticized morally or ethically. The family's choice to side with the abuser or dismiss the victim's claims is their own issue, not the victim's wrongdoing.\n\nThe author's mental health struggles and the family's breakdown are tragic, but the root cause is the initial abuse and the family's failure to support the victim. The author's actions were in self-defense and to prevent potential harm to others. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They did the right thing by coming forward despite the personal cost.\n"
