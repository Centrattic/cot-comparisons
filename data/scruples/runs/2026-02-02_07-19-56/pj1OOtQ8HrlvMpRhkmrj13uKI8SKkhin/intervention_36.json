I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that when they were 13, their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them. They didn't speak up at the time because the husband told them no one would believe a child over an adult. Now, at 21, they told their family about the incident, which caused a rift, especially with the eldest sister who cut them off and said they were dead to her. The author is feeling like they're the asshole because their family is blaming them for ruining things, even though they wanted to protect the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Soliciting sex from a 13-year-old is a serious offense, likely illegal. The fact that the husband is 28 and the victim is a minor makes this a case of abuse of power and position. The author, as a minor at the time, might have been too scared to speak up, which is understandable. Now, revealing the truth at 21 could be seen as a responsible action to protect the nieces and nephews, who are also minors. But why did the family react this way? The eldest sister might not believe the accusation or could be protecting her husband. The mother and other sisters are upset, possibly because they feel the author is causing family drama or damaging their loved one (the sister's husband).\n\nHowever, enabling a known predator to stay in power within the family is dangerous for other children. The author's intention was to prevent harm to their siblings' kids. Even if the family is in denial, the author's action might be justified. But maybe the way they spoke up was inappropriate? The story doesn't mention if they provided evidence or if the brother-in-law was given a chance to respond. If the author just accused without proof, the family might feel it's a lie, hence the fallout. But the author's partner supported them, and the mother, after a breakdown, is now with them. \n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The brother-in-law's actions are clearly wrong, so the author doing something to stop it would be right. But AITA (Am I the Asshole) often considers not just the deed but the reaction. The family's response is harsh, but maybe they feel blindsided. If the author waited a long time, the family might question the credibility. However, the context of the threat from the husband (\"who would believe a child\") is important. The author might have felt powerless then, so acting now is necessary. \n\nThe key points are: the brother-in-law's misconduct, the author's age and vulnerability at the time, the intent to protect others, and the family's denial. The author's mental health is also a factor, but that's more about their consequence than right/wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's action was justified to prevent child abuse. Since the alternative is allowing the predator to continue potentially harming other family members' children, the author is probably not in the wrong. The family's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't make the author the asshole. So answer B.\n"
