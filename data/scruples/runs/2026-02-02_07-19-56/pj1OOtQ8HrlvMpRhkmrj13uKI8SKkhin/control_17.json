I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty heavy, so I need to be careful and thoughtful.\n\nThe author is 21 now and is recounting an incident from when they were 13. Their eldest sister's husband, who is 28, tried to solicit sexual favors from them. They didn't speak up at the time because they were told no one would believe a child over an adult. Now, they decided to speak up in August, which led to family fallout. The sister cut them off, saying they were lying and that the author is trying to destroy her life. The author is now feeling like they're the asshole for causing the family rift, even though they were trying to protect their nieces and nephews.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: the alleged sexual misconduct by the sister's husband. If the author is telling the truth, then the husband's actions are a serious crime. The author didn't report it immediately because they were too young and possibly intimidated. Now, as an adult, they feel it's necessary to come forward to protect the children. \n\nBut the family is reacting negatively. The sister is cutting ties, and others are upset. The author is being blamed for ruining the family, even though they're trying to protect others. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up. \n\nOn one hand, if the author is truthful, then they were a victim of grooming or attempted abuse. Speaking up later, even if it causes family conflict, is a responsible action to prevent potential ongoing harm. On the other hand, if the author made it up, then they're the one at fault. But the author's account includes specific details (age, time, context) which might support credibility, though that's not something I can verify.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems extreme if the author is truthful. The sister is cutting off family members who support the author and prioritizing her husband over her own children's safety? That's a red flag. The author's concern for the nieces and nephews is valid. \n\nThe author's mental health has deteriorated significantly, and they had to move back in with their mother. The family's response is to accuse the author of being the problem, which is a common tactic in abuse cases to discredit the victim. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is not in the wrong if they are telling the truth. They are coming forward to protect others and seek justice. The family's rejection is a tragic consequence of the abuser's influence. However, if the author is lying, then they are the asshole. But the story does not provide any evidence that the author is lying. \n\nGiven all that, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong. They are a victim who is trying to do the right thing despite the backlash. The sister and family's reaction is part of the abuser's strategy to silence the victim.\n"
