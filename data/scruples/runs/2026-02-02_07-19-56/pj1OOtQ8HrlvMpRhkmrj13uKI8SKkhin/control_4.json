I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who was 13 at the time, is now 21. They are saying that when they were 13, their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them. They didn't speak up at the time because the person told them no one would believe a child over an adult. Now, years later, they've come forward, and it's caused a massive family rift. The eldest sister cut them off and accused them of lying to destroy her life. The author is asking if they're the asshole for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, a 13-year-old is a minor, and any sexual misconduct involving a minor is a serious crime. The person in question is 28, so there's a significant age difference. The act of soliciting sexual favors from a minor is illegal in many jurisdictions. The author's decision to come forward now might be necessary to protect the children of their sister, as they mentioned. They also mention that their sister's husband is in a position where he has access to the children, so the author's concern is valid.\n\nThe family's reaction is cutting them off. The eldest sister is accusing the author of making it up. But given the power dynamics\u2014adult vs. child\u2014it's understandable that the author was hesitant to speak up earlier. The family's response now is to disbelieve the author, which might be a common reaction in cases of sexual misconduct, especially when it involves a family member. However, the author is now trying to protect the niece and nephews, which is a moral duty.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for speaking up. Legally, they're reporting abuse. Ethically, they're trying to protect others. The family's reaction is probably due to the desire to protect their own family member or denial. The author's actions are in good faith, even if it's causing family conflict. The key points are the seriousness of the alleged crime, the potential to protect others, and the family's failure to support the victim. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
