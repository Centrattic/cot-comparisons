I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author speaking out about being sexually solicited by their eldest sister's husband when they were 13. Now at 21, they told their family, which caused a big rift, with the sister cutting them off and other family members being upset. The author is now feeling like they're the asshole for causing this family split but still thinks they did the right thing to protect the nieces and nephews.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The key issue is whether the author was justified in speaking up. The sister's husband was a 28-year-old adult exploiting a 13-year-old, which is a minor. The author might have felt powerless to speak up at 13 because of the power imbalance and fear of not being believed. Now, as an adult, they decided to come forward. \n\nThe sister's reaction is to cut off the author, which is a serious consequence. The family is upset, but the author's intent was to protect the children. Legally, the husband's actions could be considered statutory rape or grooming, depending on jurisdiction. The author's decision to disclose could be seen as a necessary step to prevent further harm. \n\nHowever, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe the author should have handled it differently, like involving authorities instead of family, or that the family's loyalty should take precedence. But from the author's perspective, they were trying to protect the children, which is a valid concern. The family's reaction might be based on protecting the sister or the husband, which is problematic. \n\nThe question is about moral wrongness. The author's action was to expose abuse. Even if it caused family conflict, the intent was protective. The sister's husband's actions are clearly wrong, and the author's disclosure might be seen as the right thing. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The answer would be B.\n"
