I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who was 13 at the time, claims that their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them during Christmas. They didn't speak up at the time because the man told them no one would believe a child over an adult. Now, at 21, they decided to come forward in August to prevent the uncle from being around their nieces and nephews. The family has since cut them off, and they're feeling like the asshole for causing the rift.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The core of the issue is whether the author is justified in speaking out after all these years. Let's break it down. \n\nWhen someone is a victim of sexual misconduct, especially a minor, coming forward can be really traumatic and delayed for various reasons. The author was 13 when the incident happened, and the perpetrator was an adult (28). That power imbalance is significant. The author's hesitation to report it earlier because of the fear of not being believed is understandable. Many survivors face that fear. \n\nNow, deciding to come forward at 21 to protect the siblings' kids might be a responsible action. The author was concerned about the uncle being around their nieces and nephews, which is a valid concern if the allegations are true. However, there's the issue of timing. The incident occurred 8 years ago, and the author is now coming forward. Could this delay affect the credibility of the claim? It might, but it's also important to consider that trauma can affect when someone is ready to speak out. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the family. The eldest sister is now estranged, and the author is blamed for causing the rift. The mother is upset because grandchildren are being taken away. The family's reaction is problematic because they're prioritizing the uncle over the well-being of the children. However, the author's actions are driven by a desire to protect the kids, which is a good intention.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether the author is lying. If they are telling the truth, then they're not in the wrong for coming forward to protect others. If they are lying, then they would be. The story is presented as the author's account, and there's no evidence provided to confirm or deny the truth. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, assuming the scenario as presented. Since the author is sharing their side and hasn't admitted to lying, the default would be to believe them, especially given the power dynamics and the potential for trauma. The family's response, cutting them off, seems extreme if the claim is true. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect the children, even if it caused family conflict. The family's reaction is more concerning because they're not supporting the survivor. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
