I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a 21-year-old who came forward when they were 13 about their eldest sister's husband trying to solicit sexual favors. Now, after speaking up when they were 21, the family has cut them off, and they're feeling like they're the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are the initial incident at 13, the decision to speak up at 21, and the family's reaction. The person was a minor at the time of the incident and was pressured not to report it because of the power imbalance (13 vs. 28). They waited until they were 21, after their family tried to force them to spend time with the accused again, which could be retraumatizing. They also mention wanting to protect their nieces and nephews, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, reporting suspected child abuse is not only a right but a responsibility. Even if the person didn't report it immediately, coming forward later, especially when there are ongoing risks to others, is generally seen as necessary. The family's reaction\u2014cutting them off and blaming them\u2014suggests that they might be protecting the abuser, which could be harmful to other family members, especially the children.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but based on the information, it seems like the author was trying to protect others and themselves by finally speaking up. The sister's husband's actions were inappropriate, and the author's decision to report it, despite the family fallout, is likely the right thing to do. The family's prioritization of maintaining relationships with the abuser over protecting the children could be more harmful in the long run.\n\nHowever, there might be complexities. The delay in reporting could be a point of contention, but given the context of being 13 and the fear of not being believed, waiting until they were older and more empowered makes sense. The author's intent was to prevent further harm, which is a valid reason. The family's reaction, while painful, doesn't negate the author's responsibility to act in the best interest of the children.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author is not in the wrong. They made a difficult decision to prioritize the safety of others over family approval, which is the right ethical choice even if it's painful.\n"
