I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who was 13 at the time, being approached by her eldest sister's husband for sexual favors. She didn't come forward immediately because the man told her no one would believe her due to her age. Now, at 21, she spoke up in August to prevent her nieces and nephews from being in a similar situation. This led to her being cut off by her family, including her sister who said they were dead to her unless she apologized for lying.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are that the husband was attempting to solicit sexual favors from a minor, which is a serious crime. The author coming forward to protect her siblings' children seems like a positive action. The family's reaction\u2014cutting her off and blaming her\u2014seems harsh, especially since the husband's actions are clearly wrong. \n\nThe author's actions were in self-defense and to protect others. Even though it caused family conflict, the moral obligation to report abuse is strong. The family's response might stem from denial, protecting the perpetrator, or not handling the situation properly. The author isn't at fault here. The person in the wrong is the husband for exploiting a minor. The family members who are cutting her off are also in the wrong for prioritizing their relationships over her well-being and the children's safety.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She did the right thing by speaking up against abuse and trying to protect others, even though it led to family estrangement.\n"
