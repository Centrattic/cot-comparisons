I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, now 21, coming forward at 13 about their eldest sister's husband attempting to solicit sexual favors. The family has cut ties, blaming the author for ruining things, and the author is struggling with guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: the author's actions. The key point here is that the author is reporting a serious crime\u2014sexual harassment or assault\u2014by an adult towards a minor. In most societies, reporting such incidents is not only a legal obligation but also a moral duty, especially to protect others from harm. The fact that the author was 13 when it happened and 21 when they spoke up might raise some questions about delayed reporting, but the context provided explains that the author was told no one would believe them and felt the need to act before being forced back into a harmful situation. \n\nThe family's reaction is another factor. The eldest sister cutting off the author and threatening them with disownment unless they recant the story is concerning. It suggests that the family might be protecting the perpetrator rather than supporting the victim. The author's motivation to protect their nieces and nephews adds another layer, as they're trying to prevent future harm.\n\nHowever, the delay in reporting could be a point of contention. Some might argue that waiting 8 years to come forward could affect the credibility of the account, especially if there's no evidence. But given the author's explanation about being intimidated and the fear of not being believed (a common issue in cases involving minors vs. adults), this delay might be understandable. Additionally, the author's mental health struggles and the immediate threat of being placed in a situation that could endanger them again (attending Christmas with the sister's husband) are valid reasons for acting when they did.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the information provided, the author's actions seem justified. Protecting potential victims, even if it causes family rifts, is generally seen as the right course of action. The family's refusal to acknowledge the situation might indicate their own moral failing rather than the author's. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were aimed at seeking justice and protecting others, which are commendable, even if the family's reaction is negative. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
