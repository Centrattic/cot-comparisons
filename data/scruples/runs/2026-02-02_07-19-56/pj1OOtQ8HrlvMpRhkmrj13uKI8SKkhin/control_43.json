I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their story. The author is a 21-year-old who came forward about being sexually harassed by their eldest sister's husband when they were 13. They spoke up in August, which led to their family cutting them off, with the sister claiming they were lying and cutting ties. The author is struggling with being blamed for ruining the family, despite trying to protect the siblings' kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are the initial harassment, the author speaking up to protect both themselves and the children, and the family's negative reaction. The sister's husband's actions, if true, are criminal and deeply wrong. The author's decision to come forward, even if it caused family conflict, is about safety and truth.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a general perspective, reporting abuse isn't the wrong choice. The family's reaction is unfortunate, but the author had a responsibility to protect the children. The sister's husband being the one at fault here. The author isn't the asshole for exposing the truth and trying to prevent harm. The family's blame is misplaced. So the answer should be B.\n"
