I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who was 13 when their sister's husband tried to solicit them for sex. Now, at 21, they spoke up about it, causing a family fallout. The main question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points: The sister's husband was 28, the author was 13. Sexual solicitation from an adult to a minor is a serious issue. The author waited until 8 years later to speak up because they were forced to go to the sister's house for Christmas. The sister cut off contact, saying the author was lying. The family is upset, and the author is struggling with mental health and the aftermath.\n\nNow, considering the law and ethics. In most places, any form of sexual exploitation of a minor is a criminal offense. The sister's husband, being an adult, is in a position of power. The author's decision to come forward now could be to prevent further harm to the sister's children. \n\nBut why did they wait 8 years? The author mentions they were told not to speak up before because they were a child and the husband was an adult. Also, the family environment was toxic, with screaming and conflict. The author might have felt silenced or afraid. The delay could be a point of criticism, but given the fear of not being believed and the power dynamics, it's understandable. \n\nThe sister cutting ties and accusing the author of lying is concerning. It's possible the sister is protecting her spouse and not considering the danger to her own children. The author's intention is to protect the nieces and nephews, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe family's reaction is more about maintaining relationships than addressing the abuse. The author isn't at fault for speaking up to protect others. The sister's husband's actions are the real issue here. \n\nSo, the author acted to prevent harm, even if it caused family conflict. The delay is due to valid reasons like fear and pressure. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
