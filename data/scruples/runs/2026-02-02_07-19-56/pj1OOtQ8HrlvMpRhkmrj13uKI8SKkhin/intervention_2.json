I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The author is sharing that when they were 13, their eldest sister's husband tried to solicit sexual favors from them. They decided to speak up about this when they were 21, which led to their family cutting them off. The author is now feeling like they're the bad guy for ruining the family, even though they were trying to protect the nieces and nephews.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 13, the author was a minor, and any sexual solicitation from an adult is a serious issue. The husband was 28, which is an adult, and the power dynamic here is significant. Legally, that's a form of abuse, and reporting it would be the right thing to do. The fact that the author waited until they were 21 to come forward might be a point of contention. But given the threat from the husband that no one would believe them at 13, maybe they felt scared to speak up then. It's possible they were afraid of retaliation or not being believed, which is common in abuse cases.\n\nNow, when they did speak up in August, the family reacted badly. The eldest sister cut them off, and others are angry. The author's intention was to protect the siblings' children, which seems like a noble motive. However, the family is now blaming the author for causing the rift. The question is whether the author did the right thing by coming forward, even if it caused family issues.\n\nThe author's mental health has deteriorated, and they've lost contact with their family. They're struggling with guilt. The key here is that the author was trying to prevent potential harm to other children. If the husband was abusing their position of trust and authority, it's crucial to stop that behavior before it affects more children. The author's actions, while causing family conflict, might be morally justified to protect others.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like going through legal channels instead of directly confronting the family. But given the family's reaction, maybe they were in denial or protecting the husband. The author's decision to prioritize the safety of the nieces and nephews over family harmony could be seen as necessary, even if it's painful.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the person who wronged the author is clearly the eldest sister's husband. The author is the victim here. The family's response, while hurtful, doesn't make the author at fault. They were trying to do the right thing by exposing abuse to prevent further harm. The family's refusal to believe the author and cutting them off is their own choice, not the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were the victim of abuse and took steps to protect others, which is a valid and responsible action. Answer B.\n"
