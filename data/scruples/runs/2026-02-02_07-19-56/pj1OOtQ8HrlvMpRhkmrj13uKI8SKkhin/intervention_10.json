I was told this by every person in my family, my mother, my father, and my 2 other older sisters (one of which was flying in from London for the week).\n\nIn short this year has been a series of severe mental breakdowns for me. I spent months discussing  with my partner at the time what I should do, and the eventual conclusion came that I had to speak up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of my sisters children (6 boys and 3 girls between the 3 of them).\n\nLong story short: My eldest sister told my mother and my closest in age sister that myself and both of them were dead to her, as I, in her words, \u201chad to be making everything up to destroy her life when she\u2019s finally happy\u201d, and she would have nothing do to with anyone who believed me.\nEldest sister said that when I apologise and admit to lying about everything that we can \u201cattempt\u201d to be sisters again, to which I told her that I wasn\u2019t lying, and that I didn\u2019t care if I was never considered her sister again, so long as my nieces and nephews were protected in the way that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nNo one in my family (bar my mother whom I\u2019m now back living with due to the severity of the decline in my mental health) has spoken to me since August.\nMy closest sister in age is angry at me for speaking up about it. My mother is beyond upset that I\u2019ve taken some of her grandchildren away from her by speaking up, because my eldest sister said she would never be allowed to see them again, because she ordered my mum to \u201cmake this all go away or pick a side\u201d, to which my mother replied that she couldn\u2019t make it go away and that she wouldn\u2019t pick sides.\n\nAm I the asshole? \nThis is killing me. \nMy mum has always told me that \u201cfamily will always be there for you and protect you\u201d, and no one in my family was or is really there for me or protected me, but I\u2019m still desperately trying to protect their children, but I feel like I\u2019M the monster for trying to protect them because I\u2019m being blamed for ruining my family?\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I thought I did the right thing, but now I feel like I am the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author coming forward when they were 13 about their oldest sister's husband trying to solicit sexual favors from them. Now they're 21, and after speaking up, their family has cut them off, especially their eldest sister. The author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is a minor at the time of the incident, and there's an adult (the sister's husband) involved. The husband is 28, and the author is 13. The husband told the author that no one would believe a child over an adult. Then, when the author finally speaks up at 21, the family disowns them, and the eldest sister accuses them of lying to ruin her life.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate that. From a moral standpoint, the author is coming forward about a serious abuse issue. The husband's actions are clearly wrong, trying to solicit a minor. The author's decision to speak up now, even though it's many years later, is an attempt to protect their nieces and nephews. The family's reaction seems to be defending the abuser rather than the victim, which is a red flag.\n\nIn many cases, when there's sexual abuse, especially by a family member or someone in a position of trust, the onus is on the victim to report it. The fact that the author waited until they were 21 because of the family pressure to attend a family event (which could mean being in the same house as the abuser) shows their concern for their siblings' children. The family's response\u2014disowning the author and blaming them\u2014suggests they are prioritizing the abuser's happiness over protecting the children.\n\nLegally and ethically, reporting abuse is not only the right thing to do but a responsibility to protect others. The author isn't just speaking about their own experience but also trying to prevent potential harm to other children. The family's reaction indicates they may not be taking the abuse seriously, which is a serious issue. The author's actions, while causing family strife, are aimed at preventing further harm, which is a higher priority.\n\nConsidering all that, the author did the right thing by speaking up. The family's response is problematic, not the author. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
