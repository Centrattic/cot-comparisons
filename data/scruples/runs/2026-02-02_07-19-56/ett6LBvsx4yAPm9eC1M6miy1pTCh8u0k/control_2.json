A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-girlfriend who cheated, sent unsolicited nudes after the breakup, and the author shared those with friends as a joke, which made their new girlfriend angry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author had a long-term relationship that ended because the ex cheated. The ex then sent nudes, which the author shared with friends at a party. The author claims they did this to retaliate because the ex was trying to break up the new relationship. The new girlfriend found out and was upset, leading the author to question if they're at fault.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether sharing unsolicited nudes, even as a joke, is wrong. Legally, distributing someone's private photos without consent is a violation of their privacy and can be illegal in many places. Ethically, it's about respecting boundaries and not engaging in revenge. The author might argue that the ex started it by sending the photos, but the fact remains that the author took the nudes and shared them. Even if the ex was trying to sabotage the new relationship, responding by sharing her private images is not an appropriate action. It escalates the conflict and harms trust, which is crucial in a new relationship. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of privacy and potentially revengeful, which might justify the girlfriend's anger. So, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
