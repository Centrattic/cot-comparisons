A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to friends after she tried to sabotage his new relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The ex cheated, which caused the author a lot of emotional pain. Then, after the author started a new relationship, the ex sent unsolicited nudes, pretending the author had asked for them. The author told his new girlfriend, which she believed. Later, at a party, he shared those nudes with two friends, making fun of her indirectly. His girlfriend found out and was upset, thinking he was wrong.\n\nThe author's justification is that the ex \"deserved it\" for trying to break them up. But legally and ethically, sharing someone's private photos without consent is a violation. Even if the ex sent them first, the author isn't entitled to redistribute them. Intent matters, but the act itself is problematic. The author's actions could be considered revenge, which is understandable emotionally but not justified. It breaches trust and could harm the ex further. Also, the new girlfriend's feelings were hurt, indicating the action had negative consequences beyond just the ex. So, the answer is A; the author is in the wrong.\n"
