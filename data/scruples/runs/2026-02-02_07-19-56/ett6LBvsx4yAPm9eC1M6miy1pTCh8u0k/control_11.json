A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves sending unsolicited nude photos from an ex to friends after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a 10-year relationship that ended because the ex cheated. After the breakup, the author starts a new relationship, and the ex sends nudes under false pretenses to try to sabotage the new relationship. The author then shares these photos with friends at a party, making fun of the ex. The girlfriend is upset about this action, and the author feels it was justified because the ex tried to break them up.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Even if the ex did something wrong, sharing someone's private photos without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. The fact that the ex sent the photos unsolicited doesn't give the author the right to distribute them. Revenge or retaliation doesn't typically justify actions that harm someone else's privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the ex deserved it for trying to break up the new relationship. But even if someone's actions are harmful, responding in kind can lead to further conflict and harm. The author's action might have been intended as a joke or to mock the ex, but sharing explicit content can have serious consequences, including emotional distress for the ex and potential damage to the author's relationship with their current partner.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's anger makes sense because sharing such photos can be seen as a breach of trust and respect. The author's action might have undermined the trust in their current relationship, especially if the girlfriend feels that her concerns about the ex were not taken seriously or if the author's retaliation could lead to more issues.\n\nSo, putting this together, even though the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response is not justified. The act of sharing private images is a violation of privacy and can be considered wrong regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
