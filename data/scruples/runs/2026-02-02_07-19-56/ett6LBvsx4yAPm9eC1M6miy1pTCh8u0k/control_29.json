A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by sending his ex's nudes to friends. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex were together for ten years. She cheated, he went through a breakup, then started a new relationship. The ex sent unsolicited nudes with a message implying he asked for them. He told his girlfriend, who believed him. Later, at a party, he sent those photos to two friends and made fun of them, which the girlfriend found out and was angry about. The author feels justified because he thinks the ex deserved it for trying to break them up.\n\nSo, the key points here. The ex sent unsolicited nudes. The author shared them without consent. The question is about whether this action is wrong.\n\nLegally, sharing someone's intimate images without their consent is usually illegal in many places. Even if the person sent them first, that doesn't give the recipient the right to share them. The author's defense is that the ex deserved it, but that doesn't change the fact that sharing nudes is a violation of privacy and trust. \n\nEthically, even if the ex was trying to sabotage the relationship, revenge through sharing private images is harmful. It can damage relationships, cause emotional distress, and perpetuate a cycle of hurt. The author's justification is based on perceived wrongdoing by the ex, but that doesn't make his actions right. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is anger, which makes sense because sharing private images is a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was to mock the ex, it's still a harmful act. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author's actions are wrong regardless of his reasoning. The answer should be A.\n"
