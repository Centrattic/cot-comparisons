A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who shared their ex's nudes with friends after the ex sent them unsolicited is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated for years, which is a major betrayal. The person went through a tough time, then found a new partner. The ex then sent nudes with a misleading caption trying to disrupt the new relationship. The person told their girlfriend, who believed them. Then, at a party, they sent the photos to two friends and made fun of them, not directly but it was obvious. The girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nNow, the key points here. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, but the person shared them with friends. Even though the ex might have been trying to cause trouble, sharing private photos without consent is generally wrong. Even if the ex initiated by sending them, forwarding them is a violation of privacy. The person's intention was to mock and retaliate, which isn't a valid justification. The fact that others saw it could have reputational harm, even if just three people. The girlfriend's reaction makes sense because sharing such content breaches trust and could harm the new relationship. Legally and ethically, sharing someone's nudes without their permission is problematic, regardless of the context. So even if the ex is at fault, the author's actions are wrong. So answer A.\n"
