A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to his friends. The situation is a bit complex. The ex cheated for years, sent nudes after the breakup, and the author shared them to retaliate. His current girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, legal considerations: sharing someone's private photos without consent is illegal in many places, regardless of the reason. Even if it's for revenge, it's still a violation of privacy. So legally, he's probably in the wrong.\n\nMoral perspective: Even if the ex did something wrong, retaliating by sharing nudes isn't acceptable. It's a form of humiliation and could be considered bullying or harassment. The author's actions might cause further harm to the ex, even if he thinks she \"deserved it.\" Also, the fact that his current girlfriend is upset shows that it affected their relationship negatively.\n\nIntent matters, but doesn't excuse the action. The author's intention was to get back at the ex, but that doesn't make it right. The action was harmful and could lead to consequences for both the ex and the author, like embarrassment or legal trouble.\n\nThe ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is also a problem, but that doesn't give the author the right to share them. The cycle of revenge can lead to more issues. The author's behavior might be seen as immature and not handling the situation in a healthy way.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because sharing someone's private photos without consent is wrong regardless of the motivation. Even if there's a history of betrayal, the method of retaliation crosses a line.\n"
