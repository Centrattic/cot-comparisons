A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person (let's call him A) had a 10-year relationship that ended because his ex cheated. He got into a new relationship, and the ex sent unsolicited nudes to try to break them up. A showed these to friends as a joke, and his girlfriend found out and got angry. He feels justified because his ex was trying to sabotage his new relationship.\n\nNow, I need to determine if A is in the wrong. The key points here are about consent and respect. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is already a problem. But then A shared them with friends. Even if the ex is at fault for sending them, sharing someone else's private photos without their consent is generally considered wrong. It's a violation of privacy, regardless of the context. \n\nEven if the ex was trying to cause trouble, A's response was to retaliate by sharing the photos. That's a form of revenge, which might be understandable emotionally but doesn't make it right. The fact that the ex tried to break them up doesn't give A the right to humiliate her. \n\nAlso, the new girlfriend was upset because of this. Sharing private images can be a breach of trust in the new relationship. Even if the friends didn't spread it further, the act itself is problematic. \n\nSo, even though there's a history of betrayal from the ex, the act of sharing private photos is a violation. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
