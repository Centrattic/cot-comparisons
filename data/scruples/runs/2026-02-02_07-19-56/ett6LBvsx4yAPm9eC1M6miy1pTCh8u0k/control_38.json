A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves sending unsolicited nude photos from an ex to friends. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex cheated, the author was affected, met a new girlfriend, the ex sent nudes to the author, and then the author shared those photos with friends at a party. The girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nThe main question is about whether sharing the photos was justified. Legally, sharing someone's private photos without consent is usually a violation of privacy laws, especially if it's non-consensual. Even if the ex sent them, that doesn't give the author the right to distribute them. \n\nEthically, it's about respect and trust. The author's action could be seen as retaliatory. Even if the ex was trying to cause trouble, sharing private images is a serious breach. The author's girlfriend being angry makes sense because it shows a lack of respect for her partner's boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the ex \"deserved it,\" but that's a slippery slope. Retaliation isn't a valid excuse for harmful actions. The friends involved might also be complicit, but the main issue is the author's choice to share the photos.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author is in the wrong. Even if there's a history of betrayal, sharing private photos isn't acceptable. The answer should be A.\n"
