A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his ex were together for ten years, but she cheated. He got really depressed and then started a new relationship. His ex found out about this new relationship and sent him unsolicited nudes, pretending he had asked for them. He told his new girlfriend about it, and she believed him. Then at a mutual friend's party, he sent the nudes to two friends and made fun of them, even though they didn't show them to others. His girlfriend found out and was angry, and he thinks he was justified because he thought the ex deserved it for trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The ex sent unsolicited nudes, which is a privacy violation. The author then shared those nudes with friends, even if it was in a private setting. The act of sharing private photos without consent is a big issue. Even if the ex sent them first, that doesn't give the author the right to share them. The fact that he made fun of the photos adds another layer of disrespect and potential harm.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author was hurt by the ex's actions, and he's dealing with the aftermath. However, revenge or retaliation, especially involving personal content, is generally not considered justified. Privacy is a legal and ethical concern. In many places, sharing someone's nude photos without their consent is illegal, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the ex started it, sharing them is a violation of trust and privacy.\n\nThe author's defense is that the ex \"deserved it,\" but that doesn't make it right. Retaliation can lead to a cycle of harm. The new girlfriend's anger makes sense because sharing such photos could damage her relationship with the author. Trust is crucial in relationships, and using private material as a weapon can erode that trust.\n\nAlso, even though only friends saw the photos, the act of sharing them is still problematic. The ex might have sent them with malicious intent, but the author's response is not the appropriate way to handle it. There are other ways to deal with betrayal and anger, like communication, setting boundaries, or seeking support without violating someone else's privacy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author has a valid reason for feeling wronged, his actions of sharing the nudes were unethical and likely illegal. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
