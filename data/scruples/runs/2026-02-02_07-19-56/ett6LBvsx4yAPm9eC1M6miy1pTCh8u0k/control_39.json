A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex-girlfriend sent unsolicited nude photos after their breakup, claiming the author had asked for them. The author told his current girlfriend about the nudes and got her to believe the ex was trying to break them up. Then, at a party, he sent the photos to two friends and made fun of them, which the girlfriend found out and was upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is already a red flag. However, the author's response was to share those photos with friends. Even if the ex was trying to sabotage the current relationship, sharing someone's private photos without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The author might feel justified because the ex initiated the behavior, but that doesn't make sharing them okay. \n\nAlso, the author admitted to making fun of the photos, which adds an element of mockery and potentially humiliation. Even if only three people saw them, it's still spreading the ex's private content. The girlfriend was upset because of this, and the author's actions could damage trust in his current relationship. \n\nAnother point is the author's mental state. He was recovering from a cheating scandal and depression, which might have influenced his actions. But that doesn't excuse the behavior. Everyone makes mistakes, but the key here is whether sharing the nudes was a reasonable response. \n\nLegally, sharing someone's nudes without consent can be considered a crime in many places, regardless of the context. Ethically, it's about respecting others' privacy and not engaging in retaliation that could harm someone else. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's actions could be seen as a form of revenge, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because he violated his ex's privacy and damaged his current relationship by sharing the nudes. The justification that the ex started it doesn't hold up in terms of ethics or legality. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
