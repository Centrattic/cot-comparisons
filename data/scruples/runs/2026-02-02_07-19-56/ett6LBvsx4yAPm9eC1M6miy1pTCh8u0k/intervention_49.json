A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's ex sent unsolicited nudes after the breakup. That's a red flag right there. Sending explicit photos without the recipient's consent is a privacy violation and could be considered harassment or inappropriate. The ex was trying to get back together, which is manipulative behavior. \n\nThen, when the author found out his current girlfriend had cheated on him over a long period, he went through a tough time. He started a new relationship with a girl who helped him recover. The ex then found out about the new relationship and sent nudes, pretending the author had asked for them. The author tells his girlfriend about this, and she believes him because the ex has a history of trying to get back with him. \n\nLater, at a party, the author sends those nudes to two close friends and makes fun of the photos. The key points here are that the author shared private content without consent, even if it was just a few friends. Sharing someone's private photos, especially nudes, is a serious breach of privacy and can cause harm. Even if the friends didn't directly mock the ex, the act itself is a violation. \n\nThe author's justification is that the ex deserved it for trying to break them up. But that doesn't make it right. Retaliation doesn't excuse sharing someone's private content. The ex's actions were wrong, but the author's response crosses a line. \n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's reaction, she was angry, which suggests that the action affected their relationship. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful and untrustworthy, especially when it comes to handling private information. \n\nSo putting it all together, even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's decision to share those photos was a mistake. Privacy violations are a big deal, and retaliating with similar harmful actions doesn't resolve the issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
