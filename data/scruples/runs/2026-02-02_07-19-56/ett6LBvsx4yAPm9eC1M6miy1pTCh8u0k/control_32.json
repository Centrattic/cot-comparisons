A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing his ex's unsolicited nudes with friends after she sent them. The situation is that the ex cheated, the author is in a new relationship now, and the ex sent nudes pretending the author asked for them. The author then shared those photos with friends at a party, making fun of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Even if the ex did something wrong, sharing her nudes without consent is a big issue. The author got the photos unsolicited, so they didn't ask for them. Then sending them to friends is a violation of privacy. Even if the ex tried to break them up, that doesn't justify sharing private images. The author might feel justified because of the betrayal, but revenge doesn't make it right. The ex could face real harm from this, like embarrassment or damage to her reputation. Also, the author's girlfriend is upset, which complicates their new relationship. Legally, sharing someone's nudes without consent can be illegal in many places. So, despite the context, the action is unethical and likely illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
