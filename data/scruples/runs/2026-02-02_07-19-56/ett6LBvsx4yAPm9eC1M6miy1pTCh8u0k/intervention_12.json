A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to his friends. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his ex were together for ten years, but she cheated. He was really hurt and had a breakdown. Then he got back with someone new, and the ex sent him nudes, pretending he had asked for them. He told his new girlfriend, who believed him. Later, at a party, he showed the nudes to two friends, making fun of them. His girlfriend found out and was angry. He feels justified because he thinks the ex deserved it for trying to break them up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: sharing private photos without consent, even if the ex sent them unsolicited. The author is sharing someone else's private content, which is a big no-no. Even if the ex initiated sending the photos, the author still shouldn't have redistributed them. It's about respecting privacy and boundaries. The fact that it's nudes makes it even more serious. \n\nI should consider the legal aspect too. In many places, sharing someone's nude photos without their consent is illegal, regardless of context. Even if the ex sent them first, forwarding them is a violation. Also, the author's justification that the ex \"deserved it\" doesn't excuse the action. Revenge or retaliation doesn't make it right. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a sign that the action was wrong. She was angry, which suggests that even within their relationship, this was a breach of trust or respect. The author might have thought it was justified, but the act itself is unethical and likely illegal. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. Even if there were hurt feelings, sharing someone's private photos is not acceptable. The answer should be A.\n"
