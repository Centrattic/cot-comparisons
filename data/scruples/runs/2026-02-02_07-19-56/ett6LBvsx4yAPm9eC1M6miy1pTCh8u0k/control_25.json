A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sharing their ex's nudes with friends. The situation is that the ex sent unsolicited nudes after the breakup, and the author, who's in a new relationship, shared them at a party with mutual friends. The girlfriend found out and was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is a privacy violation from the start. The author shared them with friends, which could be seen as furthering the harm. Even though the ex was cheating, sharing personal photos without consent is generally wrong. The author might feel justified because of the ex's actions, but the act of distributing the photos could still be unethical.\n\nAlso, the author's new girlfriend is upset. Her trust might be shaken because the author didn't protect her from potential conflict. Even if the ex had wronged them, sharing private content could be seen as a breach of privacy and respect. There's a difference between revenge and respecting boundaries. The author's action might have been a way to cope, but it's important to handle things without further violating someone else's privacy, even if they've done something wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In many places, sharing nude photos without consent is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the ex sent them first, the author isn't justified in redistributing them. So legally, they might be in the wrong. Ethically, it's about respecting privacy and not retaliating with harmful actions. The author's justification might be understandable emotionally, but it doesn't make it right. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
