A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who sent their ex's unsolicited nudes to friends is in the wrong. So first, I need to look at the situation carefully.\n\nThe author was in a 10-year relationship that ended because the ex cheated. The ex then sent nudes to the author, pretending the author had asked for them. The author told his new girlfriend about it, which the girlfriend believed. Later, the author shared the photos with friends at a party, making fun of the ex. The new girlfriend found out and was upset. The author feels justified because he thinks the ex deserved it for trying to break them up.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The ex sent the photos unsolicited, which is already a privacy violation. But the author then shared those photos with friends, even if they weren't directly making fun of the ex, it was implied. Even if the ex might have wronged him, retaliating by sharing personal images is a problem. \n\nThe key points: sharing someone's private photos without consent is a violation of their privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if someone has done something wrong, it doesn't justify spreading their personal content. The author's actions could be seen as vengeful and could cause harm to the ex, especially if the photos are sensitive. Additionally, doing this in front of friends might have been intended to humiliate the ex, which is not acceptable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable because sharing such content breaches trust and can be considered harassment or revenge. The author might feel justified, but from a legal and moral standpoint, sharing someone's private photos without their consent is wrong. There's also the aspect of consent\u2014since the ex didn't ask for this, the author's action is a misuse of the photos. \n\nEven though the ex sent the photos unsolicited, the author's response crosses a line. It's about respecting boundaries and privacy. So, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. They should have handled the situation without retaliating in a way that violates the ex's privacy.\n"
