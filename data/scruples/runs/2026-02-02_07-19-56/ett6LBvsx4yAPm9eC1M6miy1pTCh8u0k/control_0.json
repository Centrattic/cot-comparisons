A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing their ex's nudes with friends after a breakup. The situation is a bit complicated. \n\nFirst, the author was in a 10-year relationship with his ex, who cheated on him. That's a big betrayal, and it sounds like he went through a lot of pain. Then he met a new girlfriend who helped him recover. The ex found out about the new relationship and sent him unsolicited nudes, which he told his girlfriend about. She believed him because the ex had previously tried to get back together. \n\nThe key event is that the author sent the nudes to two close friends at a party, where they made fun of the photos. The new girlfriend found out and was angry. The author justifies it because he feels the ex deserved it for trying to break them up.\n\nSo, from a legal and ethical standpoint, sharing someone's explicit photos without their consent is a clear violation of privacy and is illegal in many places. Even if the ex sent the nudes first, once they were sent, they belong to the recipient, and sharing them without permission is still wrong. The author might think it's justified due to the cheating and the ex's actions, but that doesn't make it right. The act of sharing the nudes, even if among friends, can be harmful and crosses a line.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger is understandable because it breaches trust and could damage the current relationship. Revenge or humiliation isn't an acceptable justification for such an action. So, even though the author has a history of being wronged, his actions still constitute a breach of privacy and trust, making him at fault here.\n"
