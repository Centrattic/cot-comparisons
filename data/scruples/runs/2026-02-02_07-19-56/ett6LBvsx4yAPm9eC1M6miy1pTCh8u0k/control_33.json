A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's nudes to friends. The scenario involves a long-term relationship that ended because the ex cheated. The author is now in a new relationship, and the ex sent unsolicited nudes to try to break them up. The author then shared those nudes with friends at a party, making fun of them, and his girlfriend found out and was upset. He feels justified because he thinks the ex deserved it for trying to sabotage their new relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Sharing someone's private photos without consent is generally a violation of their privacy and can be considered harassment or even a criminal act, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if the ex sent them unsolicited, that doesn't give the author the right to distribute them. The intent might matter, but the action itself is likely wrong regardless.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author's actions could be seen as retaliatory. Even if the ex was manipulative, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line, especially since it involved sharing intimate photos. This could cause further harm and is not a healthy way to handle the situation. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because trust and respect are crucial in a relationship, and sharing someone's private content breaches that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's justification is that the ex tried to break them up. But that doesn't excuse the action. Retaliation often leads to more problems. The author should have handled it through other means, like ignoring the ex or setting boundaries, rather than sharing the nudes.\n\nSo, considering both the legal/ethical standpoint and the relationship dynamics, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. The act of sharing the images, even in a small group, is inappropriate and harmful. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
