A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent their ex's unsolicited nude photos to friends is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The ex cheated, sent nudes after the breakup, and tried to break up the current relationship. The author shared the photos with friends at a party to mock their ex. The girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nLegally, sharing someone's private photos without consent is a violation of privacy laws in many places. Even if the ex sent them first, that doesn't give permission to share them. The fact that the author shared them to get back at their ex might be their reasoning, but revenge doesn't justify breaking the law. \n\nEthically, it's about respecting boundaries. The ex's actions were wrong, but sharing private content is a serious breach of trust. The author's friends might have a right to privacy too, as they were involved. The girlfriend's anger makes sense because sharing intimate images can damage trust and relationships. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. They felt justified due to their ex's actions, but that doesn't negate the harm caused. The ex initiated the cheating and sent the nudes, but the author's response was to retaliate, which could escalate the situation. \n\nSo, even though the ex started it, the author's action of sharing the photos is still wrong. The right choice here is A.\n"
