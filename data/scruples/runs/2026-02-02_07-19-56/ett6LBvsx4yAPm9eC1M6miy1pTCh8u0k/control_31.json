A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a 10-year relationship where his ex cheated. He was really hurt and went through depression, then got into a new relationship with a girl who helped him recover. The ex found out about the new relationship and sent him unsolicited nudes, pretending he asked for them. He told his girlfriend about the unsolicited messages, and the ex had previously tried to get back together. Then, at a mutual friend's party, he sent the nudes to two friends and made fun of the photo. The girlfriend found out and was angry, but the author thinks it was justified because the ex tried to break them up.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The key points here are about sending someone's private photos without consent, even if it's an ex. Even though the ex sent them unsolicited, the author is sharing them further. Legally, in many places, sharing someone's nude photos without their consent is a violation of privacy and can be illegal, regardless of the circumstances. But the question isn't just legal\u2014it's about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe ex's actions were wrong by sending unsolicited nudes, but that doesn't give the author the right to share them. Revenge or retaliation, even if it's in response to someone else's wrongdoing, can still be unethical. The author is using the photos to humiliate the ex, which can be seen as a form of cyberbullying or emotional harm. Even though only a few friends saw it, the act of sharing private content is a breach of trust and respect. The author's justification is that the ex tried to break them up, but that doesn't negate the harm caused by sharing the photos. The girlfriend's anger makes sense because it's a breach of privacy and could damage their relationship. The author might have acted out of hurt and a desire for revenge, but that doesn't make it right. So, putting this all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
