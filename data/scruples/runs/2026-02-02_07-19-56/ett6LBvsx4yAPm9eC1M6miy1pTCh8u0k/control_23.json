A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sharing their ex's nudes with friends. The situation is that the ex sent unsolicited nudes after the breakup, claiming the author asked for them, which led to the author's current girlfriend finding out. Then, at a party, the author sent those photos to two friends and made fun of them, which the girlfriend later found out and was upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal angle. In many places, sharing someone's intimate images without consent is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the ex sent them first, the act of redistributing them can still be a violation of privacy laws. So legally, the author might be in the wrong.\n\nEthically, even if the author feels justified due to the ex's cheating and the breakup, sharing private images is generally considered a breach of trust and can be seen as a form of revenge. The author's actions could be harming the ex's privacy and potentially causing emotional distress. The fact that the ex sent the nudes unsolicited doesn't give the author permission to share them. \n\nThe author mentions that they felt their actions were justified because the ex was trying to break up the current relationship. However, revenge often escalates conflicts and can damage existing relationships, which in this case, led to the girlfriend being angry. The author's justification might not hold water in terms of maintaining trust and respect in their current relationship.\n\nAlso, the author sent the photos to friends at a party, which could be seen as public shaming or humiliation, especially if others are aware it's the ex. Even if they didn't directly mock the ex, the context of making fun in front of friends implies a lack of respect for her privacy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the ex initiated the situation, the author's response was not appropriate. Sharing private images without consent is a violation, and the justification based on past grievances doesn't excuse the action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
