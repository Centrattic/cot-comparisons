A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who sent their ex's nudes to friends is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated for years. The person found out, went through depression, started a new relationship, and the ex tried to interfere by sending unsolicited nudes. The author told their new girlfriend about the cheating and the ex's attempt to break them up. Then, at a party, they sent those nudes to two close friends and made fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was angry, but the author thinks it's justified because the ex deserved it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex sent the nudes unsolicited, the author shared them without consent, and the context of past betrayal. But even if the ex started it, sharing someone's private photos without their permission is a violation of privacy. The fact that the ex cheated doesn't make sharing the photos okay. The author's action could be considered revenge, but that doesn't excuse the invasion of privacy. Even if the ex was trying to sabotage the relationship, the appropriate response would be to ignore or report the behavior, not retaliate by sharing private content. The author's friends saw the photos, which could cause further harm or embarrassment. The girlfriend's anger is understandable because trust is important in relationships, and sharing someone's private content is a serious breach. So, even if the ex was at fault, the author's actions were wrong.\n"
