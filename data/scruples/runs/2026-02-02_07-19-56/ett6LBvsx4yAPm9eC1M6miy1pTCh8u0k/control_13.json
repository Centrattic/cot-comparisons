A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and his ex were together for ten years, but she cheated on him. He got really depressed, then started a new relationship with a girl who helped him recover. The ex found out about the new relationship, sent him her nudes with a caption implying he asked for them. The author told his girlfriend about it, and she believed him. Later, at a party, he sent those photos to two close friends, making fun of the ex. The girlfriend found out and was angry. The author feels justified because he thinks the ex was trying to break them up.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is already problematic. However, the author then shared them with friends. Even if the ex initiated it, sharing someone's private photos without consent is a violation of their privacy. The fact that the author was angry and hurt doesn't make it okay. The act of sharing nudes, even in a small group, is a form of revenge and can be considered a privacy breach. The girlfriend's anger is understandable because it's a betrayal of trust and respect for the ex's privacy. Even if the ex was at fault for cheating and sending the photos, the author's action isn't justified. Revenge through sharing private images is not acceptable. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
