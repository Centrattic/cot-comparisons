A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to friends after she sent them to him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a long-term relationship, then found out the ex was cheating. He went through depression but then started a new relationship. The ex, trying to break them up, sent him nudes and pretended he asked for them. He told his current girlfriend, who believed him. Then, at a party, he sent the photos to two friends and made fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nSo, the main issue here is sharing someone else's private images without consent. Even if the ex sent the nudes first, the author's action of forwarding them is problematic. Legally, sharing nudes without consent is a violation of privacy. Ethically, it's about respecting others' privacy and not retaliating with humiliation.\n\nThe ex's action of sending the nudes unsolicited was wrong, but that doesn't justify the author sharing them. Revenge or retaliation doesn't make the action right. The author might feel wronged, but forwarding private photos, even to a few friends, causes harm and breaches trust. His current girlfriend being upset is understandable because it shows a lack of respect for boundaries, which affects their relationship.\n\nSo, even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's action is still wrong. The correct answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
