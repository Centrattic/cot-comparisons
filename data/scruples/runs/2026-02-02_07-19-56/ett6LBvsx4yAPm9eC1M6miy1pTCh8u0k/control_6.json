A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person had a 10-year relationship with an ex who cheated. After breaking up, the ex sends unsolicited nudes to the author, claiming they were photos he asked for. The author tells his current girlfriend about the situation, and then later sends those nudes to two friends at a party, making fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was upset, thinking the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The ex sent unsolicited nudes, which is a violation of privacy and trust. But the author's response was to share those photos with friends. Even though the ex did something wrong, sharing someone else's private images without their consent is generally considered wrong. It's important to note that retaliating with someone else's private content, even if they were the initial wrongdoer, can be seen as a form of revenge and may further harm the relationship with the current partner.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is upset because he shared the photos. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and sharing private photos, even if it's an ex, can breach that trust. The author might have thought it was justified because the ex was trying to break them up, but actions have consequences. The friends who received the photos might not have been the issue, but the fact that the author involved others and made fun of the ex in this way could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author's mental state after the cheating and depression is a factor, but that doesn't excuse sharing private images. People dealing with trauma might act out, but it's still important to consider the impact of their actions on others. The current relationship is in jeopardy because of this action, and the girlfriend's trust in the author's judgment could be damaged.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, so the author didn't have permission to share them. Even if the ex was trying to be malicious, sharing the photos without consent is a violation. The author might think they were defending their current relationship, but the method was inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, while the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response of sharing private photos is ethically questionable. The key points are the violation of privacy, the impact on the current relationship, and the lack of consent in sharing the photos. So the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
