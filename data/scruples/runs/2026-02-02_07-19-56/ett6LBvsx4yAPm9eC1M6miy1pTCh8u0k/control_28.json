A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about sending ex-girlfriend's nude photos to friends after a breakup. The ex cheated for years, and the person sent the photos to friends as a joke when the ex was at a party.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, claiming the person asked for them. The person told their current girlfriend about the situation, and she believed it was an attempt to break them up. Then, the person shared the nudes with friends, making fun of them but not directly at the ex. The girlfriend found out and was angry, and the person feels justified because of the ex's cheating.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The main issue is sharing someone's private photos without consent. Even if the ex sent them first, that doesn't give the person the right to distribute them. The ex's actions were wrong, but the person's response is also problematic. Revenge or sharing private content is typically frowned upon, regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the person sent the photos to friends when the ex was present at the party. That adds another layer because even if others didn't see the photos, the act of sharing them in that context could be seen as malicious. The person's justification is that the ex deserved it, but that doesn't negate the invasion of privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because sharing nudes, even as a joke, breaches trust and is disrespectful. It's important to consider that the ex's initial action (sending nudes) was also wrong, but the person's action in sharing them is still the wrong thing to do. \n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because sharing private content without consent is unethical, even if the person feels they were wronged first. The harm caused to the ex is significant, and using her private photos for mockery is not justified.\n"
