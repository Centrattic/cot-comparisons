A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about sending an ex's unsolicited nude photos to friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The person and their ex were together for ten years, but the ex cheated. The author found out and went through a tough time. Now in a new relationship, the ex sends nudes with a misleading caption to try to sabotage the new relationship. The author tells their girlfriend, who believes them. Then, at a party, the author shares the photos with two close friends, making fun of the ex indirectly. The girlfriend finds out and is upset, but the author thinks it's justified because the ex tried to break them up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: sharing private nudes without consent, even if the ex initiated it. The author's actions could be seen as retaliatory. Even though the ex sent the photos, the author is still violating their privacy by distributing them. The fact that the ex is trying to be malicious doesn't make sharing the photos okay. The author's justification is based on retaliation, but that doesn't negate the harm caused. The girlfriend is upset because sharing private content is a breach of trust and respect, even if it's an ex. Also, the friends only saw the photos because the author shared them, so the author is responsible for that spread. \n\nLegal implications aside, the ethical standpoint is that sharing someone's private images without their consent is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The author might feel justified, but the action itself is a violation of privacy and respect. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's an invasion of her partner's boundaries and could reflect poorly on the author's character. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
