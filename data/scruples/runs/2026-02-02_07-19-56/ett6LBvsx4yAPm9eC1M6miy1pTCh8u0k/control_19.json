A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for sharing their ex's nudes with friends.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a 10-year relationship that ended because the ex cheated. After the breakup, the ex sent unsolicited nudes to the author, trying to sabotage the new relationship. The author showed the photos to friends at a party, making fun of them. The girlfriend found out and is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is sharing someone else's private, explicit photos without their consent. Even if the ex sent them unsolicited, that doesn't give the author the right to distribute them. The ex's actions were wrong, but retaliating by sharing the photos is also a violation of privacy. The author might feel justified because of the cheating, but the act of sharing nudes is a separate legal and ethical issue. It could be considered a breach of trust and could harm the ex further, even if they were at fault. Also, the girlfriend is upset because the author shared something private, which could damage their current relationship. So, even though the ex initiated the situation, the author's action is still wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
