A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing unsolicited nudes from their ex-girlfriend with friends. So first, I need to consider the situation.\n\nThe author and ex were together for ten years, then the ex cheated. The author went through depression but found a new girlfriend. The ex sent nudes after the breakup, claiming the author asked for them. The author told their new girlfriend, who believed them. Later, the author shared those photos at a party with friends, making fun of them. The new girlfriend found out and was angry. The author thinks it's justified because the ex tried to break them up.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: the ex sent the nudes first, the author shared them without consent. Even if the ex was trying to sabotage, sharing private photos is a violation of privacy. The author might feel wronged, but that doesn't make sharing the photos okay. Legally, sending someone else's nudes without permission is a problem. Also, ethically, it's about respecting someone's privacy, even if they've done something wrong. The author's girlfriend is upset because of the trust issue and the act of sharing intimate images. Even if it's mutual friends, it's still a breach. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
