A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person was in a 10-year relationship that ended because the ex cheated. After the breakup, the ex sent unsolicited nudes to the author, pretending the author had asked for them. The author told their current girlfriend about the cheating ex trying to break them up. Then, at a mutual friend's party, the author sent those photos to two close friends and made fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was angry. The author thinks it was justified because the ex deserved it.\n\nHmm. The main question is about sharing someone else's private photos without their consent. Even if the ex sent them unsolicited, the author is still sharing private images that were never meant to be distributed. The ex's actions were inappropriate, but that doesn't give the author the right to retaliate by sharing them. It's a violation of privacy, regardless of the context. The author might have felt justified due to the cheating, but revenge or retaliation isn't a valid reason to share someone's nudes. The friends only saw them because the author shared them, which is a breach of privacy. The girlfriend being angry makes sense because it's a breach of trust and respect. So, the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
