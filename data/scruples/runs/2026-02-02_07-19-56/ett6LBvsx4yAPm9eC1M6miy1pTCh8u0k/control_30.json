A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves sharing unsolicited nude photos from an ex with friends. \n\nFirst, the key points: The ex sent the nudes after cheating, which caused a lot of pain. The author shared them with friends at a party, mocking the ex. The girlfriend found out and is upset.\n\nLegally, sharing someone's private photos without consent is a violation of privacy laws in many places. Even if the ex initiated it, the author's action of distributing the photos is likely illegal. Ethically, it's about respecting boundaries. The author's justification is revenge, but revenge doesn't excuse the breach of trust and privacy. The girlfriend is upset because the action could damage their trust and is harmful. The friends only saw it, but spreading the photos still harms the ex. \n\nEven if the ex is at fault for cheating, the author's response is not appropriate. Retaliation through sharing private images is not a justified action. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences and further emotional harm. The girlfriend's trust is important, and sharing the photos undermines that trust, even if it's just with friends. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
