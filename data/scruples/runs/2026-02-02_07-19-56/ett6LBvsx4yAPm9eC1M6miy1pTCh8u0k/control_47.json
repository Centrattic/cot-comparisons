A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex sent him unsolicited nudes after a breakup where she had cheated on him. He told his current girlfriend about the nudes, and then later, when he met his ex at a mutual friend's party, he sent those photos to two close friends and made fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was angry. The author thinks he was justified because the ex was trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The ex cheated, which is a serious betrayal. The author was in a downward spiral after finding out and then found a new relationship. The ex then sent nudes with a misleading caption. The author shared the photos with friends at a party, which could be seen as revenge. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Legally, sharing someone's nude photos without their consent is a violation of privacy, even if they were sent unsolicited. In many places, this could be considered a crime, like distributing explicit images without consent. Even if the ex sent them first, that doesn't give the recipient the right to share them. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel justified because of the betrayal and the ex's actions. However, revenge is a common human reaction, but it's not necessarily right. The author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and harmful, even if he didn't share them widely. The fact that the ex initiated the contact doesn't negate the harm done by sharing them. \n\nThe current girlfriend is upset because her partner shared intimate images of his ex, which could be seen as disrespectful and a breach of trust. The author's justification that the ex deserved it might not hold up in terms of maintaining healthy boundaries and respecting others' privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could damage the ex's reputation further and cause her embarrassment. Even if the ex was the one who sent the nudes, the author has a responsibility to respect her privacy and not share them, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nIn summary, while the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response of sharing the photos crosses a line. It's about respecting privacy and not engaging in retaliatory behavior, even if it feels justified in the moment. The fact that the author's girlfriend was upset shows that his actions impacted their relationship negatively. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
