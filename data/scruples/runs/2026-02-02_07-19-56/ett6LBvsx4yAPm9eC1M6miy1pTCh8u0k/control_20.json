A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves sharing nude photos that an ex sent unsolicited after a breakup, and then sending those photos to friends to mock the ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex cheated for years, the author was deeply affected, started a new relationship, and the ex sent nudes pretending the author had asked for them. The author told his girlfriend, who believed him. Then at a party, he sent the photos to friends to mock the ex, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main issue here is sharing someone else's private images without consent, even if it's for revenge. Legally, distributing nude photos without consent is a violation of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the ex sent them first, forwarding them is still sharing without their permission. The author's justification is revenge for the ex's actions, but that doesn't make it right. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend being upset suggests that this action might have breached trust in their current relationship. The friends might not have the right to view those photos either, so the author's action affects others beyond just the ex. \n\nEven if the ex initiated by sending the photos, the author's decision to retaliate by sharing them is problematic. It's a cycle of revenge that can lead to further conflict and potential legal consequences. The author might think it's justified, but from a moral and legal standpoint, sharing private images without consent is wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because sharing someone's private content without consent is unethical and potentially illegal, regardless of the context.\n"
