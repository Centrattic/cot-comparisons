A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sharing their ex's nudes with friends. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex were together for ten years, then the ex cheated. The author went through a tough time, found a new girlfriend, but the ex sent unsolicited nudes to the author, claiming it was something the author asked for. The author told their new girlfriend about it, and then at a party, shared the photos with two close friends, making fun of the ex. The girlfriend found out and was upset. The author feels justified because the ex tried to break them up.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the ex sent nudes unsolicited, which is a violation of privacy. The author shared them without consent, even if it was among friends. Even if the ex did something wrong, sharing her private photos is a form of retaliation that's not acceptable. It's about respecting others' privacy, regardless of past actions. The author might feel hurt, but that doesn't give them the right to do the same. Also, making fun of someone's photos, even if they were sent by someone else, is unkind and could be considered cyberbullying or revenge. The girlfriend being upset makes sense because sharing private images is a serious breach of trust and respect. So even though the ex was at fault, the author's actions are still wrong because they crossed a line by sharing private content. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
