A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by sharing their ex's unsolicited nudes with friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex were together for ten years. The ex cheated, which led to a breakup and the author's depression. Then they started a new relationship, but the ex sent nudes pretending the author asked for them. The author told their current girlfriend, who believed them. Later, at a party, the author sent the photos to two friends to mock the ex, thinking it was justified because the ex tried to break them up.\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The ex sent the photos unsolicited, which is already a problem. The author shared them without consent, even if it was to friends. Even if the ex is at fault for cheating and sending the nudes, sharing someone else's private photos without their permission is a violation of their privacy. It's not just about retaliation; it's about respecting boundaries. The author might feel justified, but revenge doesn't make the action right. The friends only saw the photos because the author shared them, which could cause further issues for the ex, even if they were in the wrong. The current girlfriend being upset shows that this action had real consequences in the author's current relationship. So, even if the ex initiated the situation, the author's actions were wrong. The right choice would have been to delete the photos or not engage in sharing them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
