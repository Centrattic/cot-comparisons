A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who sent their ex's unsolicited nudes to friends is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated for years. The author was deeply affected, went through depression, and then started a new relationship. The ex then sent nudes, claiming the author asked for them. The author told his girlfriend, who believed him. Then, at a party, he sent the photos to two friends and made fun of them, which the girlfriend found out and was upset.\n\nSo, legally, sharing someone's explicit photos without consent is a crime in many places. Even if the ex sent them first, distributing them without permission is problematic. The author might think it's justified because of the cheating, but that doesn't make it right. Revenge isn't a valid reason to break the law or violate someone's privacy. Ethically, sharing someone's private photos, even if they're an ex, is wrong. It could cause further harm and is disrespectful. The girlfriend's anger makes sense because it's a breach of trust and could damage their current relationship. The author's actions might be seen as retaliatory and not justified, even if he feels wronged. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
