A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's nudes to friends. The situation is pretty complex. So, they were in a 10-year relationship, she cheated, he broke down, then got with a new girlfriend. The ex sent unsolicited nudes to him, pretending he asked for them. He told his girlfriend, who believed he was targeted. Then at a party, he sent those photos to two friends and made fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is a privacy violation on her part. But the author sent them to friends, which is another privacy violation. Even though the ex initiated it, the author's action of sharing them is still a breach. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nHe says he did it because she tried to break them up. But does that make it okay? Even if someone does something wrong, you can't retaliate by doing something illegal or unethical yourself. Sharing someone's private photos without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the circumstances. It's a form of revenge, which might be understandable in his anger, but legally and morally, it's on him. The fact that only three people saw it might mitigate some of the harm, but the act itself is still wrong. The girlfriend being upset makes sense because trust is important. So overall, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
