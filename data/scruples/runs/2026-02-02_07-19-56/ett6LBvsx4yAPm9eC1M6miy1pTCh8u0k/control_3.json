A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their ex's nudes to friends. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author was in a long-term relationship that ended because the ex cheated. After the breakup, the ex sends unsolicited nudes, claiming it's what the author asked for. The author tells his new girlfriend about it, and then later shares the photos with friends at a party to make fun of the ex. The girlfriend found out and is upset.\n\nSo, the main points here are: sharing someone else's private content without consent, even if the content was sent unsolicited, might still be wrong. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, but sharing them, even with friends, could be considered a violation of privacy. The author might think it's justified because the ex cheated and tried to sabotage the new relationship, but revenge doesn't make it right legally or ethically.\n\nLegally, sharing someone's nudes without consent is often a crime, regardless of the circumstances. Ethically, it's about respecting boundaries. Even if the ex sent the photos first, the author has a responsibility not to distribute them. The fact that the ex intended to hurt might mitigate some judgment, but it doesn't negate the action's wrongness.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he broke trust by sharing her ex's photos, even if it's the ex's fault. So, in terms of the relationship, it's a breach of trust. The author might not see it as wrong because he felt wronged, but from a societal standpoint, sharing private content is wrong regardless of the reason. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
