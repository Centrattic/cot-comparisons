A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who sent their ex's unsolicited nudes to friends is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person had a 10-year relationship that ended because the ex cheated. The person went through depression but found a new girlfriend. The ex then sent nudes with a caption implying the person had asked for them. The person told their new girlfriend, who believed them. Later, at a party, the person shared those nudes with two friends, making fun of the photo without directly mentioning the ex. The new girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is sharing someone else's private photos without consent, even if that person was an ex and even if they sent them unsolicited. \n\nUnder the law, sharing someone's intimate photos without their consent is a violation in many places, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the ex sent them first, that doesn't give the recipient the right to distribute them. The act of sharing can be considered revenge or retaliation, which still doesn't make it legal or ethically acceptable. \n\nThe author might feel justified because the ex tried to break their new relationship, but revenge through sharing private images is a breach of privacy and trust. The new girlfriend's anger makes sense because it's a betrayal of their trust, even if the author felt it was justified. \n\nEthically, it's about respecting others' privacy. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's action crosses a line. It could lead to legal consequences like revenge porn charges. Also, sharing the photos in a group setting, even among friends, could harm the ex's reputation and well-being. \n\nSo, even though the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response is still inappropriate. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
