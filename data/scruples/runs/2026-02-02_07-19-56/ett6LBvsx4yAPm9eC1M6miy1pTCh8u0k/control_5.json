A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their ex's unsolicited nude photos to friends. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 10-year relationship, then found out the ex cheated. The author went through depression for six months before moving on with a new girlfriend. The ex sent nudes after the breakup, claiming the author asked for them. The author told their current girlfriend, who believed them. Then, at a mutual friend's party, the author shared the photos with two close friends and made fun of them, but no one else saw. The current girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether sharing the ex's nudes, even if done in private, is justified. Legally, sharing someone's explicit photos without consent is a violation of their privacy and can be considered harassment or even a criminal act in some places. Ethically, it's about respecting another person's dignity and boundaries. Even though the ex might have been manipulative, taking revenge by distributing her photos crosses a line. It's not just about the action itself but also the potential harm. The ex might feel violated again, and it could affect their reputation or mental health. The current girlfriend's anger is understandable because sharing such content can be seen as disrespectful and could lead to trust issues. The author believes it was justified because the ex tried to break them up, but that doesn't make the action right. Revenge doesn't equate to justice in relationships. Also, the friends might have shared the photos further, even if it wasn't intended, which could cause more problems. So, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
