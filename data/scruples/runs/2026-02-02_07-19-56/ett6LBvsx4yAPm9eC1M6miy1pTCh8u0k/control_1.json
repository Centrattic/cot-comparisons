A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's nudes to friends. So, let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex were together for ten years. She cheated, which caused him a lot of pain. Then he started a new relationship, but his ex found out and sent unsolicited nudes, trying to mess with him. He showed the photos to his girlfriend and she believed him. Later, at a mutual friend's party, he shared the nudes with two friends, making fun of her, but not directly. The girlfriend found out and got angry.\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is inappropriate. The author then shared them without her consent. Even if it was a form of retaliation, sharing someone's private photos without permission is generally considered wrong. It's a violation of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that the ex might have acted wrongly doesn't justify the author's actions. Retaliation doesn't make something right. Also, the author's new girlfriend is upset, which shows that his actions had negative consequences on his current relationship. Even if he felt justified, the act of sharing private images is unethical and illegal in many places. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
