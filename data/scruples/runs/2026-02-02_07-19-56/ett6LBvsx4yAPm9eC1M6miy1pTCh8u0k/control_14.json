A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex sent nudes to the author after their breakup, which was unsolicited. The author then shared those nudes with friends at a party, making fun of them. The girlfriend found out and is upset. The author thinks it's justified because the ex cheated and tried to break up the new relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is a violation of privacy. By sending them to friends, the author is sharing private content without consent. Even if the ex was a cheater, that doesn't make sharing the images acceptable. The author's actions could be considered revenge, but revenge doesn't excuse violating someone's privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the ex tried to break up the new relationship. However, the appropriate response would be to block the ex or seek support, not to retaliate by sharing private photos. Sharing explicit images, even if the person is an ex, is a breach of trust and could lead to legal consequences in many places. \n\nThe girlfriend's anger is understandable because the author shared something private, which could have led to further harm or public embarrassment for the ex. The author's friends seeing the photos might not seem like a big deal, but it's still a violation. The author's actions, while perhaps a reaction to hurt, are not justified. \n\nSo, even though the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response crosses a line. Privacy is important, and sharing someone else's nudes is a clear violation regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
