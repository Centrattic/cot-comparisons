A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to friends. The author's ex cheated on him for years, and after he started a new relationship, the ex sent him nudes with a fake caption to try to break them up. The author then shared those photos with friends at a party, making fun of them.\n\nFirst, even if the ex was at fault, sharing someone's private photos without consent is generally considered wrong. It's a violation of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. The author's action could be seen as retaliatory, but that doesn't justify the act. Retaliation doesn't make something right. The ex sent the photos unsolicited, but the author then used them to humiliate her further. That could hurt the ex and damage their reputation, even if they were in the wrong before.\n\nThe author's girlfriend was upset, which shows that this action might have affected their current relationship. Trust is important, and sharing such intimate images can be a breach of trust, even if it's not directed at the girlfriend. Also, even if only a few people saw the photos, it's still a privacy violation. The author might think he was justified, but the act itself is unethical and potentially illegal in some places. So, even though the ex had a history of cheating and trying to sabotage, the author's response crosses a line. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
