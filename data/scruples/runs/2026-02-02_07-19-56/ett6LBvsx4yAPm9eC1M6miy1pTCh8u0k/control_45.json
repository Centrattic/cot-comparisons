A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who sent their ex's nude photos to friends is in the wrong. The situation is complex, so I need to consider both legal and ethical angles.\n\nFirst, the ex sent the nudes unsolicited after the breakup. The person received them and then shared them with friends. Legally, sharing someone's nude photos without their consent is a violation of privacy and could be considered a crime in many jurisdictions. Even if the ex tried to break things up, that doesn't give the recipient the right to retaliate by distributing private images.\n\nEthically, the person might feel justified because of the betrayal, but revenge doesn't absolve the action. The key point is consent. The ex didn't ask for the photos to be shared, and doing so, even among a small group, is a misuse of trust and can cause further harm. The fact that the person's current girlfriend was upset suggests that this action damaged trust in their new relationship as well.\n\nAlso, making fun of the photos, even if not directly naming the ex, is still mocking someone's private content. The argument that it was a justified revenge doesn't hold up because it's not a legal or socially acceptable form of retribution. People should seek other ways to address betrayal without engaging in harmful behavior.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical standards, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
