A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing his ex's nudes with friends. The context is that the ex cheated, he was hurt, then the ex sent nudes unsolicited to try to break up the new relationship. He showed them to friends, not directly making fun but implying. The girlfriend found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, consent is key. The ex sent the photos unsolicited, so sharing them without her permission is a violation. Even if he felt justified, distributing private images is a breach of privacy and trust. The ex's actions were wrong, but that doesn't give him the right to retaliate in kind. Revenge doesn't make the action right. Plus, sharing nudes is illegal in many places and can be considered harassment. The girlfriend's reaction makes sense because it's a serious breach of trust. So, yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
