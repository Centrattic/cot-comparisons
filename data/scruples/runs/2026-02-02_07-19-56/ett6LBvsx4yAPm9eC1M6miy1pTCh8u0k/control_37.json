A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by sharing his ex-girlfriend's unsolicited nudes with friends after she tried to sabotage his new relationship.\n\nFirst, the ex sent the nudes unsolicited, captioning it as if the author had asked for them. He told his current girlfriend, who believed he was being truthful. Then, at a party, he sent the photos to two close friends and made fun of them, but no one else saw it. The key points here are consent and intent. \n\nThe ex sent the photos without his permission, but by sharing them with friends, the author is now using those images without her consent. Even if she intended to harm his relationship, that doesn't justify him sharing her private photos. Revenge or retaliation isn't a valid excuse here. \n\nAlso, sharing intimate images without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that he did it in front of friends and mocked the ex, even if indirectly, could be seen as malicious. The girlfriend being upset makes sense because he violated trust by sharing private content, even if he felt justified. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable in the context of betrayal, are still a breach of privacy and could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
