A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sharing nudes sent by an ex. The situation is that the ex cheated for years, which led to the author's depression. The author got a new relationship, and the ex sent unsolicited nudes to try to break them up. The author showed the photos to friends at a party, making fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was upset, but the author thinks it's justified because the ex was trying to sabotage their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is a violation of consent. The author shared them with friends, which is a breach of privacy. Even if the ex sent them first, sharing private photos without permission is generally wrong. The author's justification is revenge, but revenge doesn't make the action right. The fact that they were exes doesn't negate the privacy issue. The girlfriend's anger is a result of the action, which further complicates things because it affects the current relationship. Legal and ethical standards usually consider sharing someone's private photos without consent as wrong, regardless of the circumstances. So even though the author had a bad experience, the action of sharing the photos is unethical and potentially illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
