A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sent their ex's unsolicited nudes to friends is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the ex cheated, leading to a breakup. The ex then sent nudes to the author, claiming the author asked for them. The author told their new girlfriend about it, and later shared the photos with friends at a party, making fun of the ex. The new girlfriend is upset now.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is sharing someone's private photos without consent. Even if the ex sent them unsolicited, the author is still distributing them, which is a violation of privacy. The author's reasoning is that the ex deserved it for trying to break them up, but revenge doesn't justify the action. Legally, sharing nudes without consent can be considered a crime in many places, regardless of the context. Emotionally, the author might feel justified, but ethically, it's a breach of trust and respect. The ex's actions were wrong, but that doesn't give the author the right to retaliate in a way that could further harm the ex and damage their current relationship. The new girlfriend's anger is a consequence of the author's actions, which could indicate wrongdoing. So, the answer is A.\n"
