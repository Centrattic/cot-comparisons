A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who sent their ex's nudes to friends after a breakup is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 10-year relationship where the ex cheated. The author went through a tough time, got into a new relationship, and then the ex sent unsolicited nudes. The author showed the photos to their current girlfriend and then later sent them to friends at a party to mock the ex. The girlfriend is upset about this.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is already a red flag. The author shared them with friends, even if it was in a private group. Even if the ex is the one who initiated the contact, sharing someone else's private photos without consent is generally considered wrong. It's a violation of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that the ex had a history of trying to reunite with the author might add context, but it doesn't justify sharing the nudes. The author's actions could be seen as retaliation, but that doesn't make it right. The current girlfriend is upset, which shows that the action affected the current relationship. So, even if the ex did something wrong, sharing private images is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
