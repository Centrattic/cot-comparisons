A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending his ex's unsolicited nudes to friends. The ex sent the nudes after the breakup, trying to disrupt his new relationship. He showed them to friends at a party, making fun of the photos. The girlfriend found out and was upset.\n\nFirst, legality: Sharing someone's nudes without consent is illegal in many places. Even if the ex sent them unsolicited, the author didn't have the right to distribute them. Privacy is a key issue here. The ex might have been trying to provoke, but that doesn't negate the violation of her privacy.\n\nThen, ethics. Revenge isn't a valid justification for unethical behavior. Even if the ex cheated and caused harm, retaliating by sharing private photos is a low point. It's about respecting others' dignity regardless of past actions.\n\nImpact on the current relationship: The girlfriend was angry because he broke trust. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and sharing someone else's private stuff can be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if the ex initiated it, the action could make the girlfriend feel insecure or question his judgment.\n\nIntent vs. action: The author's intent was to mock the ex, but the action harmed multiple people\u2014his ex, his friends (if they were uncomfortable), and his girlfriend. The ends don't justify the means here. Retaliation often causes more harm than good.\n\nPossible consequences: The ex could take legal action for distributing nudes, leading to legal troubles. Friends might feel pressured or embarrassed. The author's new relationship could suffer, which it already has. He might regret acting out of anger.\n\nAlternatives: He could have addressed the situation by ignoring the ex's provocation, confronting her directly without sharing photos, or talking to a friend about the issue without involving others. Maybe seeking support through therapy instead of lashing out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the ex acted poorly, the author's response was not justified. He violated her privacy and harmed his current relationship. The answer should be A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
