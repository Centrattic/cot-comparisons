A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person was in a 10-year relationship that ended because his ex cheated. He was really hurt and went through depression until a new girlfriend helped him recover. Then, his ex sent unsolicited nudes with a caption implying she was giving him photos he asked for. He told his girlfriend about it, and she believed he was being truthful. Later, at a party with mutual friends, he sent the nudes to two close friends and made fun of the photos. Only they saw it, and he didn't directly mock her, but it was obvious. His girlfriend got angry, and he thinks he was justified because the ex was trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, the ex sending unsolicited nudes is definitely problematic. She shouldn't have sent them, especially with a manipulative message. But the author's response? He shared her private images without her consent, even if it was among friends. Legally, sharing someone's nudes without permission is a violation of privacy and could be illegal in many places. Ethically, it's a breach of trust and respect. Even if he feels wronged, retaliating with her private photos is not the right approach. The ex's actions were wrong, but that doesn't justify him doing the same. The author's actions could further harm the situation, make him look like the aggressor, and potentially damage his new relationship. The girlfriend was upset because he shared someone's private images, which is a valid reaction. So even if he felt justified, the act of sharing the nudes was wrong. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
