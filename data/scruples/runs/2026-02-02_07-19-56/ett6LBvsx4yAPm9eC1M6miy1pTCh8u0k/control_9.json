A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he sent his ex's unsolicited nude photos to his friends after she sent them to him with a misleading caption. The ex had cheated on him, and he's now in a new relationship. His girlfriend found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, which is a privacy violation. But then the author shared them further, even though he didn't ask for them. Even if the ex initiated it, sharing someone's private photos without their consent is generally wrong, regardless of past issues. The author's friends saw them, and they made fun of the photos, which could be seen as bullying or retaliation. The girlfriend is upset because he shared her ex's private content, which might damage their relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the ex deserved it for trying to break them up. But revenge or retaliation doesn't make the action right. Even if someone does something wrong, retaliating with their private information is illegal in many places and considered unethical. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences for distributing nudes, which is a violation of privacy laws. \n\nMoreover, the author's girlfriend trusted him, and sharing the photos might have broken that trust. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's decision to share the photos wasn't justified. It's important to handle conflicts without escalating them into further violations. The fact that the author took the photos to a party and showed them to friends makes it worse because it's public shaming, which is harmful and disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions were wrong. He shouldn't have shared the photos, even if the ex sent them first. The justification based on revenge doesn't hold up under ethical or legal standards. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
