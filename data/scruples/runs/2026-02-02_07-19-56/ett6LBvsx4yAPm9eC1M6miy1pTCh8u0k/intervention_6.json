A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a ten-year relationship that ended because his ex cheated. He was really hurt and depressed, then started a new relationship with someone who helped him recover. The ex then sent him unsolicited nudes, pretending he asked for them, which was meant to sabotage his new relationship. He told his girlfriend, who believed him. Then, at a mutual friend's party, he sent those nudes to two friends and made fun of them, but not directly at her. The girlfriend found out and was angry.\n\nNow, the author thinks he was justified because his ex was trying to break them up. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, sharing someone's private photos without consent is a big issue. Even if the ex sent them unsolicited, sending them to others is a violation of privacy. The author might feel justified, but the act itself is typically considered wrong. Revenge doesn't make it right. Also, he shared them with friends, which could be seen as malicious and could harm the ex's reputation. The girlfriend being angry makes sense because sharing private content is a breach of trust and respect. \n\nBut there's context: the ex was trying to sabotage their relationship. However, retaliating with her nudes is problematic. The author could have handled it differently, like ignoring the photos or confronting the ex. Sharing them, even in a small group, is still unethical and potentially illegal in some places. So, even if the ex was at fault, the author's action isn't justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
