A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author was in a long-term relationship that ended because the ex cheated. The author then started a new relationship and the ex sent unsolicited nudes to the author, trying to cause trouble. The author shared those photos with friends at a party, making fun of them. The girlfriend found out and was upset. The author's reasoning is that the ex deserved it for trying to break them up.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are consent, respect, and intent. The ex sent the photos unsolicited, which is already problematic. The author received them and then shared them with friends. Even if the author felt justified, sharing someone's private images without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The fact that the ex might have been trying to cause trouble doesn't change the fact that sharing those images is a breach of trust and could be considered revenge. \n\nAlso, the author's girlfriend is upset because of this action. Even if the author thinks it's justified, the action affects the current relationship. Revenge or retaliation, even if motivated by hurt, can cause harm. The friends only saw the photos through the author's sharing, which could lead to further spread or misuse. \n\nSo, even though the ex's actions were bad, the author's response is not acceptable. The right to privacy is still there regardless of past actions. The author's action is a form of revenge and crosses a line by sharing private content. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
