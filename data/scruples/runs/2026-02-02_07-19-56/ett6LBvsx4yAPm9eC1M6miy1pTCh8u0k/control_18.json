A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying \u2018Here are the photos you asked me for\u2019. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.\n\nFew days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn\u2019t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.\n\nWhen my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by sharing their ex's nudes with friends. The situation starts with the ex cheating and then sending unsolicited nudes after the breakup. The author tells their current girlfriend and then later shares the photos with friends at a party, making fun of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, sharing someone's intimate photos without their consent is illegal, even if they sent them to you first. The ex sent the nudes unsolicited, so the author didn't ask for them. That might not matter legally because once you have them, sharing them can still be a violation. So the author is probably breaking the law here.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The ex had a history of trying to sabotage the author's current relationship, which the author's girlfriend believed. But even if the ex is acting maliciously, sharing private photos isn't justified. It's a form of revenge that harms others. The author's action could affect the ex's reputation and emotional well-being. Also, the author's girlfriend is upset because of this, which shows that it's affecting their relationship negatively.\n\nThe author might think they were justified because the ex started it, but that's not a valid excuse. Retaliation doesn't make the action right. The author should have considered the potential consequences for everyone involved. Even if the ex is at fault, sharing the photos is a violation of privacy and trust.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friends who saw the photos. They might have been uncomfortable or could share them further without the author's knowledge, leading to more harm. The author's decision to share the photos publicly, even among friends, breaches the ex's privacy and could be seen as cruel.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are key. The author's action could make the current girlfriend question their judgment, which is why she's upset. The author might need to apologize and take steps to mitigate the damage, like deleting the photos and not sharing them further.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
