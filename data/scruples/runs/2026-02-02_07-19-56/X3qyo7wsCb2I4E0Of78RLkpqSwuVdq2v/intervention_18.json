Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple deciding whether the wife should use her married name on her doctoral certificate. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been through a lot together during her schooling, and he wants recognition of their shared sacrifices. The wife, on the other hand, wants to keep her maiden name on the certificate, arguing that she took on most of the tuition costs and the work while attending school full time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around this. In many cultures, people change their names to their spouse's after marriage, especially for professional recognition. But there's also a growing trend where individuals, especially in academia, choose to keep their maiden names for their degrees, especially if they were earned before or during the marriage. The husband's concern is about others perceiving the name change as happening after the achievement, which might imply that the marriage came later. But maybe the wife has her reasons for wanting her maiden name, like it's part of her professional identity or she wants to maintain her family's legacy.\n\nThen there's the aspect of sacrifice and support. The husband mentions that he's older, has a higher income, and they primarily live on his earnings. He also takes on more housework so she can focus. He's trying to highlight the shared effort. The wife says she's working full time and paying for most of her tuition, so she feels the name should be hers. It's possible that the husband is conflating the use of the married name with shared credit, but the certificate is a personal achievement. The name on the certificate is about the person who earned the degree, not necessarily the spouse's contribution, even though the spouse did support them.\n\nThe husband's feeling of betrayal is emotional. He might feel that not using the married name undermines their partnership. However, the wife's request is about her personal identity and the recognition of her own work. If she's paying for most of her tuition and working full time, it's her name and her achievement. The husband's sacrifices are important, but the certificate is a formal document that typically reflects the individual's academic journey. \n\nAnother angle: legal and administrative possibilities. The question is whether it's possible to have the married name on the certificate. If the school allows name changes after graduation, maybe they can update it. If not, perhaps the wife can get a corrected certificate later. The husband's main issue seems to be about perception rather than actual fact. He wants the certificate to reflect their unity to avoid others misunderstanding when they got married. But the wife might see it as her personal milestone and want to retain her maiden name for consistency in her professional documents.\n\nThere's also the point about the couple being happy and in a long marriage, just having a debate. The husband's desire for joint recognition is valid, but the wife's autonomy in choosing her name is also important. In many cases, the name on the certificate is the name the student used during their studies. If she was using her maiden name then, it might be standard to keep it. However, if they were married before or during her studies, maybe the school allows the married name. The key here is understanding the policies and the wife's personal choice.\n\nSo, the husband is not necessarily wrong for feeling that way, but is he in the wrong for expecting her to use the married name? Since the certificate is a personal achievement, and the wife has her reasons, maybe the husband is overstepping by expecting her to change her name. The wife's autonomy and the fact that she's paying for her own tuition might mean that the certificate should reflect her name as she chooses. The husband's sacrifices are part of their marriage, but the certificate is about her academic identity. Therefore, the author (husband) might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice, but maybe it's a matter of differing perspectives. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that the certificate is a personal document and she's making the choice based on her contributions, the answer might be A, but I'm not sure.\n"
