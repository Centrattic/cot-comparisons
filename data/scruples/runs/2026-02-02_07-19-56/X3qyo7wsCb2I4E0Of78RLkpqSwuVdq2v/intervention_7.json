Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate might give the impression that they married after she earned her degree, which he sees as a lack of recognition for their shared sacrifices. He emphasizes that they've been married through most of her education, and he's supported her financially and with housework.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she works full-time and attends school full-time, has paid for most of her tuition, and since he didn't attend classes with her, she deserves the recognition under her family's name. They mention they have a happy marriage and it's more of a debate than a fight.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal rights. In many places, individuals can choose the name they publish on their academic credentials. It's a personal choice and often a matter of identity. The wife's desire to use her maiden name for pride in her family's name is a valid reason. Her argument is about her own contributions and recognition. \n\nThe husband's concern about others perceiving the marriage's timeline is more about social perception, which might not be the wife's primary concern. However, the core of the issue is about mutual respect and compromise. The husband is asking his wife to make a symbolic gesture for their unity, while she might see her name choice as a personal right. \n\nMarriage involves shared values, but personal achievements are also individual. The wife's academic title is her own accomplishment, even if they supported each other. However, the husband's feelings about unity are understandable. The key here is whether forcing her to use a married name is a reasonable request. \n\nIn many cases, names on academic certificates are a personal choice, and pressuring someone to change it could be seen as disregarding their autonomy. The husband's argument hinges on the idea that they \"did this together,\" but the wife's perspective is that she earned it, so her choice of name is hers to make. \n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he's expecting his wife to alter her professional identity to fit his perception of their partnership. It's about respecting her individuality and the right to choose her name on her certificate. The wife's stance is about her own pride and heritage, which are important personal factors.\n"
