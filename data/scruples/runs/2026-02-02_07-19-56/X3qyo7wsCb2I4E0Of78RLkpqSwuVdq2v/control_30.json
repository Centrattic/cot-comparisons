Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife wanting to put her maiden name on her doctoral certificate instead of the married name they use together. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've both sacrificed a lot during her education. The wife argues she paid for most of her tuition and deserves recognition under her family's name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. In many societies, people choose to use their maiden name professionally for various reasons, especially if it's part of their identity or family tradition. The husband's concern is about others assuming they married after her achievements, which he feels is unfair. However, the wife has her own reasons tied to her family and personal contributions.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and understanding. The husband feels his sacrifices aren't acknowledged, while the wife feels her individual effort should be recognized. Both have valid points. The husband's intention is to show unity, but the wife's choice is about her own identity. It's important to note that they are discussing this without conflict, which suggests a willingness to find a compromise.\n\nIs the husband wrong for expecting her to use their married name? It depends on the cultural context and personal values, but in many cases, people are supportive of each other's professional identities even if it doesn't align with their marital name. The husband's request might come from a place of wanting to feel part of her achievements, but the wife's right to choose her name is also significant.\n\nI think the husband isn't entirely wrong because he's expressing a desire for unity and recognition of their shared sacrifices. However, the wife's perspective is equally valid. The answer might lean toward B (Not in the wrong) because his intent is to celebrate their unity, but there's also a need for understanding her point. However, in many modern contexts, supporting each other's professional identity is seen as important. Maybe the answer is A if the husband is being overly controlling, but the situation doesn't indicate that. They are discussing it amicably. So perhaps B is the right choice.\n"
