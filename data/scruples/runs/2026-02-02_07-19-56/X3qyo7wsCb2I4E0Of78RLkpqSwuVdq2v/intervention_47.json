Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate is a betrayal of their unity. He mentions that they've been married during most of her schooling, shared significant sacrifices, and he's shouldering more financial and household responsibilities. He wants to show that their achievements are joint, not just hers. On the other hand, the wife argues that she's the one working full-time and attending school, paying for most of her tuition, and that she deserves recognition under her family's name since he wasn't present in her classes. They're both in a happy marriage, but this is a point of debate.\n\nNow, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, it's common for women to use their maiden name on academic certificates, especially if they've maintained their family name professionally. However, the husband's perspective is about unity and shared sacrifice. The key here is whether expecting her to use the married name is a reasonable request or if it's overstepping.\n\nThe wife's argument is about her personal achievement and identity. She's paying for her education and working, so she might see the certificate as her personal accomplishment. The husband might feel entitled to some recognition of their shared efforts. But does that give him the right to dictate how she presents her name? That's the crux.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's concern about others assuming they married after her education. However, if they've been married during her studies, maybe a certificate with her maiden name isn't a big issue. People might not make that assumption, especially if they know their timeline. Also, the wife's family name could be important to her for personal or cultural reasons.\n\nIs the husband being self-centered? He might be projecting his feelings onto her, expecting her to conform to his view of unity. The wife has her own reasons for wanting to use her maiden name, which are valid. The husband's request could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and individual achievements.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have contributed in different ways. However, the decision about how to present her name on a personal document should ideally be hers. The husband's argument about unity is valid, but it shouldn't override her personal choice without mutual understanding.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's insistence might be the wrong approach. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
