Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether the husband is right to expect his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is graduating dental school, and she wants to practice under their married last name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels this is a betrayal of their unity because they've been married through most of her schooling, and both have made sacrifices. He's concerned about people misassuming they got married after her work. The wife argues she worked full-time and paid for most of her tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family's name. They're not fighting but discussing it together.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared sacrifice vs. individual achievement. The husband values unity and joint effort, while the wife values her personal contributions and family heritage. \n\nI should think about cultural norms. In some cultures, using the maiden name on academic credentials is common to acknowledge family lineage. However, in others, the married name might be more expected. But the husband's argument is more about the perception of their unity and sacrifices. However, the wife's point is about her individual effort and the fact that she's paying for it. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions he's been the primary income earner and she's done more housework. But she's also working full-time while studying. So, there's a balance of contributions. The husband might feel he's shouldered more financially, but the wife is managing the dual responsibilities of work and study. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect her to use the married name? It could be seen as respecting her choice in her professional identity. Academic credentials often allow individuals to choose their name, so perhaps the wife has the right to decide. The husband's concern about people assuming they married later might be valid, but that's more about perception than actual fact. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's desire to honor her family's name could be a personal or familial tradition. It's important to consider both perspectives. The husband's feeling of betrayal might stem from feeling their joint effort isn't recognized, but the wife might see it as her individual achievement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of personal choice and mutual respect. If they have a happy marriage and are discussing it openly, the main issue is about respecting each other's viewpoints. The husband might not be in the wrong for feeling that way, but pushing for the married name without considering her reasons could be. The wife's right to her own professional identity is important. So maybe the husband is not in the wrong for his feelings, but the expectation might be where the issue lies. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is asking if he's in the wrong for expecting it, then perhaps the answer depends on whether his expectation is valid. Since the wife has her reasons and the choice is hers, the husband might not be in the wrong for his feelings but could be if he's insisting without her agreement. However, the question is about the wife's choice versus his expectation. Given that the wife has her reasons and the certificate is her personal achievement, the husband might be in the wrong for expecting her to use the married name. But this is a nuanced situation. In many cases, individuals do choose their maiden names for professional credentials. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her choice and the certificate is her own. But maybe it's a tie, but since the question is yes or no, perhaps the answer is A.\n"
