Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The situation is that they've been married most of her dental school time, and he feels it's a betrayal to their unity. She argues she should take pride in her family's name and she's the one paying for most of her tuition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal norms. In many places, people can choose to use their maiden name or married name on academic documents. It's often a personal choice, not a legal requirement. The husband's concern is about others thinking they got married after her achievements, implying that they worked on it together. But the wife's argument is about her own identity and the effort she's personally put in.\n\nThe key points here are about respect for individual identity versus shared partnership. The husband feels that using the married name would symbolize their joint effort, but the wife feels her name should represent her personal accomplishments. It's important to note that she's not denying their contributions but is choosing to use her maiden name for her own reasons. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife has the right to her own name and the recognition she feels is appropriate for her personal achievements. The husband's desire for unity is valid, but it shouldn't override her autonomy. The situation is more of a debate than a fight, and both have valid perspectives. However, the husband is making her feel like she must conform to his expectations, which could be the issue. The answer likely leans towards the author (husband) being in the wrong because the decision should be hers to make without pressure from him.\n"
