Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate. The situation involves differing opinions between the couple about name choices.\n\nFirst, the husband's perspective: He feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married during most of her schooling. He mentions sacrifices like financial support, taking on housework, and wanting to showcase their joint effort. He doesn't want people to think they got married after she achieved her degree.\n\nThe wife's side: She wants to use her maiden name on the certificate, even though she practices under the married name. She's working full-time and attending school, paying for most of her tuition. She feels she deserves the recognition for her own efforts since he wasn't in the classes with her.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect and the significance of names. In many cultures, people choose to keep their maiden names for various reasons, especially in professional contexts. It's a personal choice and can be a matter of identity. The husband's reasoning is based on the idea of shared sacrifice and unity, which is valid, but the wife's stance is about her individual achievement and identity.\n\nThe husband might be projecting his desire for joint recognition onto her, not considering that her choice is about her personal pride and heritage. He's conflating his sacrifices with the necessity for her to use their shared name. It's important to recognize that while collaboration is key in a relationship, individual choices regarding names should be respected unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise.\n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might be misunderstanding the situation. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If he is insisting on changing her choice without mutual agreement, that could be imposing his will. However, the scenario says they have a happy marriage and it's a discussion, not a forced decision. The wife's right to her name is a significant factor here. In many cases, using a maiden name is a personal decision, and the husband's concern about perception might not override that. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy in this choice, but the answer isn't straightforward. However, cultural norms might influence this, but generally, respecting individual choice is key.\n"
