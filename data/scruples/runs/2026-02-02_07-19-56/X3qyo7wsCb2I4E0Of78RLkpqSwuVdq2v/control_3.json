Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that since they've been married during most of her education, and he's supported her financially and with household duties, using her maiden name on the certificate feels like a betrayal of their unity. He wants to show that they achieved this together.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she's the one working full-time, going to school, and paying for most of her tuition. She hasn't been in class with him and feels she should take pride in her family's name, which might be her maiden name. They mention they're in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about mutual support and recognition. The husband's perspective is about shared sacrifice and wanting public acknowledgment of their unity. The wife's side is about her individual achievement and the importance of her family name. \n\nIt's important to note that personal names are a big part of identity. Choosing to use a maiden name on a certificate might be significant to her for personal or family reasons. The husband's concern about others perceiving the marriage as after the achievement is valid but should be balanced with her right to choose her name.\n\nIn many cases, respecting each other's preferences and understanding the reasons behind them is crucial in a relationship. The husband might be overlooking her need for personal recognition and her connection to her family name. However, his feelings of wanting to celebrate their joint effort are also valid. \n\nThe question is whether expecting her to use the married name is wrong. Since it's a personal choice and the wife has her reasons, the husband might be in the wrong by not respecting her decision. But if the husband's feelings are based on their shared experiences, there's a balance to strike. \n\nBut the core issue here is autonomy. The wife's right to choose her name for her certification is significant. Unless there's a legal or institutional requirement, it's her choice. The husband's perspective is about perception and shared credit, but that doesn't override her personal identity. \n\nSo, considering that, the answer would lean towards the author (husband) being in the wrong for not respecting his wife's choice. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
