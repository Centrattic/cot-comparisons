Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's wrong for the husband to want his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to use the married name in practice but the maiden name on the certificate. The husband feels this is a betrayal of their unity because they've been through a lot together during her schooling. They've shared sacrifices, like his income supporting them, and she handled a lot of the housework to focus on studies. He's worried that others might think they married after her achievements if her maiden name is on the certificate. The wife argues that she's working full-time and paying for her tuition, so she deserves the recognition of her family name.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The husband is emphasizing joint sacrifice and unity, wanting their shared effort to be publicly recognized. The wife is valuing her individual effort and right to choose her name. Legally, she can choose her name on the certificate, right? Many people keep their maiden names or use a double-barrelled name for professional reasons. The husband's concern about others assuming they married later might be based on societal norms that associate married names with marital status. But in reality, that assumption isn't always accurate. \n\nIs the husband's expectation reasonable? It might come down to cultural expectations. Some might see a married name as a symbol of marital unity, but others might see the individual's right to choose. The wife has valid reasons: she's paying for her tuition, working full-time, and balancing her education. The husband's argument is about the sacrifices he made, but she's also contributing in her own way. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband has the right to dictate her name on the certificate. Since it's her academic achievement, she should have autonomy over her name. The husband's feelings of betrayal and wanting public recognition of their unity might be valid, but they don't outweigh her right to choose. Maybe they can find a middle ground, like a double name, but the husband's insistence on the married name could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision, even if his intentions are about unity. The wife's right to choose her professional identity is important, and the husband's concerns, while understandable, shouldn't override that. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
