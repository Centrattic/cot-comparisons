Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is upset that his wife wants to use her maiden name on her doctoral certificate, even though they've been married during most of her schooling. He feels it's a betrayal to their unity and the joint sacrifices they made. The wife argues she worked full time and paid for most of her tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family name. They're in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate.\n\nI should consider cultural norms here. Traditionally, women change their names after marriage, but that's changing. Many now choose to keep their maiden names professionally. The husband's concern is about perception\u2014others might think he married her after she achieved her degree. But that's an assumption. The wife's perspective is about her personal and financial contributions to her education.\n\nThe key points are mutual agreement and respect. The husband wants to show unity, but the wife feels her name choice is personal. They need to find a compromise. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. \n\nHe's not forcing her to do anything, just expressing his feelings. The wife has her own reasons. There's no clear right or wrong in name choice. Cultural shifts lean towards respecting individuals' name choices. The husband's reasoning is based on perception and shared sacrifice, but the wife's autonomy is also valid. \n\nSo, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but he should respect her choice. The answer might be B (No), because the husband's feelings are valid, but he's not wrong for wanting to present unity. However, the wife's choice is her right. The situation is more about differing perspectives rather than one being wrong.\n"
