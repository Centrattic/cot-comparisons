Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author wants his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate, while she prefers her maiden name. The key points here are about unity vs. personal choice and contributions.\n\nFirst, the author feels that using the maiden name is a betrayal of their unity since they've worked together through her schooling. He mentions sacrifices they both made, like his income supporting them and taking on more household duties. He's concerned about perception\u2014people might think they got married after her achievements.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she works full-time and pays for most of her tuition. She wants to take pride in her family's name, implying her original family's contributions. She also points out that the author didn't attend classes with her, so she deserves the recognition under her own name.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, both have valid perspectives. The author values shared identity and joint effort, which is understandable in a marriage. However, the wife's right to use her chosen name, especially for an academic credential, is a personal choice. Many people choose to keep their maiden names for various reasons, including professional identity or family ties. The fact that they are discussing it together and it's not a fight suggests mutual respect.\n\nThe author's concern about others perceiving the timeline of their marriage is a bit about how others see their relationship, which shouldn't be the main factor. The wife's argument about her own contributions and financial responsibility is strong. Since the certificate is her academic achievement, the name choice is hers unless they agreed otherwise. The author might be projecting his values onto her, expecting her to align with his view of unity, which might not be fair. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, in some cultures, changing names is more customary, but in others, women retain their maiden names. The key here is mutual agreement. Since the wife has her reasons and the author is trying to impose his view, it's more about respecting her autonomy. However, the author's feelings are valid too. The balance here is tricky, but the woman's right to her name on her own credential is a significant point. So, the author might be in the wrong if he's insisting without considering her autonomy. Hence, answer A.\n"
