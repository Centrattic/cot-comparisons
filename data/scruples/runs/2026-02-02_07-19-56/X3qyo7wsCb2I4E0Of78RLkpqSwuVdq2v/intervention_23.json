Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The husband is upset that his wife wants her doctoral certificate to have her maiden name instead of her married name. He feels this is a betrayal of their unity since they've been married during most of her education, and he's made sacrifices to support her. The wife argues that she's the one working and paying for school, so she deserves recognition under her family name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, people, especially women, might choose to keep their maiden names professionally for various reasons, like career continuity or personal identity. The husband might not realize that this is a common choice and not a slight against their marriage. His reaction seems rooted in feeling that the name choice undermines their shared effort. But does he have a right to expect her to use their married name?\n\nThen there's the aspect of sacrifices each made. The husband mentions financial support and household responsibilities, while the wife is handling the academic work and payments. Both have made contributions, but the husband might be framing his role as more central to her success. However, the wife's argument is that she's the one directly earning the degree and paying for it, which is a valid point. She might see the name as her personal achievement.\n\nAlso, the husband's concern about people thinking they married after her education is a bit about perception. But does that perception matter? If people make assumptions, that's their problem, not hers. The wife's choice to use her maiden name doesn't negate their partnership. It's possible the husband is projecting his desire for public recognition of their unity onto her, without considering her personal preferences.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's request could be seen as pressuring her to conform to his expectations, which might not respect her autonomy. Professional achievements are personal, and the choice of name is a personal decision. Even though they're married, she has the right to present her name as she wishes professionally. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or a need for validation that his support was essential, but that doesn't make it right to demand her to use their married name.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's choice regarding her professional identity. While their partnership is important, her right to use her maiden name on her certificate is a personal decision that shouldn't be seen as a betrayal. The wife's rationale is valid, and the husband needs to accept her decision without feeling it diminishes their shared sacrifices.\n"
