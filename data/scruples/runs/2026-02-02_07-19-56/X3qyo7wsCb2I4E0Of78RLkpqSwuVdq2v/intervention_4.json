Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who wants his wife to put her married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to use her married name in practice but her maiden name on the certificate. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity and the joint sacrifices they made. The wife argues she paid for most of her tuition and worked full-time while attending school, so she deserves the recognition under her family name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is about unity and shared sacrifices, wanting to showcase their partnership. The wife's argument is about personal achievement and financial contribution. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus partnership. The husband might feel that using the married name on the certificate symbolizes their joint effort. However, the wife's name on her certificate should be her choice, especially since it's her academic credential. She might view her family name as part of her identity separate from the marriage. \n\nI remember that in many countries, individuals can choose to use their married name on official documents, but it's not mandatory. The fact that the wife is paying for most of her tuition and working full-time suggests she's making a significant personal investment. The husband's argument that they've shared sacrifices is valid, but it's important to respect her autonomy in this decision. \n\nAlso, the husband's concern about others assuming they got married after her education might be more about perception than reality. But the wife's right to choose how she presents her academic achievements is significant. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might see using the married name as a sign of unity, but others might see it as imposing on her personal identity. Since they're in a happy, long marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight, it's about mutual respect. \n\nThe husband might not be in the wrong entirely for feeling that way, but the expectation that she must use his name could be problematic. The wife's decision to use her own family name might be about honoring her own heritage or personal branding in her career. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's stance could be seen as not respecting his wife's personal choice and contributions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by expecting her to use the married name on her certificate.\n"
