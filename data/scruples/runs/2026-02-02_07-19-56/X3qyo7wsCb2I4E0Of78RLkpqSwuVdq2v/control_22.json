Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has been in school for a long time, working full-time and paying most of her tuition. The husband feels that since they've been married during most of her schooling and they both sacrificed a lot, using her maiden name on the certificate might make people think they got married after she achieved her degree. He wants to show unity in their joint effort.\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, argues that she worked hard, paid for her tuition, and that she deserves the recognition under her family name. They have a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight. \n\nNow, societal norms vary. Traditionally, some might expect a spouse to use the married name, but many people today choose to keep their maiden name for various reasons, including professional recognition or personal identity. The wife's argument is about her individual achievement and pride in her family's name. The husband's concern is about how it might be perceived by others, implying a lack of recognition of their shared sacrifices.\n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? It might depend on cultural expectations and the couple's values. If they've discussed this and respect each other's perspectives, maybe it's not about right or wrong but about compromise. However, the husband's expectation could be seen as imposing his views on her personal and professional identity. The wife's choice is about her own achievements and identity, which is a significant aspect. \n\nIn many cases, people choose to keep their maiden names for professional reasons, so the husband's insistence might be seen as not respecting her autonomy. At the same time, the husband's feelings about unity are valid. But is he in the wrong? It might come down to whether his insistence is overstepping, especially if she's making the choice for herself. \n\nThe answer could be A (the husband is in the wrong) because he's expecting her to change her name to accommodate his perception of unity, possibly not respecting her personal and professional identity. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if they're working through it together as a team. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and given that the wife is using her name for her own reasons, I might lean towards A.\n"
