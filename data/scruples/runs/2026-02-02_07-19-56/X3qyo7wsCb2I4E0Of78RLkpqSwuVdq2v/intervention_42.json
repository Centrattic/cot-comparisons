Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels this is a betrayal of their unity, given they've been married through most of her schooling, shared sacrifices, and he's the primary breadwinner. He's worried about people assuming they got married after her achievements if the certificate has her maiden name. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she works full-time and pays for most of her tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family name. They mention it's a debate, not a fight, so they might be looking for understanding rather than conflict.\n\nLegally, the certificate should have the name under which she enrolled. If she used her maiden name during enrollment, changing it later might not be possible. But maybe the university allows name changes if she's married. The husband's concern is about perception, but the wife has her reasons related to her own contributions and family name.\n\nThe husband's argument is about shared sacrifice and unity. However, the wife's perspective is about her individual effort and pride in her family's name. It's a matter of personal choice and mutual respect. The husband might not be in the wrong in wanting to present a united front, but he should respect her autonomy in her professional identity. \n\nIn many cases, people choose to use their maiden name in professional contexts for various reasons, including family legacy or personal identity. The husband's desire for unity is valid, but the wife's right to choose her name is also important. It's a balance between partnership and individuality. The key here is communication and finding a compromise. If they agree to use the married name in practice but the certificate remains as is, maybe they can honor both perspectives. \n\nSince the husband's reasoning is based on the collective effort, but the wife's is about her personal contributions and family, the husband might be overstepping by not respecting her decision. So the answer could be that he's in the wrong. However, if the certificate must have the name she enrolled with, maybe it's not his call. But if he's pressuring her beyond that, then he's in the wrong. The situation seems more about differing values rather than one side being clearly wrong. But considering the wife's autonomy and the husband's lack of direct contribution to the academic work, the answer leans towards the husband being in the wrong.\n"
