Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married during most of her schooling, both made sacrifices, and he's the primary earner. He wants to show that they did it together. The wife argues she works full-time and pays for most of her tuition and deserves the recognition under her family's name.\n\nHmm. So, the husband's reasoning is based on shared sacrifice and unity. The wife's side is about personal pride and her family's name. The husband is using the married name as a symbol of their joint effort, while she's connecting her family name to her academic achievements. \n\nI should think about cultural norms. In many societies, people have the right to choose their name on official documents, including academic ones. The wife might have the legal right to choose. The husband's request might be seen as imposing his perspective on her identity. \n\nAlso, the husband's argument about others assuming they married after her work is a bit flimsy. The certificate's name doesn't necessarily reflect the timeline of the marriage. Plus, if she's practicing under the married name, maybe the certificate's name isn't as visible anyway. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is feeling unacknowledged. They did support each other, and he might feel his contributions aren't recognized if she uses her maiden name on the certificate. But the wife is also making a significant personal contribution. \n\nI need to consider if the husband's stance is about respecting her autonomy versus their shared identity. If the wife is legally allowed to choose her name, then the husband's expectation might be overstepping. However, if they had an agreement before marriage or during the marriage about shared names for academic achievements, that could be different. But from the context, there's no mention of such an agreement. \n\nThe wife's argument that she pays for most of her tuition and works full-time while in school is a strong point. She's taking on a significant personal responsibility, so her desire to have the certificate in her chosen name (whether maiden or married) might be about her personal identity and achievements. \n\nThe husband's concern about unity might be valid, but it's important for both partners to respect each other's individuality. Forcing her to use the married name on the certificate could be seen as not respecting her personal choice and contributions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong here because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and her right to choose how she presents her academic achievements. The wife's name on the certificate is her personal achievement, even if they supported each other. The husband's desire for unity is understandable but shouldn't override her personal choice.\n"
