Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong in this situation. The main issue is about the wife wanting to use her maiden name on her doctoral certificate while practicing under their married name. The husband feels this is a betrayal of their unity, given they've been married during her studies and he's supported her financially and with childcare. The wife argues she paid for most of her tuition and deserves the recognition under her family's name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, it's traditional for women to take their spouse's surname, but this is changing. Some women choose to keep their maiden name professionally. The husband might feel that using her maiden name on the certificate implies she's not fully part of their shared life, especially since they've been married during her education. But the wife's perspective is that her academic achievement is her own, and she earned it while working and studying full-time.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is about unity and shared sacrifice. He's contributed financially and helped with domestic responsibilities. However, the wife's argument is about her personal achievement and the recognition of her family's name. The question is whether expecting her to use the married name on her certificate is reasonable.\n\nI should consider autonomy and respect. The wife has the right to choose how she presents her name professionally. Academic institutions often allow individuals to choose their name on certificates. The husband's concern about others assuming they married after her education is understandable, but that's more about perception. The wife's decision doesn't negate their shared sacrifices; it's about her personal identity and pride in her family's name.\n\nThe husband might not be in the wrong if he's expressing his feelings and concerns respectfully. However, the expectation that she must use the married name could be seen as invalidating her choice. The key is mutual respect. The wife has the right to her own name on her certificate, even if they use a shared name in practice. The husband's feelings are valid, but the expectation might be imposing his view on her professional identity.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the husband is expecting her to conform to his view of unity, possibly disregarding her right to her own name and recognition. The wife's choice is about her personal and academic identity, which should be respected.\n"
