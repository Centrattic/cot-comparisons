Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe husband is upset that his wife wants to put her maiden name on her doctoral certificate instead of their married name. They're married, and she's finishing dental school. He feels it's a betrayal because they've been married through most of her education, shared many sacrifices, and he's been the main financial support. He wants her to use the married name on the certificate to show their unity. She argues that she works full-time and in school, pays for her own tuition, and that she deserves the recognition of her family name. They're not fighting, just discussing.\n\nHmm. The husband is pushing for the married name as a symbol of their shared effort. But the wife has her own reasons. Using a maiden name on academic credentials is a personal choice many make, even when married. So is the husband wrong for expecting her to use the married name?\n\nWell, the wife's argument is about her individual achievement and her family's name. Academic credentials often reflect personal identity, and changing names can be a personal choice. The husband might feel left out, but does that mean he's wrong? Maybe not. But is it fair to expect her to change her name on the certificate? That's where the conflict is.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, people often keep their maiden names for professional reasons. The husband's insistence might come from traditional views about married names, but he's not forcing her to change her legal name just for the certificate. However, he's upset because he feels they should share the recognition. But the certificate is about her academic achievement, which she earned through her own efforts. Even if they shared sacrifices, the achievement is hers.\n\nSo the husband might be in the wrong here because he's not respecting her right to present her name as she chooses. The wife has the right to her maiden name on her certificate, and his expectation that she use the married name could be seen as imposing his wishes on her personal and professional identity. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
