Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife wants to use her maiden name on the certificate even though she practices under the married name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married for most of her schooling and both made sacrifices. He's concerned about others thinking they got married after her work. The wife argues that she worked full time and paid for most of her tuition, so she deserves to take pride in her family name. They are in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, using a maiden name on a certificate is a personal choice. Many people choose to keep their maiden names for professional or personal reasons. The husband's concern is about unity and perception. But the wife's choice might be about her identity and accomplishments. The husband's argument is based on shared sacrifices, which is valid, but does that give him a right to dictate her name on the certificate? \n\nAlso, the wife is paying for her own tuition and working full time. That's a significant contribution. The husband's support is acknowledged, but maybe he's conflating the certificate name with the shared effort. The certificate is her academic achievement, so her choice to use her maiden name could be about personal pride and heritage. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's feelings about unity are understandable. They have been through a lot together. But maybe he's expecting her to symbolically represent their unity in a public document. However, it's her name to use as she sees fit. The key here is autonomy versus shared identity. \n\nIn many societies, people choose their names for various reasons, and respecting that choice is important. The husband might need to accept that her decision isn't a betrayal but a personal one. The wife might need to acknowledge his feelings about their partnership. But ultimately, the decision rests with her. \n\nThe question is if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If he's pressuring her to use his name, which is her right not to, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he's just expressing his feelings and their situation is a respectful discussion, maybe not. But the core issue is whether he's wrong in expecting her to use his name. Since she has the right to choose, expecting her to do otherwise could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. So the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's reasoning is about unity and shared sacrifice. If the wife is using the married name professionally, maybe the certificate's name isn't as important. But it's her academic identity. The husband's concern is about perception, which is a valid concern, but the wife's right to her name is also valid. \n\nTherefore, the husband might not be in the wrong if he's expressing his feelings and they're discussing it, but the expectation that she must comply could be the issue. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting that. Since she has the right to her name, expecting her to change it could be wrong. Hence, Answer A.\n"
