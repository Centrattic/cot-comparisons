Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is a husband who's upset because his wife wants to use her maiden name on her doctoral certificate instead of their married name. They've been married for most of her schooling, and the husband feels like this is a betrayal of their unity. He mentions that they've both sacrificed a lot, with him supporting them financially and handling most of the housework so she could focus on school. He's concerned that if others see her certificate with her maiden name, they might think they got married after she earned the degree, which he sees as not recognizing their joint efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she works full-time and goes to school full-time, paid for most of her tuition, and since he wasn't in class with her, she deserves the recognition under her family's name. They are in a happy marriage, and this is more a debate than a fight.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations around married names and academic credentials. Traditionally, people might use their married names on professional credentials, but that's not universal. The wife has the right to choose her name, and academic institutions usually allow that. The husband's concern about perception is valid, but maybe he's projecting his feelings onto others' assumptions.\n\nThe husband's argument is based on shared sacrifice and unity. While they did support each other, the wife's education is her personal achievement. She might feel that her name choice reflects her personal identity and the contributions of her family of origin. The husband's feeling of betrayal could stem from a desire for recognition of their partnership, but he's attributing her choice to a lack of recognition of their joint efforts, which might not be fair.\n\nThe wife paid for her tuition and managed both work and school. That's a significant individual effort. The husband's financial support was important, but the degree is hers. She might want to honor her original family name as part of her professional identity. The husband's insistence could be seen as dismissing her autonomy or her family's role in her success.\n\nHowever, the husband's perspective isn't entirely baseless. He's made sacrifices too, but that doesn't mean he gets to dictate how she presents her achievements. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. The wife's choice is personal, and the husband's feelings are valid but shouldn't override her decision. The author (husband) is in the wrong if he's making the choice about her name without considering her perspective. Name choice is deeply personal, and her decision to use her maiden name doesn't negate their shared sacrifices. The husband's framing it as a betrayal of unity is perhaps projecting his insecurities onto her decision. The answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
