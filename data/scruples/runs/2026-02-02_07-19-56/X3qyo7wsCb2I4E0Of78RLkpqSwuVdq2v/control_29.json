Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a married couple where the wife is about to graduate dental school. The husband is upset that she wants to use her maiden name on her doctoral certificate instead of their married name. He feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've both sacrificed a lot during her schooling. She argues that she works full-time, pays for most of her tuition, and that she deserves the recognition with her family's name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and personal choices. In many societies, people have the choice to keep their maiden name, hyphenate, or take the spouse's name. It's a personal decision and should be respected. The husband is arguing from a place of wanting unity, but the wife's choice about her name is hers alone. He's trying to equate using her maiden name on the certificate as not recognizing their joint efforts, which might not be fair.\n\nHe mentions that they've been married during most of her schooling and they both made sacrifices. However, the certificate is a personal academic achievement. The fact that she's paying for most of her tuition and working full-time while studying might contribute to her desire to use her family name. She might see this as her own accomplishment, separate from their marriage. The husband is projecting his feelings of shared effort onto her, which might not align with her perspective.\n\nAlso, the husband's concern about others assuming they got married after her education is a bit of a social assumption. But that's not her problem to solve; it's her certificate, and people should understand that name choices don't necessarily reflect marital timelines. The key here is respect for her autonomy versus the husband's desire for unity. Since the wife has a valid reason and the name choice is her right, the husband might be overstepping by expecting her to use the married name. Therefore, the author (husband) is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice and personal pride in her family's name.\n"
