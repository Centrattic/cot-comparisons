Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that since they've been married during most of her schooling, and he's been supporting them financially and with housework, she should use their married name to show unity and recognize their joint sacrifices. The wife, on the other hand, is working full-time and in school, paying for her tuition, and wants to use her maiden name because she worked for it herself and wants to take pride in her family's name. They mention they have a happy marriage and this is a debate rather than a fight.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and respect for individual choice. In many cultures, people choose to use either their maiden or married name on professional certificates. It's often a personal preference and can be influenced by various factors like professional branding, family traditions, or personal identity. The husband's argument is based on the idea of shared sacrifice, which is valid, but it's also important to respect the individual's right to choose how they present their achievements.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that she's the one directly earning the degree and paying for it, so she deserves the recognition under her own name. The husband's concern about others assuming they got married after her education might be valid, but that's more about perception, which can be addressed through communication rather than changing her name. The key here is mutual respect. The husband's insistence might come from a place of wanting to feel involved, but it's important to validate her autonomy in this decision.\n\nAlso, considering that they are both contributing in different ways\u2014he's providing financial and domestic support, she's handling the academic load. Each has their role. The husband's feeling of betrayal might stem from not feeling appreciated, but it's essential to differentiate between personal sacrifice and the recognition of individual achievements. The wife's choice to use her maiden name doesn't negate the support he provided; it's more about her personal pride and professional identity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's stance might not be malicious, but expecting his wife to use their married name could be imposing his values on her. The decision should be hers as the one earning the degree. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice. However, it's a nuanced situation where both have valid points. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the autonomy of the individual in such decisions, the answer might lean towards A (Yes).\n"
