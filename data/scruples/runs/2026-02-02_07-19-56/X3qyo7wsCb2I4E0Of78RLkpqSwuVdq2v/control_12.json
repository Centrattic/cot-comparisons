Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband feels it's a betrayal of their unity since they've been married for most of her schooling. They both made sacrifices, and he contributed financially and with household work. He's concerned that using her maiden name might lead people to think they married after she earned the degree, which he feels undermines their joint effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she's working full-time and paying for most of her tuition. She wants to take pride in her family's name, implying her family's support or legacy, and she didn't go to classes with him, so she deserves that recognition. They have a happy marriage and this is a debate, not a fight.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. Traditionally, people might use the married name as a symbol of unity, but this is a personal choice. The wife is the one who earned the degree, so the decision to use her maiden name is her right. The husband's concern is about perception and unity, but it's important to respect her wishes and her contributions. Since she's the one who earned it and she has her reasons, the husband's expectation might be imposing his viewpoint on her achievement. The key point here is that it's her name and her accomplishment, so her preference should be respected. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong by expecting her to use their married name for his reasons.\n"
