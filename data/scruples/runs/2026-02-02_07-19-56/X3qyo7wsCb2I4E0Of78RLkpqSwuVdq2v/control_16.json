Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married during most of her schooling, both made sacrifices, and he's concerned about others assuming they married after her achievements. The wife argues that she's the one working full-time and paying for most of her tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family name.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared sacrifice versus individual achievement. The husband wants to symbolize their joint effort by having the married name on the certificate. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as her personal accomplishment since she's the one going through the education and paying for it. \n\nCulturally, using a married name is a personal choice. In many cases, people choose to maintain their maiden name professionally for various reasons, such as established professional identity or personal preference. The husband's argument is about unity and shared sacrifice, but the wife's perspective is about individual merit and the fact that she's the one directly responsible for the academic work and financial investment in her tuition.\n\nIt's also important to note that the husband is not wrong in feeling that their relationship has been a partnership. However, the decision to use a maiden name on a certificate is a personal choice that might not necessarily reflect a lack of recognition of their partnership. The wife might be balancing her professional identity with personal identity, which is a common scenario.\n\nThe question of right or wrong here hinges on mutual respect for each other's viewpoints. The husband's desire for unity is valid, but the wife's right to choose her name for professional recognition is also valid. Since the situation is described as a debate rather than a fight, it suggests both are open to discussion. However, if the husband is insisting that she must use the married name solely to symbolize their unity without considering her perspective, that could be where he's in the wrong. But if he's expressing his feelings and they're discussing it as a partnership, it's more about negotiation than right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might argue that the husband is entitled to his feelings, but the wife's autonomy in name choice is a significant factor. There's no universal right or wrong here, but given the context, the husband might be overstepping if he's not allowing his wife the space to make this decision based on her own preferences and professional considerations. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) if he's not respecting her autonomy, but if it's a mutual discussion, it's more a matter of differing priorities. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that the wife is making her own choices based on her circumstances, the husband's expectation might be the issue.\n"
