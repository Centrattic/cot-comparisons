Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the husband feels his wife should use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate might make others think they got married after she completed her education, not acknowledging their joint sacrifices. The wife argues that she works full-time and goes to school, paid for her tuition, and deserves recognition under her family's name. They mention they're in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, the key points are about shared sacrifices and recognition versus personal achievement and family name. The husband is emphasizing unity and shared effort, while the wife is focusing on her individual contribution and family heritage. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some cultures, using the married name is more common, but in others, keeping the maiden name is also accepted. Academic credentials often include the name under which the degree was earned, which might be her maiden name if that's what she used during her studies. \n\nThe husband's concern about people assuming they married after her education is valid, but maybe that's a personal insecurity. The wife's argument about her financial contribution and personal effort is also valid. She might want to honor her family background.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He's not being disrespectful, just expressing a preference for unity. But does he have the right to expect her to change her name on an academic certificate? Academic credentials are personal achievements, and typically, the name is the one the individual uses. If she used her maiden name during the program, the certificate would have that name. Changing it might require administrative steps, which could be complicated. \n\nThe husband's argument hinges on them being equal partners in the sacrifices. However, the wife is making her own contributions and decisions about her professional identity. Her choice to practice under the married name shows she does acknowledge their unity, but the certificate is a personal achievement. \n\nSo, the husband is not in the wrong for feeling that way, but perhaps the expectation is misplaced. The wife has the right to her academic name. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's feelings are valid, but the wife's right to her name on the certificate is also valid. There's no clear right or wrong here, more of a difference in perspective.\n"
