Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the husband is asking if he's at fault for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate is a betrayal of their unity. They've been married for most of her schooling, both made sacrifices, and he contributed financially and with household work. He wants the certificate to reflect their joint effort. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she works full-time, pays for most of her tuition, and since he didn't attend classes with her, she deserves to take pride in her family's name. They're in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's emphasizing unity and shared sacrifice. But the wife's perspective is about her own contributions and her right to choose her name. In many cultures, especially in academia, people often retain their maiden names professionally for various reasons, including personal pride or professional continuity. \n\nThe husband's concern about others assuming they married after her success might stem from a desire for public recognition of their partnership. However, the wife's right to her own name, especially academically, is a personal choice. The fact that they are discussing this together and it's not a fight suggests mutual respect. \n\nThe husband might be overestimating how much the certificate's name affects their unity. The wife's use of her maiden name doesn't negate the sacrifices he made. It's her achievement, and she might have valid reasons for keeping her name. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the decision should be hers to make, as it's her degree. The husband's feelings are valid, but he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her to change her name for his sake. The key here is respecting her autonomy versus his desire for unity. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting her choice and the cultural norm of using one's own name on academic credentials. The wife's reasons are personal and valid, and the husband's feelings, while understandable, shouldn't override her decision.\n"
