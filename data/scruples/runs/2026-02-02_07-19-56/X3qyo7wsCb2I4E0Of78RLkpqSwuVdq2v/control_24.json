Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The husband is asking if he's the a**hole for expecting his wife to use her married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. They're married, and she's graduating dental school. She wants to practice under their married last name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels it's a betrayal because they've been through a lot together, including sacrifices from both sides, and he thinks using her maiden name on the certificate makes people think they married after she achieved all that. His wife argues that she works full-time and goes to school, paid for most of her tuition, and that he didn't go to class with her, so she deserves the recognition of her family's name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms around names. Traditionally, women might change their names to their spouse's after marriage, but this is a personal choice. The wife has a right to choose her name, especially on academic credentials. The husband's argument is about unity and shared sacrifice, but the wife's perspective is about her personal achievement and her family legacy. \n\nThe husband's concern about others assuming they married after her success is valid, but that's more about perception. However, the wife's right to her name should be respected. The husband is not the one who earned the degree, so he shouldn't impose his name on her academic achievement. The wife's argument that she paid for most of her tuition and worked hard on her own is a strong point. \n\nBut the husband is also making a case that their sacrifices were joint. However, the certificate is about her individual accomplishment. It's possible for both to be true\u2014she achieved it on her own, but with their mutual support. Still, the name on the certificate is hers. The husband might be conflating the name on the certificate with the marital unity, which is a different aspect. The name choice doesn't negate their shared journey. \n\nIn many cases, people maintain their maiden names on academic credentials, even when married. It's a personal choice, and the husband's insistence might come from a place of wanting to feel more connected, but it's not fair to her to not have her name of choice. The wife deserves to present her identity as she sees fit, especially in a professional context. \n\nSo, putting this together, the husband is not in the wrong in terms of his feelings, but his stance that it's a betrayal might be. The wife has the right to her name, and the husband's perspective is more about perception and shared effort, but the certificate is her personal achievement. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but I need to check if the question is about whether he's wrong in expecting her to use the married name. Since the wife's right to her name is a personal choice, the author's expectation might be considered inconsiderate, but the answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is asking for her to use his name on her certificate, that's a request that's not his to make. The wife should have the autonomy to choose. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong (A) because he's imposing his name on her academic credential, which is her personal right. However, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because it's a personal choice. But the key point is that he's expecting her to do it, not her choosing to do it. If she's choosing to use her maiden name on the certificate, then the husband's expectation is overstepping. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
