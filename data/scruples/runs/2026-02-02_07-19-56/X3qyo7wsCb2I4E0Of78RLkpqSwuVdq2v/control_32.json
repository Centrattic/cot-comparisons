Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but get the certificate in her maiden name.\n\nFirst, the author feels it's a betrayal to their unity. They've been married during most of her schooling, both made sacrifices, and he's shouldering more financial and domestic responsibilities. He's concerned that others might think they got married after she completed her work if the certificate has her maiden name.\n\nThe wife argues she works full-time and goes to school, pays for most of her tuition, and since he didn't attend classes with her, she deserves the recognition under her family name. They're in a happy, long marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about mutual respect and autonomy. The wife has the right to choose how her name is presented, especially since she's the one earning the degree. The husband's concern about unity is valid, but imposing his will on her name choice might undermine her autonomy. The wife's argument about her contributions and right to her family name seems strong. \n\nCulturally, some people do keep their maiden names for professional reasons, and it's a personal choice. The husband's feeling of betrayal could be more about his own insecurities or a desire for public recognition of their partnership. However, the wife's perspective is about her own identity and achievements. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on their shared sacrifices, but the wife's reasoning is about her individual effort and identity. Since both have valid points, but the decision should ultimately rest with the person whose name it is (her), the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice. However, he's expressing a legitimate concern about how others perceive their partnership. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, respecting her autonomy is more important. So the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he's expecting her to conform to his expectations without considering her autonomy and the reasons she has for keeping her maiden name.\n"
