Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is graduating dental school, and she wants to practice under the married name but use her maiden name on the certificate. The husband feels this is a betrayal to their unity, as they've been married for most of her schooling, shared sacrifices, and he's been the main financial provider. The wife, on the other hand, argues that she's the one working and studying full-time, paid for most tuition, and since he wasn't in classes with her, she deserves the recognition under her family's name.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared sacrifice, identity, and recognition. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate undermines their joint effort and could lead to others thinking they married after her achievements. The wife believes it's her name to use, especially since she's the one who earned the degree, and she's contributing financially now.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, in many societies, people choose to use their maiden name in professional contexts for various reasons\u2014continuity of identity, recognition of family heritage, or simply preference. However, in some cases, especially in marriages where there's a strong emphasis on shared identity, the partner might feel differently.\n\nThe husband's concern is about public perception and the symbolism of unity. He sees the certificate as a joint achievement. The wife's argument is about personal achievement and the practical aspect of her name being associated with her work. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a matter of perspective. The husband's feelings about unity are valid, but so is the wife's right to choose her professional identity. The fact that they're discussing it together and it's more of a debate than a fight suggests they both care about each other's perspectives.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The wife did most of the work in school, so her name choice might be about her personal journey. However, the husband's sacrifice in supporting her financially and domestically is significant. But is it fair to impose one's name choice on a partner for a certificate they didn't earn? Certificates typically bear the name under which the person was enrolled, which might be her maiden name if she didn't change it during school. Unless the institution allows name changes, she might not have the option anyway. \n\nWait, the original question mentions the certificate, which might be a legal document. If the certificate is issued under her enrollment name (maiden), then she might not have control over it. But the wife wants the certificate in her maiden name, which might be the case if she didn't update her name with the institution. If she can change it, then it's a choice. The husband is expecting her to do so for unity. \n\nBut the core issue is about recognition. The husband feels her choice doesn't acknowledge their partnership. The wife feels her achievements are her own. \n\nIs the husband wrong? It's a gray area. He has a right to feel that his sacrifices are important, but he's also making a claim on her professional identity. Typically, people choose their own names for academic credentials, and it's her right to decide. The husband's expectation might be culturally influenced but doesn't necessarily make him wrong in an absolute sense, but from a personal rights perspective, the wife's choice is valid. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's imposing his desire for unity on her professional identity, which is her personal choice. However, some might argue that it's a shared sacrifice, so using the married name would symbolize that. But given that she's the one who earned the degree and the certificate is her personal achievement, the choice should be hers. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for expecting her to do that. So answer A.\n"
