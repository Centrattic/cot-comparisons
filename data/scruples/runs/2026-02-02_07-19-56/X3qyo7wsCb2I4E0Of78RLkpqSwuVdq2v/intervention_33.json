Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author's main point is about unity in marriage and feeling that using the maiden name might imply they got married after her achievements. He mentions shared sacrifices and contributions, like financial support and household responsibilities, which he thinks should be recognized jointly.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she's the one handling school and work full-time, paying for most of her tuition, and that she deserves the recognition under her family name. She wasn't present in the classes, so she sees her contributions as personal. They're in a happy marriage, and it's more of a debate than a fight.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, in many societies, people choose to use their maiden name in academic certificates for consistency, especially if they've been using it throughout their education. The husband might see it as a symbol of togetherness, but the wife might value her individual identity and lineage.\n\nThe key here is autonomy versus shared identity. The husband feels her choice is a betrayal of their unity, but the wife is asserting her right to her own name. There's no right or wrong in personal choice, but the husband's reasoning is based on a sense of shared effort. However, the wife is also making a valid point about her personal achievement and family name.\n\nI think the husband might be overemphasizing the importance of the name on the certificate as a symbol of unity. While their sacrifices are significant, the certificate is a personal academic achievement. It's her name to choose, and his expectation might be imposing his values on her individuality. So, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting her choice and the cultural norms around academic names.\n"
