Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe husband is upset that his wife wants her doctoral certificate in her maiden name, even though they've been married through most of her schooling. He feels it's a betrayal of their unity because they both sacrificed a lot. The wife, on the other hand, argues that since she's working full-time and paying most of her tuition, she deserves to have her family name (maiden name) recognized. They're in a happy marriage and it's more of a debate than a fight.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the husband's feelings of unity and the wife's sense of personal achievement. The husband might be projecting his own values onto her, expecting her to use the married name as a symbol of their shared journey. But the wife is emphasizing her individual effort and the fact that she's paying for her education. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In some cultures, taking the husband's last name is common, but in others, people keep their maiden names for professional identity. The wife might value her own name for her career, especially in a field like dentistry where professional titles matter. \n\nThe husband's argument is about perception\u2014others might think they married after she earned the degree. But that's an assumption. The wife's point is about her personal contribution and the fact that she's financing it. The husband's sacrifice is real, but so is hers in terms of time and effort. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for expecting her to use his name? It could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. The wife has the right to choose her professional name, especially if she's paying for it. The husband's feelings about unity are valid, but they shouldn't override her personal choice. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because he's placing his expectations on her without fully considering her perspective and autonomy. The wife's decision is about her identity and achievements, which should be respected regardless of the husband's sacrifices. The core issue is about mutual respect and understanding each other's priorities.\n"
