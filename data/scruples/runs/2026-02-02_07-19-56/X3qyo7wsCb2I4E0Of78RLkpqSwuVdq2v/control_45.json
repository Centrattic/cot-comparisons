Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal norms. In many societies, it's common for women to keep their maiden names on academic achievements, even after marriage. That's a personal choice and often about maintaining a professional identity. On the other hand, using the married name might be seen as a symbol of marital unity.\n\nThe husband's argument is about unity and not wanting others to think they married after she earned her degree. He also mentions their joint sacrifices, like financial support and sharing housework. However, the wife's perspective is that she should take pride in her own family's name and that she's the one primarily funding and working on her degree. She didn't change her name when they got married, so maybe she values her maiden name for professional reasons.\n\nIt's important to note that the husband's reasoning is more about public perception and shared effort, while the wife's is about personal and family identity. There's no legal requirement for a doctoral certificate to have a married name, so the feasibility isn't the issue here. The key is mutual respect for each other's priorities. The husband might be overemphasizing the symbolic aspect of the name on the certificate as a representation of their unity, but the wife's right to choose her name for her academic work is significant. Since they are in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight, it's likely a matter of differing values rather than one party being wrong. The husband's expectations might not consider her individuality and the importance she places on her family name, which could be a point where he's mistaken. But it's also possible he's just trying to honor their partnership. I think the answer leans towards A, that he is in the wrong, because it's her academic achievement and she has the right to use her preferred name, even if it's her maiden. The sacrifices they both made don't necessitate a name change on her certificate for it to be a shared accomplishment.\n"
