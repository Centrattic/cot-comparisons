Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting the wife to use her married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife wants to use the married name for her practice but keep the certificate in her maiden name. The author feels it's a betrayal to their unity, considering their sacrifices during her schooling. He's upset because he's been the primary financial support, she's been working and studying, and he wants to show their joint effort. The wife argues she paid for most of her tuition and that he wasn't in class with her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the name on the certificate. The husband's reasoning is about unity and recognition of their shared sacrifices. The wife's side is about her personal achievement and the name she used during the program. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, changing names, especially for academic credentials, is a personal choice. Many people keep their maiden names on degrees, especially if they didn't have it during the time of study. The husband might feel overlooked, but the wife's argument is valid in that the degree is her personal accomplishment. \n\nThe husband is taking pride in their shared journey, which is understandable, but the certificate is a personal achievement. It's her name on the degree, so she has the right to choose. The financial support and sacrifices don't necessarily mean the name choice should reflect joint ownership. \n\nThe wife's point about paying for tuition is important. If she covered the costs herself, it's her to name it. The husband's role in supporting her doesn't negate her individual achievement. \n\nAlso, the certificate is a document that reflects the time she earned it. If she got the degree under her maiden name, changing it now might not align with the original records. Academic institutions often require proof of name changes for certificates, so it's possible but not straightforward. \n\nEmotionally, the husband's feelings of wanting recognition for their partnership are valid, but the wife's stance is about personal identity and pride. The fact that they're discussing it together shows they care about each other's perspectives. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband is imposing his expectations on her personal choice. The wife has the right to her own name and how she wants to be recognized professionally. His insistence might be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy, even if his intentions are good. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her personal decision regarding her academic credentials. The answer would be A (Yes). But wait, maybe there's a middle ground? Like if they could both agree on using the married name on the certificate. However, the wife's argument is that she wants the certificate in her maiden name. If it's not necessary for the certificate to reflect the married name, then the husband's insistence is unnecessary. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy in naming her degree, which is her personal achievement.\n"
