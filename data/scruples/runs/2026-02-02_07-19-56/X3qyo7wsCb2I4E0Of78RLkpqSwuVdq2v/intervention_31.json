Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing whether the wife should use her maiden name or married name on her doctoral certificate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate might imply they got married after her achievements, which he sees as a betrayal of their shared sacrifices. The wife argues that she should take pride in her family name and that she deserves recognition for her own efforts, especially since she's paying for most of her tuition and managing work and school. \n\nThe key points here are about personal identity, shared sacrifice, and mutual respect. The husband is prioritizing the unity of their marriage and not wanting to misrepresent the timeline of their achievements. The wife values her individual accomplishments and her original family name.\n\nNow, I should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, changing one's name to the spouse's is a common practice, but it's not universal. Some people choose to keep their maiden names for professional or personal reasons. The husband might see the name change as a symbol of their unity, while the wife might see her name as a part of her identity that shouldn't be altered for the sake of her partner's perception.\n\nThe husband's argument is about perception and the importance of their joint effort. However, the wife has her own reasons and is making significant personal sacrifices. It's important to respect individual autonomy. The husband is not wrong in feeling that the name might cause a misperception, but is that a valid reason to expect her to change her name? The wife's right to her own identity and achievements might outweigh that concern.\n\nAdditionally, the husband mentions that they have a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight. That suggests they are both trying to communicate and find a solution. The husband's concern is valid, but the wife's autonomy is also important. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, expecting someone to change their name for the sake of another person's perception could be seen as pressuring her to conform, which might not be right. Each person has the right to choose how they present their achievements. The wife's accomplishments are her own, and using her maiden name doesn't negate the shared sacrifices. The husband's viewpoint is understandable, but the decision should ultimately be the wife's. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his perception over his wife's autonomy and personal choice."
