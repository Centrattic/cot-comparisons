Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. They got married during her time in school, except for her first undergrad year. He feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they both sacrificed a lot, and he's been the main financial support. She wants to keep her maiden name, perhaps due to her family's name and her own contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many places, people change their names when they get married, but it's not universal. Some women keep their maiden names for various reasons, like professional identity, family legacy, or personal choice. The key issue here is the perception of betrayal. Does using her maiden name on a certificate count as a betrayal? Maybe not, since name choice is a personal decision. \n\nThe husband's argument is about unity and the joint effort. However, using a maiden name doesn't negate the joint sacrifices. It's more about how she wants to present her achievement. He's concerned about others assuming they got married after her graduation. But that's an assumption; the certificate could have a note or they could explain it. Her argument is about her own pride and the fact that she's the one handling most of the academic and financial aspects. If she paid for her own tuition, it's her academic achievement and thus her name on the certificate is about her personal contribution to earning the degree.\n\nAlso, they mentioned they're in a happy, long marriage and this is a debate, not a fight. So maybe both sides have valid points, but the husband's expectation might not consider her personal reasons enough. The right to choose one's professional name is often seen as an individual's right, regardless of marital status. The wife's desire to take pride in her family name (maiden or married) is her choice. The husband's sacrifice is real, but it doesn't necessarily entitle him to her using his name. They can still celebrate her achievement together without the name change. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her choice and the reasons behind it. Answer A.\n"
