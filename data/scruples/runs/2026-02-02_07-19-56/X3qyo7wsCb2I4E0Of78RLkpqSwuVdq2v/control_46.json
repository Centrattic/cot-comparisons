Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband and wife disagreeing on whether the wife should use her maiden name or married name on her doctoral certificate.\n\nFirst, the husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married through most of her schooling. He mentions they both sacrificed a lot\u2014like living primarily on his income, he did more housework so she could focus on school, and they worked together. He wants the certificate to have her married name to show they did it together, and he's worried people might think they got married after her achievements if her name is maiden on the cert.\n\nThe wife's side is that she's working full-time and going to school full-time, paid for most of her tuition, and since he didn't attend classes with her, she deserves the recognition under her family name. The user asks if the author (husband) is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, using a maiden name on professional certificates is a common choice for many people, especially if it's their preferred name. It's about personal identity and pride in their lineage or family. The husband's argument is about unity and joint effort, but the wife's decision is about her own contributions and family heritage.\n\nThe husband might be projecting his feelings about their partnership onto the name issue. He's emphasizing their shared sacrifices, but the wife is emphasizing her individual contributions. The key here is whether the husband's expectation is reasonable. Is it fair for him to expect her to use a married name on a personal achievement, especially if she has valid reasons for preferring her maiden name?\n\nAlso, the husband's concern about others assuming they married after her work could be valid, but that's more about perception. But the wife's right to choose how she presents her name on her certificate is important. Professional achievements are personal, and people often choose the name they feel most connected to. If the husband is pressuring her to change it for the sake of their unity, maybe that's imposing on her personal choice.\n\nHowever, they are married and want to present a united front. But that doesn't necessarily mean she has to change her name. It's a personal decision. The husband might not be wrong in feeling that using the married name would symbolize their unity, but he's not necessarily right to expect her to do so. It's a matter of perspective. But given that she has her reasons and it's her personal achievement, he might be overstepping by feeling it's a betrayal if she doesn't. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her choice and is framing it as a breach of unity rather than a personal preference.\n"
