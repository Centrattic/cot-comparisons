Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a wife graduating dental school and wanting her doctoral certificate to have her maiden name, while the husband (the author) expects her to use their married name. The husband feels it's a betrayal of their unity, as they've been married for most of her schooling and both made sacrifices. The wife argues she worked hard and paid for most of her tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family's name.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the husband's expectations are reasonable. Using a maiden name on academic credentials is a personal choice. Many people choose to keep their maiden name for various reasons, including professional continuity or family tradition. The husband's concern is about perception\u2014others might think they married after she completed her work. But that's an assumption; academic credentials typically reflect the name at the time of graduation, not the marital status. \n\nThe husband's argument is about joint sacrifice and unity. While their partnership is commendable, the decision to use a married name isn't a requirement for acknowledging shared efforts. The wife's right to choose her name is her own, especially in a professional context. The husband's feeling of betrayal might stem from a desire for public recognition of their relationship, but that's not something he can enforce on her.\n\nThe wife's counter is valid too. She's balancing work and school, paid for her tuition, and the husband wasn't in class with her. She's entitled to take pride in her achievements under her own name choice. The husband's perspective is about unity, but the wife's choice doesn't negate their shared journey. It's possible to support each other without requiring a name change.\n\nIn many cultures, the expectation for women to take their husband's name is decreasing, and individual choice is more respected. The husband's insistence might be based on traditional views that the wife's name should reflect her marital status, which is not universally accepted. The wife's autonomy in this decision is important. The husband's feelings are valid, but he's not in the wrong necessarily if he's trying to express his feelings of shared effort. However, the core issue is about the wife's right to choose her name, which the husband is trying to influence based on their relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The husband's expectations might not consider the wife's autonomy, but he's not necessarily in the wrong because he's coming from a place of wanting to celebrate their unity. However, the wife's choice is her right, so the husband's stance could be seen as overstepping. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the wife's right to choose her name is her own, and the husband is imposing his views on her. Alternatively, B (No) if the husband's feelings are seen as valid in the context of their relationship. But I think the key point is the wife's autonomy, so the husband is in the wrong for expecting her to use the married name. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
