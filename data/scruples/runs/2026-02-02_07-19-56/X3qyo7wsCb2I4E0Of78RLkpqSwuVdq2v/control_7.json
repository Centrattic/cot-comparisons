Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife is graduating dental school, and she wants to use the married name in practice but keep her maiden name on the certificate. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married through most of her schooling and both made sacrifices. He's concerned others might think they married after she completed her work. The wife counters that she's the one working full-time and paying for most tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family name.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's feelings of shared sacrifice and the wife's emphasis on her personal achievements and contributions. The husband's argument is about unity and shared effort, while the wife's is about individual merit and recognition.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, using the married name is common, but in others, keeping the maiden name is also acceptable. However, the situation here isn't about a name change but the certificate's name. The husband's main issue is perception\u2014he doesn't want others to think the marriage happened after her education. The wife's point is about her personal investment.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings about unity, which is valid. However, imposing his expectations on her certificate might be overstepping. The wife has the right to use her name as she chooses, especially since it's her achievement. The husband's desire for unity is understandable, but it shouldn't override her personal choice. The fact that they're in a happy marriage and discussing this together suggests they can find a compromise. But the core issue is whether the husband's expectation is unjust. Since he's asking her to change her name for his sake, that might be where he's at fault. He needs to respect her autonomy in this matter.\n\nSo the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her right to use her maiden name on her certificate, which is her personal achievement, and his concern about perception might be more about his own pride than her actual contribution.\n"
