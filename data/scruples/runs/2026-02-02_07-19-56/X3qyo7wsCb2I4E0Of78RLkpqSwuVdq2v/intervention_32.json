Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate. The situation is that the wife wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity, considering they've been married through most of her education and he's supported her financially and with housework. She argues that she's the one working full-time and paying for most tuition, and that he wasn't in school with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their perspectives. The husband is emphasizing joint sacrifice and unity, feeling that using her maiden name on the certificate might imply she wasn't part of the marriage during her studies. The wife is focusing on her personal achievement and the fact that she's the one handling the work and tuition costs. \n\nI should think about societal norms here. Traditionally, it was common for women to change their names, but nowadays, there's more flexibility and respect for personal choice. The wife might want to honor her family or professional identity with her maiden name, especially if she's paying for the certificate. On the other hand, the husband's concern about public perception (people thinking they married after her education) is valid, but maybe not sufficient reason to impose his will.\n\nAlso, the dynamic of their relationship: the husband is financially supporting her, but she's the one working full-time and in school. This could be a point of tension. The husband might feel he's contributed more, but the wife is emphasizing her own efforts. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If he's pressuring her to use his name on the certificate, that could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. Academic achievements are personal, and the choice of name is hers unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's argument about unity is about perception, but the wife has the right to choose how she presents her name. However, if they value unity, maybe they should find a middle ground, like using the married name on the certificate as well. But if the wife is adamant, the husband might need to respect her decision. \n\nConsidering all that, the husband's insistence might be overstepping. The certificate is her academic title, and while shared sacrifices are important, the name choice is personal. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the husband being in the wrong.\n"
