Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they want their wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife is graduating from dental school, and she wants to use her married name in practice but keep her maiden name on the certificate. The husband feels this is a betrayal of their unity because they've been married through most of her schooling, she's been supported financially and with housework, and he wants the certificate to reflect their joint effort. She argues that she's the one working full-time and paying most of the tuition, so she deserves the recognition with her family's name.\n\nHmm. The husband's perspective is about shared sacrifice and wanting to show their unity. The wife's point is about her personal achievements and her family's recognition. It's a classic conflict between shared identity and individual recognition. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author (husband) is in the wrong. But why? Well, maybe because using a maiden name on a certificate is a personal choice, and the husband's expectation could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. On the other hand, the husband might feel that since they worked together, the certificate should reflect their partnership. \n\nBut in many cases, professionals do choose to use their married names in practice while keeping maiden names on documents for legal or other reasons. It's possible that the certificate's name is a legal requirement, and the practice name is separate. The husband's concern about others assuming they married after her education might be overblown, especially if the certificate's name isn't the one used publicly. \n\nThe wife's argument is about her personal effort and her family's name. It's her achievement, so she might have the right to choose how to present her name. The husband's expectation might not consider her personal ties to her family name. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the husband could be in the wrong if he's not respecting her autonomy. However, his feelings of wanting to show unity are valid. But the decision to use a maiden name isn't necessarily a betrayal. It's more about differing priorities. \n\nBut the key here is if the husband is in the wrong. Since the wife is making a choice that's personal, and the husband is pressuring her to change it for his sake, that might be where he's wrong. The answer might be A. However, some might argue B, thinking that they should be unified. But I think the autonomy aspect tips it towards A.\n"
