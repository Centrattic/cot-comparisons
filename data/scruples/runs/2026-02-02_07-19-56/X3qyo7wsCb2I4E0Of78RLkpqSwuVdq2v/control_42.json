Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding his wife wanting to use her maiden name on her doctoral certificate. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He wants her to use the married name on the certificate because he feels it's a betrayal to their unity. They've been married through most of her schooling, shared sacrifices, and he thinks people might assume they married after her achievements if the name is maiden. He wants to celebrate it together.\n\nHis wife's side: She's working full-time and studying, paid for most of her tuition herself, and feels she deserves the recognition with her family's name. She didn't have him in class with her, so she wants her own recognition.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Let me consider cultural norms. In many places, people choose their name on academic certificates based on personal preference. It's their right to choose, especially since the name on a certificate is often a personal decision. The author is emphasizing unity and shared sacrifice, which is valid, but maybe he's not respecting her individual identity and her family's legacy.\n\nThe wife's point about paying for her tuition and working full-time suggests she sees this as her achievement. The author might be projecting his own values onto her, expecting her to conform to a shared identity. However, it's possible to have both unity and individual recognition. Maybe the author is overreacting because the certificate name doesn't directly impact their relationship or the recognition of their shared efforts.\n\nAlso, the certificate's name is a personal choice. Even if she uses her maiden name, it doesn't negate the sacrifices he made. The perception of others is part of the author's concern, but that's an external factor. Her right to choose her name should be respected as part of her identity. So, the author's insistence might be inconsiderate of her personal wishes and heritage.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the choice of name is her personal decision, and respecting her autonomy is important despite his feelings of shared sacrifice.\n"
