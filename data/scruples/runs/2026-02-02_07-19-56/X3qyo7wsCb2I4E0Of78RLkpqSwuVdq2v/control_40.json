Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author feels that using the maiden name might imply they got married after her academic achievements, which he sees as a betrayal of their unity. They've been married through most of her schooling, and he mentions shared sacrifices. On the other hand, the wife argues that she worked full-time, paid for her tuition, and that she deserves recognition of her own family's name since he wasn't in her classes.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many societies, it's common for married women to use their spouse's surname, but it's not a strict rule. Some women keep their maiden names professionally for various reasons, like career continuity or personal identity. The wife's choice might be about her personal pride and identity, separate from the marital relationship.\n\nThe author's perspective is about unity and shared sacrifice. He wants to publicly acknowledge their partnership through the use of a shared surname. However, the wife's stance is about her individual contributions and her right to use her family's name. \n\nIt's important to note that the couple is discussing this together, not fighting. They have a happy marriage, so this seems more like a difference in values rather than a conflict. The question is whether the author's expectation is unreasonable. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the wife has the right to choose her professional name. Academic achievements are personal milestones, and using her maiden name doesn't negate the support he provided. The author's concern about others perceiving their marriage timing is valid, but that's more about perception than actual fact. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer likely isn't black and white. However, the author's insistence on changing her name could be seen as dismissing her personal choice and identity. The wife's right to her own name is a significant factor. So the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy, but I need to check if that's the case.\n"
