Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. In many cultures, changing one's name to the spouse's is a traditional practice, but it's not a universal expectation. The wife has a right to her own identity and achievements. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity, but that's a bit of a stretch. He's equating the name on the certificate with their joint effort, but the certificate is her academic achievement. She's using her married name professionally, which shows she values their unity in her career, but keeping her maiden name on the certificate is about personal identity and family heritage.\n\nHe mentions sacrifices he's made, like financial support and housework. While those are valid, the wife is also making significant sacrifices by balancing full-time work and school. She paid for most of her tuition, which supports her argument that it's her personal achievement. The husband's main issue is about perception\u2014others might think they married after her success. But that's an assumption; the certificate's name doesn't necessarily reflect the timeline of their marriage.\n\nThe wife's stance is about her right to her name and the pride in her family's legacy. The husband is projecting his feelings of shared effort onto the name choice. It's a matter of conflicting values. The husband's reasoning is from a place of wanting to publicly display their unity, but the wife's choice is about personal and familial identity. Neither is entirely wrong, but the husband might not be considering her perspective fully. The key is mutual respect for each other's priorities. The husband's insistence might come off as not valuing her autonomy, which could be seen as in the wrong.\n"
