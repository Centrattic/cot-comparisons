Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's wife is graduating dental school and wants to use their married last name when practicing, but she plans to have her doctoral certificate under her maiden name. The author feels this is a betrayal because they've been married for most of her education time, both made sacrifices (like the author's income supporting them, and the wife dealing with school and housework), and he wants her to use their shared name to show unity. The wife argues that she works and studies full-time, paid for most of her tuition, and the author didn't attend classes, so she deserves to take pride in her family's name.\n\nHmm. First thought: the author's concern is about the appearance of when they got married. If the certificate has her maiden name, people might think they married after she earned the degree, which they didn't. But the wife's perspective is about her own achievements and her right to use her maiden name for the certificate. \n\nIn many cultures, people can choose to use either their maiden or married name on academic credentials. It's often a personal choice. The author is pushing for the married name as a symbol of their unity and shared sacrifice. But the wife has her own reasons. \n\nThe author might be projecting his feelings of shared effort onto the name choice. But does using a maiden name on the certificate negate their joint sacrifices? It might not. The wife could still acknowledge the support she received while using her chosen name. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. He's sacrificing financially and in terms of time, and feels his contributions aren't recognized. But the wife's desire to take pride in her own achievements is also valid. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting the married name? It depends on whether they've discussed and agreed on this. If they hadn't set this expectation before she started school, then maybe he's overstepping. The wife might not have considered his feelings, but he also might not have communicated his feelings clearly before this point. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have autonomy over their personal choices unless there's a mutual agreement. The author might be in the wrong if he's insisting on this without mutual discussion. The wife has a right to her own identity and achievements. The key is whether there was a prior agreement or if this is a new issue. Since they're discussing it now and it's a debate rather than a fight, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but his perspective is a bit controlling. \n\nThe main question is about being in the wrong. If the wife chose her maiden name without prior discussion, maybe she should have considered his feelings. But the author's expectation to have it on the certificate might be an overreach. The answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he's implying her choice is a betrayal, which might not be justified. Alternatively, B could be the case if the author's feelings are valid. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the analysis. The wife's right to choose her name on her academic certificate is a personal choice. The author's desire for unity is important, but it's not something that should override her autonomy. So A is the answer.\n"
