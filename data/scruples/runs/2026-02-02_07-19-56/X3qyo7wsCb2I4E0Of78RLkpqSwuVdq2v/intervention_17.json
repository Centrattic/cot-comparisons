Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe husband is upset that his wife wants to use her maiden name on her doctoral certificate instead of their married name. He feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married for most of her schooling, and he's supported her financially and through housework. The wife argues that she works full-time and pays for her tuition, and that he didn't attend classes with her, so she deserves the recognition.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is about identity and recognition. The husband wants the certificate to reflect their marital unity, but the wife wants to maintain her maiden name for personal or family reasons. \n\nI think the key points are about mutual respect and personal choice. The wife has every right to choose how she presents her name professionally, especially since it's her achievement. The husband's concern about others assuming they married later might be valid, but that's more about perception than the actual truth. They can address that together if it's a real issue. \n\nThe husband's argument that they did it together is true, but the certificate is her individual accomplishment. It's common for people to keep their maiden names, especially in their professional field. The wife's reasons for wanting to keep it\u2014family pride, personal identity\u2014should be respected. \n\nAlso, the husband's role in supporting her doesn't negate her own effort. She's working full-time and paying for tuition, which shows her commitment. The husband's feelings about unity are understandable, but they shouldn't override her personal choice. \n\nSo, in my opinion, the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and the significance of her personal identity in her professional achievements.\n"
