Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that since they've been married during most of her schooling and they both made sacrifices, using her maiden name on the certificate feels like a betrayal. He wants to show unity. The wife, on the other hand, argues that she works full-time, pays for most of her tuition, and wasn't in school with him, so she deserves to take pride in her family's name. They're in a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, the key points here are about unity vs. personal identity and contributions. The husband is emphasizing joint effort and the sacrifices they both made. The wife is focusing on her individual achievements and her family's name. \n\nIn many cultures, using a married name is common, but it's also a personal choice. The husband's reasoning is about showing unity, but the wife might see her name as part of her personal identity and achievement. The question is whether expecting her to change her name is a fair request or not. \n\nI should consider if the husband is overstepping by making this a condition. Since the wife is paying for her tuition and working, she might have a valid point about her own contributions. Also, the timing of when they got married is important. If they got married before she started school, using the married name could symbolize their unity, but if she used her maiden name first, changing it might not be expected. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the certificate's name would imply the work was done before marriage. The husband is concerned about people misunderstanding the timeline, but that's more about perception than the actual truth. The wife's argument is about her deserving recognition for her efforts. \n\nI think both have valid points. However, expecting her to change her name could be seen as disregarding her personal choice and identity. The husband's desire for unity is understandable, but it shouldn't override her right to present her achievements as she sees fit. So, maybe the answer is that the husband is in the wrong because he's imposing his expectations without considering her perspective and autonomy.\n"
