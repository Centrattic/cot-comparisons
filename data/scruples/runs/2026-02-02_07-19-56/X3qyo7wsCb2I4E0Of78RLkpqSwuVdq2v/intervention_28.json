Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband feels that using her maiden name might imply that they got married after she completed her education, which he sees as a betrayal of their shared sacrifices. He mentions that they've been married during most of her schooling and that he's supported them financially and with housework. He wants to celebrate their joint effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife wants to use her maiden name, possibly because she's taking pride in her family's legacy or her personal achievement. She's working full-time and attending school, paying for most of her tuition. She might see her name on the certificate as a personal accomplishment, not just a shared one. She also points out that the husband wasn't physically in class with her, so the recognition should be on her, especially since she's the one going through the rigorous process.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is wrong. Traditionally, some might argue that using the married name is about unity, but in modern times, there's a strong emphasis on individual choice and identity. The wife might feel that her academic achievement is her own, and using her maiden name is a way to honor her roots or her hard work. The husband's concern about perception is valid, but it's also important to respect her autonomy.\n\nThe husband's argument is based on shared sacrifice, which is genuine. However, expecting her to forgo her maiden name could be seen as dismissing her personal identity. The fact that they are discussing it amicably suggests they value each other's perspectives, but the decision ultimately rests on her right to choose her name on an academic credential. \n\nIn many cases, individuals choose to keep their maiden names for various reasons, including professional consistency if they've used it previously. The husband's desire to showcase their unity is understandable, but it shouldn't override her personal choice, especially since she's the one receiving the degree. The key here is respect for individual autonomy versus shared identity. Since the wife is asserting her right to use her maiden name, the husband's expectation might be infringing on that right. Therefore, the answer is likely that the husband is in the wrong.\n"
