Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that since they've been married through most of her schooling, and they've both made sacrifices, she should use their shared last name on the certificate as a sign of unity. He's concerned that people might think they got married after she earned her degree if her certificate has her maiden name. He sees it as a joint achievement.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she works full-time while attending school, pays for most of her tuition, and that he wasn't in school with her. She wants to take pride in her family's name and believes she deserves recognition for her own efforts. They're both in a happy marriage and this is more of a discussion than a fight.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here, it's important to respect individual choices and contributions. The wife's desire to use her maiden name might stem from wanting to honor her family or her personal achievements. The husband's perspective is about shared experiences and unity. \n\nIn many cases, using a married name on academic certificates isn't a requirement. People often choose to use either name based on personal or family reasons. The key here is mutual respect. If the husband feels it's about unity, he might need to recognize that his wife's choice doesn't negate their shared sacrifices. Conversely, the wife's pride in her own achievements should be acknowledged. \n\nThe fact that they're discussing this together suggests they value each other's opinions. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the husband might be in the wrong if he's imposing his expectations without considering her reasons. However, if the discussion is about how to present their unity, maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's expecting her to use a name she's uncomfortable with, potentially disregarding her wishes. But maybe B (No) because he's coming from a place of wanting to show their unity. Hmm. It's tricky. But in terms of autonomy, the wife has the right to choose her name on her certificate. So the husband might be overstepping by expecting her to change it for his sense of unity. So A.\n"
