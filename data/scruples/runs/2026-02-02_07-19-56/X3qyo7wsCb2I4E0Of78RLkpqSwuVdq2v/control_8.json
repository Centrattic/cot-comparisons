Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels it's a betrayal to their unity because they've been married during most of her schooling. He mentions their joint sacrifices\u2014his income supporting them, her doing housework, etc. He's concerned about others perceiving they got married after her achievements.\n\nThe wife argues that she works full-time, goes to school full-time, paid for most of her tuition, and since he isn't the one attending classes, she deserves the recognition under her family's name. They have a happy marriage and are discussing it as a debate, not a fight.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Traditionally, there might be expectations about adopting a married name, but societal norms have evolved. The key here is whether his expectation is reasonable. The husband's feelings about unity and shared sacrifice are valid, but the wife's perspective on her personal achievements and identity is also important.\n\nHe's expecting her to use his last name on an academic certificate, which is a personal choice. While they've shared sacrifices, the certificate is her academic accomplishment. The wife's desire to maintain her maiden name might be about preserving her personal identity and the effort she's put into her education. The husband's concern about others misunderstanding their timeline is practical, but maybe that's something they can address through communication rather than changing her name.\n\nIs it right for him to expect her to use his name? It could be seen as not respecting her autonomy, especially if she's clear about her reasons. However, his feelings about their partnership are also genuine. The issue is balancing mutual respect with individual rights.\n\nIn modern contexts, people often choose names based on personal preference, regardless of marital status. The husband's argument that they did it together might be valid in terms of support, but the certificate is her academic title. The wife's argument about her own contributions and the recognition of her efforts under her family's name is also strong.\n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong per se, but his perspective might need to consider the wife's autonomy more. However, the core question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" If he's making a reasonable request based on their shared life, maybe not. But if he's imposing his will without considering her valid reasons, then he might be. However, the text says they are discussing it together and it's more of a debate. The wife's reasons are about her own work and identity. So perhaps the answer is that he is not in the wrong (B), but this is nuanced. However, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, the expectations can vary. The husband's stance is based on shared effort, but the wife's choice is about personal identity and family name. So, depending on cultural norms, but in modern times, using a maiden name on academic certificates is a personal choice. Therefore, the husband's expectation might be seen as overstepping, but the answer isn't clear-cut. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's expressing his feelings and the wife has her own valid reasons, but he's not forcing her to change her name entirely\u2014she's using the married name professionally\u2014maybe he's not wrong. The certificate is academic, and she's choosing to use the married name in practice. So perhaps B is the answer.\n"
