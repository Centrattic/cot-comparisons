Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use her married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The context is that they've been married through most of her education, and he feels it's a betrayal to their unity. She argues that she deserves the recognition under her family name because she worked hard and paid for most of her tuition.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects here. In many Western contexts, women often retain their maiden names on academic credentials, especially if they had started their education before marriage. It's a matter of personal identity and the timeline of achievements. The wife might have established her academic identity under her maiden name, and changing it now could be seen as erasing that history. \n\nBut the husband's perspective is about unity and pride in their shared sacrifices. He's supporting her financially and handling most housework, so he wants the certificate to reflect the married name as a symbol of their partnership. However, the decision to use a maiden name is typically a personal one, and academic institutions might not allow name changes after the degree is conferred unless there's a legal change. Even if possible, she might prefer her maiden name for professional consistency.\n\nThe key points are: the wife's right to her name, the husband's desire for unity, and the actual feasibility of changing the name. The husband is not wrong in expressing his feelings, but expecting her to change her name could be seen as dismissive of her identity and autonomy. It's a sensitive issue where both have valid points. The wife might have a right to her name as it's part of her personal and professional history. The husband's feelings about unity are understandable, but it's not fair to pressure her into using a married name if it's her choice to keep her maiden name, especially if she's worked independently for it. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Because while his feelings are valid, the decision to use a maiden name is her personal choice and doesn't negate their shared sacrifices. Pressuring her to change it for symbolic reasons might overlook her autonomy. However, maybe there's a middle ground where they can both feel the sacrifice is recognized without changing the name. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that she's already using the married name in practice is a compromise, so the certificate name might not matter as much. But if he's concerned about perception, maybe they can discuss that. However, the expectation that she must change her name is where the issue lies. So the answer would be A.\n"
