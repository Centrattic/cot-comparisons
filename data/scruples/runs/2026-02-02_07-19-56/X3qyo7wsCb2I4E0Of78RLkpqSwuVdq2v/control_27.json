Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to use the married last name professionally but her maiden name on the certificate. The author feels this is a betrayal of their unity, given they've been married during her schooling and both made sacrifices. The wife argues she should take pride in her own achievements and family name.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about name choice and perceived ownership of the accomplishment. The author is prioritizing joint unity and shared sacrifice, while the wife values her individual identity and contributions. \n\nIn many cultures, it's common for women to hyphenate names or use maiden names on academic credentials, especially if they've been using the married name professionally. The key here is mutual respect. The author's concern is about public perception and how the certificate might be interpreted, but that's more about assumptions others might make, which the author is perhaps projecting. \n\nThe wife's argument is valid because academic credentials are typically associated with the name used during the time of study. If the university records her as using her maiden name, then that would be on the certificate. But if she's using the married name professionally, maybe there's a way to address that. However, the author is asking her to use the married name on the certificate, which might not be feasible if the records are under her maiden name. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's request is based on a desire for unity, but it's important to recognize that personal identity and professional branding are individual choices. The wife's decision to use her maiden name on the certificate doesn't negate the shared sacrifices. The author might be conflating the name on the certificate with the shared effort. It's possible he's not in the wrong if his intention is to honor their unity, but the wife's right to her name and individuality is also important. However, the author's stance could be seen as not respecting her personal choice, especially if she's made sacrifices herself. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might not be in the wrong if his intentions are good, but the wife's perspective is equally valid. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife is making her own choice, and the author's concern is about perception rather than the actual shared effort, it's a matter of mutual understanding. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance here. However, given the context of their joint sacrifices, the author's request could be seen as reasonable, especially if they have a happy marriage and it's a debate rather than a fight. So the answer is B.\n"
