Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The husband feels that using her maiden name on the certificate might imply they got married after her academic achievements, which he sees as a lack of recognition of their joint sacrifices. They've been married during most of her education, and he's supported them financially and with housework.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife argues that she's the one working full-time and going to school, paying for most of her tuition, and since he wasn't in class with her, she deserves to take pride in her family's name. They have a happy marriage and this is more of a debate than a fight.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, professional credentials often use the name the individual prefers. Using a maiden name is a personal choice and doesn't negate the spouse's contributions. The husband's concern about others assuming they married after her success is a bit of an assumption. The wife's right to choose her name, especially given her personal sacrifices, is important here. \n\nHowever, the husband's feelings about unity are valid, but they need to communicate and respect each other's perspectives. The key point is that while the husband's feelings are understandable, the wife has the right to use her maiden name if that's her preference. The husband might be projecting his feelings onto others, thinking people will misinterpret the name, but that's an assumption. The wife's argument about her own contributions and the pride in her family's name is a legitimate reason.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The husband is overstepping by expecting his wife to use their married name on an academic certificate, which is her personal achievement. The wife's choice to use her maiden name is valid, and the husband should respect that, even if it's different from his expectations. The focus on unity shouldn't override her right to use her preferred name.\n"
