Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband and wife discussing whether the wife should put her married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The husband feels it's a betrayal of their unity since they've been married through her schooling, and he's contributed a lot financially and with housework. The wife argues she worked full-time, paid for most of her tuition, and that she deserves the recognition of her own name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's argument is about unity and shared sacrifice. He sees the maiden name as implying that the achievements were hers alone, not theirs as a couple. The wife, on the other hand, is emphasizing her individual effort and financial contribution, wanting to take pride in her family's name (assuming her maiden name is her family name). \n\nNow, societal norms vary. Some people view using one's maiden name on academic credentials as a matter of personal identity and professional branding. Others might see it as a way to honor family heritage. However, the key here is the couple's own values and agreement. The husband feels it's a betrayal, but the wife doesn't see it that way. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting her to use his name.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the wife has a right to use her maiden name if she chooses, especially if it's her preference and she's made significant contributions. The husband's feelings of betrayal might stem from a desire for the couple to be seen as a unit, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. However, expecting her to use his name could be seen as imposing his identity on her achievements. \n\nThe situation mentions they're married for most of her schooling, so the husband sees their partnership as integral. However, the wife's argument is valid in that she earned the degree through her own work. The answer might depend on whether using her maiden name is seen as disregarding their partnership. But since the wife is not changing her name on the certificate to imply a different marital status, maybe the husband's concern is misplaced. \n\nThe husband's main issue is perception\u2014others might think they married after her achievements. But that's a social assumption, not a factual one. The wife's right to her name is important. The husband's feelings are valid, but the expectation might be unreasonable. So, the author (the husband) could be in the wrong if he's not respecting her choice based on her own merits. But if they are in a joint effort and he wants to celebrate together, it's a matter of compromise. However, the wife's right to her name seems to outweigh the husband's preference here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
