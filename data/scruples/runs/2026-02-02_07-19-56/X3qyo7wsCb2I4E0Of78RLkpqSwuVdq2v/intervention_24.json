Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use her married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around this. In many societies, it's common for individuals to use their maiden names professionally, especially if they've built a career under that name. The wife has been in school for years, working full-time and paying for her tuition. She might have established her identity and professional reputation under her maiden name. Changing it could cause confusion in her field, like dental practice.\n\nThen there's the aspect of joint sacrifice. The husband mentions they both sacrificed a lot, including financial support and household responsibilities. He feels it's a betrayal because he sees the certificate as a joint achievement. However, the wife's perspective is that she earned the degree through her own efforts, attending classes and managing her studies. She might feel that using her maiden name is her right, especially since she's the one who directly contributed to earning the degree.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect for each other's perspectives. The husband's desire for unity is valid, but the wife's right to her own professional identity is also important. Expecting her to change her name on the certificate could be seen as disregarding her autonomy. The husband might be projecting his own values onto her, not considering her personal needs and existing professional identity.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's argument that others might assume they got married after her education could be a concern, but it's more about perception rather than reality. The wife's stance is about her own contributions and pride in her family's name, which is her right. The husband might not have physically attended classes, but his support is still valid, yet the degree is her academic achievement.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's expectation might be stemming from a place of wanting to feel included and to show unity, but he's not considering her autonomy and professional identity. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's imposing his expectations without fully acknowledging her perspective.\n"
