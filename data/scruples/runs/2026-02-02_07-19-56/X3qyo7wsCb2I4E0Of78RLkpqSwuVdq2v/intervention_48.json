Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the man is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to use the married name professionally but keep the maiden name on the certificate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been married during most of her schooling, and they've both made sacrifices. The husband feels it's a betrayal to use her maiden name on the certificate, implying it might look like they married after she earned it. The wife argues she worked hard, paid for her tuition, and feels her family name should be recognized.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal choice and identity, individuals often choose to use either their maiden or married name for professional recognition. The husband's concern is about perception\u2014others might assume they married after her achievements. But the wife's stance is about her own contributions and identity. \n\nIs there a cultural or societal norm that dictates this? In many cases, people do use their married names professionally, but it's also common to keep the maiden name for various reasons, including professional continuity. However, the certificate itself is a personal document, and the name on it might not affect her practice if she's using the married name in her work. \n\nThe husband's argument is about unity and shared sacrifice. But the wife is emphasizing her individual effort and financial responsibility. It's a delicate balance between partnership and personal achievement. The fact that they're discussing it together and not fighting suggests mutual respect, but the husband's expectation could be seen as imposing his view on her personal decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, pressuring someone to adopt a married name on an academic certificate might infringe on her autonomy. The certificate reflects her academic journey, and using her maiden name doesn't negate the partnership. The husband's concern is valid in terms of perception, but the wife's right to choose her name is a personal choice. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong by expecting her to conform to his preference without considering her perspective fully.\n"
