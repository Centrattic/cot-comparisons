Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to use their married name on her doctoral certificate instead of her maiden name.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is graduating dental school and wants to practice under the married name but have the certificate in her maiden name. The husband feels this is a betrayal of their unity, emphasizing their joint sacrifices during her schooling. She argues that she's the one working full-time and attending school, paid her own tuition, and that he wasn't there during classes, so she deserves the recognition under her family name.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is about how others might perceive their relationship if the certificate has her maiden name, implying they married after she earned the degree. He wants to showcase their unity through the shared last name. On the other hand, the wife might value her personal achievement and her family heritage, especially if her family's name is important to her. She might also feel that the husband is not recognizing her individual effort and financial responsibility in paying for her tuition.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for expecting the married name on the certificate? Well, in many cultures, people choose their name on academic certificates based on personal or family preferences. The husband's argument is about unity and public perception, but the wife's choice is about personal pride and recognition. It's possible that the husband is overstepping by making it a condition, especially since the certificate is her achievement. However, his feelings about unity are valid too.\n\nBut then, does the husband have a right to dictate the name on her certificate? Typically, the individual has the right to choose their name for professional credentials. The husband's insistence might be imposing his expectations on her personal choice. The wife's argument that she's the one primarily handling the work and school suggests that the achievement is hers, even with their shared sacrifices. The husband's financial support is significant, but the certificate is a personal academic credential.\n\nAlso, the wife paying for her own tuition and working full-time while attending school might mean she sees the degree as her own accomplishment, deserving to be under her family name. The husband's concern about others' assumptions could be addressed through other means, like explaining their situation if asked, rather than changing the name on the certificate.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's stance might not consider the wife's right to choose how she presents her personal achievements. While his feelings about unity are understandable, the decision should ultimately respect her autonomy. Therefore, the author (husband) might be in the wrong.\n"
