Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. \n\nShe feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. \n\nWe have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's wife is graduating dental school and wants her doctoral certificate to have her maiden name instead of the married name she uses professionally. The author feels this is a betrayal of their unity and doesn't want people to think they got married after her achievements. The wife argues she works full-time and pays for her tuition, so she deserves the recognition under her family name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is emphasizing shared sacrifice and unity in their marriage. They've been through a lot together, and he wants public recognition of her achievements to reflect their joint effort. On the other hand, the wife is asserting her own identity and the fact that she's the one directly responsible for her education and career. She might see her name as a personal achievement and a part of her family's heritage.\n\nI should think about cultural norms and personal choice here. In many societies, individuals choose to use either their maiden or married names for professional credentials. It's often a personal decision based on how they want to present themselves. The author's concern about perception is valid, but maybe he's overemphasizing the symbolic aspect. The wife's argument is about her own contributions and right to her name. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are both happy and this is more of a debate than a fight. They're working through it together, which is positive. The key here is whether the author's expectations are reasonable. He might be projecting his feelings of shared sacrifice onto the need for the certificate to reflect their unity. However, the certificate is about her academic achievement, which she earned through her own work, even if supported by the marriage. \n\nI think the author's position is coming from a place of wanting recognition for their partnership, but the decision should ultimately be the wife's. It's her name to choose, and the fact that she's paying for the tuition might give her the right to decide. The author's feelings are valid, but he might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy in this matter. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
