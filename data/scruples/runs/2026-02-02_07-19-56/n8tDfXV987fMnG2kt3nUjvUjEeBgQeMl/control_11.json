He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: their infant is crawling and putting everything in their mouth. Keeping the floors clean is important for the baby's health. They hire professional cleaners to maintain this, so it's a considered effort. The parents offer to babysit twice a month, which is appreciated, but the mother's refusal to remove shoes creates a conflict.\n\nThe mother is being asked to take off her shoes, and even offered alternatives like slippers. But she refuses, citing cold feet. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply. The key here is the balance between respecting the home's rules and the family's needs.\n\nIn such cases, the homeowners have the right to set their own house rules. The mother is a guest, and guests are expected to follow the host's rules, especially when there's a valid health reason. The author is not being unreasonable; they've made accommodations (slippers, etc.) but the mother is not cooperating. The author's stance is about maintaining a clean environment for their child, which is a priority. The mother's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, but the author is not in the wrong for enforcing their rules. So the answer should be B.\n"
