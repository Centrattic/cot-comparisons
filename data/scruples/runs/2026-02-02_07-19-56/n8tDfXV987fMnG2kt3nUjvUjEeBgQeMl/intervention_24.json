He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being asked.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the health and safety of the infant. The author has an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. They've taken steps to keep the house clean, hiring professionals monthly. The mother's refusal to take off her shoes introduces dirt, rocks, grass, etc., which could be harmful to the baby. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't follow the rule.\n\nOn one hand, the mother is being offered alternatives like slippers or socks, but she refuses. She even states she'd rather fight than take her shoes off. The author is trying to maintain a clean environment for their baby, which is a valid concern. They also mention that they don't need the free babysitting, implying they're not in a position where they have to accept her help under bad terms.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is visiting twice a month after the baby is asleep, so the direct impact on the baby's presence isn't there during her visits. However, the aftermath of her visits leaves a mess that the author has to clean up, which adds to their stress and workload. The author's stance is that they're paying for cleaning services to mitigate this, so the mother's actions undermine that effort.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author has a legitimate reason for the no-shoes policy. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that affects the baby's health and the cleanliness of the home. The author is setting boundaries for their own home, which they have the right to do. The mother isn't being respectful of those boundaries despite being asked multiple times. \n\nWhile the mother's discomfort (cold feet) is a valid personal issue, the author's priorities are the baby's health and maintaining a clean home. Since the author has offered solutions and the mother still refuses, the author is within their rights to enforce the rule and possibly not allow her in if she doesn't comply. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's well-being. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
