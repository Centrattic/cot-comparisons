He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household. The main issue is with the author's mother refusing to take off her shoes when visiting, leading to dirt and debris in the house, which is a problem for an infant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: an infant crawling and putting things in their mouth, so cleanliness is a priority. They even hire cleaners to manage this. The mother, on the other hand, is resistant to taking off her shoes, even when offered alternatives like slippers or socks. She's been asked directly but refuses, leading to the author considering excluding her from visits.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, homeowners can set rules for their house. Hygiene is especially important with a baby. The mother's refusal causes a conflict. While the mother might feel her comfort is important (cold feet), the author's health and safety concerns for the baby are significant. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries. They\u2019ve tried accommodations, but the mother isn't complying. The author is within their rights to enforce the rules, even if it means limiting visits. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
