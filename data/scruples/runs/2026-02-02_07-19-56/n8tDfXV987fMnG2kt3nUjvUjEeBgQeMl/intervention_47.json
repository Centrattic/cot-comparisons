He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a no-shoes policy at home due to an infant crawling and putting things in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers to keep the floors clean, and the author's parents refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main concern is the health and safety of their baby. They have a valid reason for the no-shoes policy, especially with a crawling infant. The parents are even paying for regular cleaning to maintain cleanliness. The mother-in-law (the author's mother) refuses to comply, even when offered alternatives like slippers or socks. She's causing a mess that's counteracting the cleaning efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that her comfort (feet getting cold) is important. However, this seems like a personal preference that's conflicting with the household rules. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply, which is a significant step. The question is whether this action is justified or if the author is overreacting.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. I need to evaluate if the author is being unreasonable. The key points are the baby's health, the effort to maintain cleanliness, and the refusal to comply despite alternatives. The author is trying to enforce their home rules, which they have the right to do. The mother's refusal is creating a problem that affects the baby's environment. The author's response might be strict, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of prioritizing their child's well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
