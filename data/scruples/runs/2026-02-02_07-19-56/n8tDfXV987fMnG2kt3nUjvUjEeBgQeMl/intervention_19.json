He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes household with an infant, and the parents are upset because their mother keeps wearing shoes despite being asked. The author wants to tell her she can't come over if she doesn't take them off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has a no-shoes rule to keep their home clean, especially because their baby crawls and puts things in their mouth. They have professional cleaners, but the mother-in-law's shoes track in dirt, rocks, grass, etc., which they have to clean up afterward. The mother-in-law is being offered alternatives like socks or slippers but refuses. The author is considering cutting her off as a babysitter because of this.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me break it down. The main issue is about household rules and respecting them. The author's reasoning is valid because they have a legitimate health concern for their baby. They're also providing options, which shows they're making an effort to accommodate the mother's comfort. However, the mother is not respecting their rules and is being inflexible. The author is using a specific service (cleaners) to manage the dirt, but even so, the mother's shoes add to the problem. They're not asking her to do much\u2014just remove shoes, which is a common practice in many homes. The mother's refusal seems unreasonable here.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother has her own reasons for not taking off shoes, but in the story, she's given alternatives and still refuses. The author is trying to balance gratitude for the help with maintaining a clean environment for their baby. The question is whether the author is being too strict. Since the baby's safety and hygiene are at stake, and they're already paying for cleaning services, their request to remove shoes is reasonable. The mother isn't respecting their home's rules, so the author has a right to enforce them. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
