  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home with an infant. The parents have a valid reason: the baby crawls and puts things in his mouth, so they want to keep the floors clean. They have cleaners to maintain this.\n\nThe parents' own parents visit twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, which is appreciated, but the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong by answering A or B. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, the author's reasons seem reasonable\u2014protecting their baby's health and maintaining cleanliness. They've tried offering alternatives like slippers. The mother-in-law is being inflexible and not respecting the household rules, which are in place for a good reason. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged on how reasonable their expectations are. The author isn't unreasonable here. The mother-in-law's refusal is causing a problem, and the author is standing their ground. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
