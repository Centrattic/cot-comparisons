He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being offered alternatives. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has an infant who's crawling and putting everything in their mouth. They've set up a no-shoes policy to keep the house clean, hiring cleaners monthly. The parents babysit twice a month, but the mother refuses to take off her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is considering not inviting her mother over if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health and safety of the baby, the established household rules, and the mother's refusal to follow them despite being asked and offered alternatives. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the dirt from shoes is a health hazard for the baby. They've taken steps to maintain cleanliness, but the mother's actions undermine that effort. The author is setting boundaries to protect their child. \n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, people often side with the person setting boundaries, especially when it's about a child's well-being. The mother might be seen as being inconsiderate, but the author is enforcing their own home rules. The alternatives offered (socks, slippers) are reasonable, and the mother's refusal is non-negotiable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being too strict or not accommodating enough. But considering the baby's health and the author's efforts to maintain cleanliness, it's more about protecting a vulnerable family member. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No) because the author is within their rights to enforce their household rules, especially for the sake of their child's health.\n"
