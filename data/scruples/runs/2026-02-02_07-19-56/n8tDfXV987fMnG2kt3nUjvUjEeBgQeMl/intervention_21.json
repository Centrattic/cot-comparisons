He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. The parents have housekeepers to keep the floors clean, but the author's mother refuses to take her shoes off when visiting, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern for their baby's health and hygiene. They're paying for cleaning services, which they might be doing specifically to reduce the amount of dirt and germs the baby is exposed to. It makes sense they want to enforce a no-shoes rule to maintain that cleanliness.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is visiting twice a month, which might be a small number of times. She's being offered alternatives like slippers or socks but refuses them. The author is considering cutting off visits if she doesn't comply. The question is whether the author is being too strict or if they're justified in their stance.\n\nI should think about cultural norms here. In some cultures, not removing shoes is common, but in others, it's expected. The author's policy is a personal choice for their home, so they have the right to set those rules. However, the mother is a guest, and maybe the author could find a middle ground. But the baby's health is a priority, so maybe it's reasonable to enforce the rule strictly.\n\nThe author is also grateful for the babysitting but feels it's not being abused. They're not forcing the parents to babysit, so the mother's refusal to follow the house rule might be a valid reason to stop inviting her. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries for their home and child's well-being. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that affects the home environment. So the answer is B.\n"
