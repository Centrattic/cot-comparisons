He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes household because they have an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. They have house cleaners and a mud room setup to keep the floors clean. The parents come over twice a month to babysit, but the mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked and offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is considering telling her not to come over if she won't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's position. They have a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: the health and safety of their baby. Crawling infants are exposed to whatever is on the floor, so keeping the floors as clean as they can be makes sense. They also mention hiring cleaners monthly, which adds to the effort they're putting into maintaining cleanliness. The parents are only helping twice a month, so it's not like they're relying heavily on them. The author is grateful but doesn't feel they're being taken advantage of. \n\nThen there's the mother's behavior. She's been asked directly and even offered alternatives, but she refuses, citing cold feet. She's even willing to fight about it. The author is left with the mess and the resulting stress. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting a boundary here.\n\nFrom a standpoint of personal boundaries and health, especially for a baby, it's reasonable to enforce a no-shoes policy. The mother is an adult, and while she has her own preferences (like keeping her shoes on for warmth), the host has the right to set rules for their home. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they're protecting their child. The mother's refusal to compromise, despite multiple offers, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe some might argue that the author should be more lenient. However, the author has already made exceptions (offering alternatives) and the mother isn't budging. The author's solution of not inviting her over if she doesn't comply seems like a reasonable consequence. They even mention that they don't need the free babysitting, so they're not forcing the parents to help. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the asshole here. They have a valid reason, made efforts to accommodate, and are now enforcing the rule for their baby's safety. The mother is the one not respecting the household rules. Answer B.\n"
