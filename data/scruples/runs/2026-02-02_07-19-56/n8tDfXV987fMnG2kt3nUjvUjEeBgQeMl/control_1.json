  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply even after being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. Keeping the house clean is a health concern here. They already have housekeepers to manage the floors, so they can't afford extra dirt from shoes. The parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep, which is the only help they get. The author is grateful but has clear boundaries.\n\nThe mother in question is refusing to take off her shoes despite being asked, even when given options like slippers or socks. She's insistent on her own way, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't follow the rules. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, setting boundaries in one's home is a personal choice. The mother's behavior is causing a problem, and the author is trying to protect their baby's health. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for clean shoes or alternatives. The mother's refusal without valid justification (other than personal discomfort) seems to ignore the host's needs. \n\nThe key points are the health of the baby and the effort to maintain a clean environment. The author's actions are about protecting their family's well-being. The mother isn't respecting the home rules, so the author is justified in enforcing them. No-shoes policies are common in many cultures, and providing alternatives shows consideration. The author isn't being uptight but necessary for their child's safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
