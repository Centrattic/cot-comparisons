He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes rule in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers to clean, but the author's own parents visit twice a month and refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked. The author is considering not inviting them over if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main issue is the no-shoes policy for health and cleanliness reasons, especially with a baby. The author is trying to protect their child from germs and dirt. The parents-in-question are the author's own parents, so there's a family dynamic involved. The parents are providing some help by babysitting, but the author isn't dependent on it and could pay someone else.\n\nThe parents are being offered alternatives like socks or slippers but refuse. They're insistent on wearing their shoes, leading to dirt in the house. The author is considering cutting them off if they don't comply.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have a valid reason for the no-shoes rule. Their health and their baby's well-being are at stake. The fact that they hire cleaners monthly shows they're proactive about cleanliness. The parents are being asked to follow the rule, and when they refuse despite alternatives, the author is within their rights to enforce their own home rules. \n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. The parents may feel that since they're helping out by babysitting, they should be exempt from the rule. However, the author isn't \"abusing the system\" and even orders them dinner. The parents' refusal to comply, even when given options, seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's response\u2014telling them they can't come over if they don't follow the rules\u2014seems reasonable. It's about setting boundaries to protect their home and baby. While it's a tough call, especially with family, the author isn't being unreasonable. The parents are the ones not respecting the established rules after being asked directly. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B."
