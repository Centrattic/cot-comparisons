He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a no-shoes policy in their home due to an infant crawling and putting everything in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers to clean the floors monthly, and the author's parents visit twice a month to babysit. The mother refuses to remove her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering not inviting her if she continues.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if the author is in the right or wrong here. \n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for the no-shoes policy: protecting their baby's health. Crawling babies are at risk of ingesting dirt and germs, so having a clean environment is a reasonable precaution. The author is even paying for professional cleaning, which shows they're proactive about maintaining cleanliness. \n\nThe mother-in-law's refusal to remove her shoes is problematic. She's being asked to respect the household rules, but she's not complying. The author has offered alternatives like slippers or socks, but she's still not cooperating. This is a recurring issue happening twice a month, leading to ongoing mess and potential health risks. \n\nThe author's response is to consider not inviting the mother-in-law if she doesn't follow the rule. It's a reasonable boundary to protect their home and child. The author isn't being ungrateful for the babysitting help, but they're prioritizing their baby's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law's stance is rigid. She's not willing to compromise, which might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author is asking if they're at fault for enforcing their home rules. \n\nIn terms of social norms, homeowners generally have the right to set rules for their space. The mother-in-law's actions are violating those rules, so the author is justified in setting boundaries. The key point is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the author has a valid reason and the mother-in-law isn't flexible, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
