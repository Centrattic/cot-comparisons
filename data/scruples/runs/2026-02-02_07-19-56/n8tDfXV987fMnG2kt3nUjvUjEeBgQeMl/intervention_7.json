He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts everything in their mouth. They have housekeepers to clean, but the author's mother refuses to take off her shoes even when asked, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes policy: their baby's health and safety. They're paying for regular cleaning, which is a significant expense. The parents are helping out by babysitting, so the author is grateful but also has boundaries. The mother-in-law is refusing to comply, even after being asked and offered alternatives like slippers. The author is considering cutting off visits if she doesn't comply.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be uncomfortable with the no-shoes policy, possibly due to cultural norms or personal preference. Feet getting cold could be a genuine concern. But the author's home is their space, and they have the right to set rules. However, is it reasonable to completely cut off family visits over this? The author might be seen as being strict, but the health of an infant is a serious matter. The mother's refusal to compromise might be the bigger issue here. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is understandable. \n\nI should also think about the alternatives the author has provided\u2014offering slippers or socks. If the mother still refuses, maybe the author is justified in enforcing their rules. The fact that the author is willing to pay someone else instead of relying on family suggests they aren't trying to take advantage but are prioritizing their child's well-being. \n\nIn summary, the author's main goal is to protect their baby, which is a strong justification. The mother's refusal to adapt to the household rules, despite being asked and offered solutions, complicates things. The author might be in the right to enforce their policy, even if it means limiting visits. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
