He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their house, especially because their mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the context: They have an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. They already take steps like hiring cleaners and keeping shoes outside. The parents come over twice a month as free babysitters, but the mother insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, from a health and safety standpoint, the author's reasoning is valid. Crawling babies are in contact with floors, which can be a health hazard if there's dirt or debris. The author is doing their best to maintain a clean environment, and the mother's actions are undermining that. They've made compromises (offering slippers, etc.) but the mother refuses. \n\nThe mother is being difficult, but does that make the author wrong for setting boundaries? The author is the host of the home and has the right to establish rules. They're not being unreasonable by asking guests to remove shoes, especially given the infant's situation. The fact that the mother is using the babysitting as a favor might also play into her feeling she's entitled to some leeway, but the author's priority is their child's well-being.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their household rules, especially when it's for a valid reason. The mother is being inconsiderate, but the host has the right to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
