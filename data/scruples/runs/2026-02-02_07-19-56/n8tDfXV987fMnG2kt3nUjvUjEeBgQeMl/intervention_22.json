He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a no-shoes policy in their home due to having an infant. The parents are visiting twice a month to babysit, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, even when alternatives like slippers are offered. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: their baby is crawling and putting everything in their mouth. Keeping the house clean is a health concern. They've already taken steps by hiring cleaners and asking guests to leave shoes at the door. The parents are supposed to help out, but the mother is being non-compliant, making the author's efforts ineffective. \n\nThe author's response is to consider banning the mother from visiting if she continues this behavior. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nLegally, the homeowner can set rules for their house, right? So if you invite someone over, you can ask them to follow certain rules. The mother's refusal could be seen as disrespectful, especially since she's been offered alternatives. The author is trying to protect their child's health and the cleanliness they've paid for. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, removing shoes is customary, others not so much. The mother might be coming from a different background where it's not a big deal. However, the author has communicated the rule clearly, and the mother is choosing not to comply, even when alternatives are available. That seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe author isn't refusing help; they mention they can pay someone else. So the issue isn't about getting help but maintaining hygiene. The parents are contributing by babysitting, but the mother's actions are undermining that. The author's stance is about hygiene and protecting their child. \n\nIn the AITA context, the question is whether the author is unreasonable. The author has a clear rule and is enforcing it for a legitimate reason. The mother is not respecting the household rules despite being asked. The author's response seems reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
