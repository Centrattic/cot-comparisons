He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home with an infant. The author is concerned about cleanliness because the baby crawls and puts things in his mouth. They have housekeepers to keep the floors clean, but the parents don't take off their shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering not inviting the parents over if they don't comply.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. Let me break this down. First, the author's reasons: their baby's health and hygiene. That's a valid concern. Infants are more susceptible to germs and dirt, so having a clean environment makes sense. The household's rules are to minimize contamination, which is reasonable. \n\nThen there's the parents' refusal. The mother is given alternatives like socks or slippers but insists on her shoes. The author has asked directly, even offered solutions, but the mother is firm. The author is frustrated because they're paying for cleaning services to keep the house clean, and the parents are undermining that effort. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, setting boundaries in your own home is generally acceptable. If the parents are unwilling to respect the rules, especially when it's for a child's safety, the author has the right to enforce that. The parents are getting free babysitting, which might make the situation more tense. The author isn't asking for much\u2014just to take off shoes, which is a common practice in many homes. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's health concern about cold feet could be a point, but the author has provided alternatives. If those aren't acceptable, maybe the mother should bring her own slippers. But since she refuses, the author has to decide whether to let the compromise fail.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They're trying to protect their child's health and their home's cleanliness. The parents are not cooperating despite being given options. The author's stance is about maintaining their household rules, which is their right. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
