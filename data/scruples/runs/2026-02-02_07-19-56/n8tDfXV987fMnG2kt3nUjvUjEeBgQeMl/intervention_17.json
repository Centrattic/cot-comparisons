He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially since their mother refuses to take them off even when asked, leading to dirt and mess.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. Keeping the house clean is crucial for a baby's health. They even hire housekeepers to maintain cleanliness, so the policy is part of their effort to minimize germs and dirt.\n\nThe parents come over twice a month to babysit while the author and husband have dinner. They're grateful for the help but don't want to be seen as taking advantage. They also provide dinner for the parents, which seems fair. However, the mother consistently ignores the no-shoes rule despite being offered alternatives like socks or slippers. She's adamant about it, even when asked directly. This is causing the author to find debris in the house the next day, which undermines their cleaning efforts.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing the mother to visit unless she complies. The author is considering cutting off the visits because the mother isn't respecting their home rules. The key points here are the health concern for the baby and the mother's refusal to accommodate a reasonable request. \n\nThe mother's stance is about her comfort (cold feet), but the author's rules are for the baby's safety. The author has made compromises (offering alternatives) but the mother hasn't. The parents are getting free babysitting, so the author isn't in the wrong for expecting them to follow the house rules. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being too strict, especially if the parents are helping out. But the core issue is the baby's well-being and the author's efforts to maintain a clean environment. The mother's refusal is a breach of the agreed-upon rules. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own household policies. The mother isn't respecting those boundaries, even after being given options. The answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
