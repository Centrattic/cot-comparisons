  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a no-shoes policy in their home due to an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. The parents have cleaners to keep the floors clean, but the author's mother refuses to take off her shoes when visiting, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering not inviting the mother over if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concern is the health and safety of their baby. They have a valid reason for the no-shoes policy, given the baby's habits. They've made accommodations for their mother, like offering slippers or socks, but the mother refuses. The author is setting boundaries about their home's rules, which is their right. However, the mother is their parent, so there might be a generational dynamic here.\n\nPossible angles: The author is enforcing a rule to protect their child, which is understandable. The mother is not respecting the home rules, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is considering cutting off visits, which might seem harsh, but given the circumstances, it could be justified. On the flip side, maybe the mother's discomfort with the policy is also a valid point, but the author's health concerns are more critical here.\n\nI need to check if the author overstepped. They've made efforts to accommodate the mother, but the mother is uncooperative. The author is within their rights to enforce their home rules. The mother's refusal adds unnecessary risk to the baby's environment. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a specific reason tied to their child's well-being. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
