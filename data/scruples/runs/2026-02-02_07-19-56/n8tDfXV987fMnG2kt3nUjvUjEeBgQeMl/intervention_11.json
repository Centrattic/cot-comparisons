He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong by maintaining a no-shoes policy in their home. The situation involves the author having an infant who crawls and mouths everything. They've implemented this policy to keep the house as clean as possible, given the baby's habits. They hire cleaners monthly and store shoes by the door. Their parents, who babysit twice a month, refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's concerns are valid: a crawling baby putting hands and objects in their mouth means cleanliness is crucial. The no-shoes rule is a reasonable precaution to prevent dirt, rocks, grass, etc., from entering the home. They've even offered alternatives like slippers or socks, showing they're trying to accommodate.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's refusal is causing conflict. She's being asked to take off her shoes, which she refuses, citing cold feet and being willing to fight. The author is frustrated because this undermines their efforts to maintain cleanliness, especially since they're paying for cleaning services. The author is considering excluding the mother until she complies.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the reasonableness of the policy and the author's response. The no-shoes rule is their own home's rule, and they have the right to set boundaries for their family's health and safety. The fact that they've tried offering alternatives shows they're not being unreasonable. The mother's refusal is a choice, and the author is within their rights to enforce their rules. However, the author's potential response of cutting off visits might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances\u2014especially with a baby's health in mind\u2014it's a justified measure to protect their home environment.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for the policy and are trying to accommodate while maintaining their standards. The mother's behavior is the issue here, not the author's enforcement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
