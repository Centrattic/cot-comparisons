He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes policy. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has an infant crawling around and putting things in his mouth. They have a no-shoes rule to keep the floors clean, which makes sense for a baby's health. They even hire cleaners monthly to handle the floors. So their reasoning is solid from a hygiene standpoint.\n\nThen their parents come over twice a month to babysit when the baby is asleep. The parents don't take off their shoes despite being asked, and they refuse offers of slippers or socks. The mother is adamant about not removing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply with the no-shoes rule.\n\nThe key points here are the health of the baby and the household's rules. The parents are providing a helpful service, but their refusal to follow the household rules is causing a problem. The author is trying to balance gratitude for the babysitting with maintaining their home's cleanliness.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a valid reason for the no-shoes policy. They've made accommodations (slippers, socks) but the mother refuses. The author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health, which is a priority. Cutting off visits might be harsh, but it's understandable given the circumstances. The parents, while being helpful, aren't respecting the household rules, which the author has the right to enforce.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason for their policy and have tried to accommodate. The parents' refusal to comply is the issue here.\n"
