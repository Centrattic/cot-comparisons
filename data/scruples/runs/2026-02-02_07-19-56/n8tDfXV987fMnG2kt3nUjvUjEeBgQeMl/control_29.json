  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule when their mother refuses to take hers off. The situation involves an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth, so cleanliness is important. The parents have housekeepers to clean, and they're grateful for their parents' occasional babysitting help. The mother insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The parents have a valid reason for the no-shoes policy because of the baby's health. They're even paying for regular cleaning, which shows they're proactive. The mother-in-law's refusal is causing a problem, as she's tracking in dirt despite being offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is considering cutting off visitation if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, they're setting boundaries for their home, which they have the right to do. The mother is an adult and her choice to wear shoes is causing issues. The author isn't violating any norms here; they're protecting their family's health. The mother's behavior is the issue, not the author's enforcement of the rule. The author is also providing solutions (slippers, etc.), but the mother refuses. So, the author's stance isn't unreasonable. They're prioritizing their baby's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
