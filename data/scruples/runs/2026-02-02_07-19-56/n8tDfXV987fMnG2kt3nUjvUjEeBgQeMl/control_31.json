He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially because their mother refuses to take her shoes off when visiting. The author has an infant who crawls and puts everything in their mouth, so they have housekeepers to clean the floors monthly. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author has given. The main concern is the baby's health and safety. The house is clean because of regular cleaning, but the mother's shoes are introducing dirt, rocks, grass, and dirt. The author is trying to minimize potential hazards for the baby. That seems like a valid and responsible reason.\n\nNow, the mother's refusal is a problem. The author has asked directly and even offered solutions, but the mother insists. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom a general perspective, as a homeowner, you have the right to set rules for your home for safety and cleanliness. The author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. The mother, while not wanting to take off her shoes, isn't willing to compromise, which is causing conflict. The author's stance is about protecting their child, which is a priority. \n\nHowever, some might argue that being too strict with family could strain relationships. But the author is trying to balance gratitude for the babysitting help with maintaining a safe environment. The mother isn't contributing beyond the visits, so the author's frustration might be justified. \n\nI think the key points are the baby's health, the effort to keep the house clean, and the mother's refusal despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
