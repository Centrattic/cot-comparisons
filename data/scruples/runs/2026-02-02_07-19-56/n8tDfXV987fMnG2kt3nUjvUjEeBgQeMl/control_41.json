  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the AITA (Am I the Asshole) thread is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the context: They have an infant who's crawling and putting things in their mouth. They hire cleaners to maintain the floors, so keeping the house clean is a priority. Their parents come over twice a month for babysitting, which they're grateful for but don't consider an abuse of the system. The issue arises when the mother refuses to take her shoes off, even after being asked and offered solutions like slippers or socks. The author is considering not inviting her over if she continues this behavior.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respecting the homeowner's rules and the health of the baby. The mother is an adult and a guest, so she should respect the host's home rules. The author has made their expectations clear and even offered accommodations. The mother's refusal, despite these, shows a lack of consideration for the host's priorities, especially the baby's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother's discomfort (cold feet) is valid, but the author has already provided alternatives. The mother's refusal without compromise could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's stance is about maintaining a clean environment for their child, which is reasonable. Refusing to comply with such a rule after being asked multiple times might justify the author's decision to stop inviting her over. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host usually has the right to set the rules for their home. The mother's actions are disregarding those rules, so the author isn't being unreasonable. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
