He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because of their infant. The parents-in-law refuse to take their shoes off, even after being asked, and the author is considering not inviting them if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: a crawling baby who puts everything in their mouth. They already have cleaning services to manage the floors. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, which the author is grateful for but doesn't feel they're being taken advantage of. The issue is that the mother insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off visits if the policy isn't followed. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, people often side with parents when it comes to protecting their children's health. The mother's refusal is causing a hygiene problem. The author has offered alternatives like socks or slippers, so they've tried to accommodate. The parents are offered dinner, but that doesn't mitigate the main issue. \n\nSetting boundaries in one's home is generally acceptable. The author is not being unreasonable here. The parents are adults and should respect the home rules. The fact that the author is willing to pay for cleaning suggests they take this seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that their comfort (cold feet) is a valid reason. However, the infant's health is a higher priority for the author. The author is not being inconsiderate if they've made offers to help with the discomfort. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the hosts usually have the right to set their house rules. Since the parents are being asked to follow the rules and are refusing, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing them. The answer is likely B (No)."
