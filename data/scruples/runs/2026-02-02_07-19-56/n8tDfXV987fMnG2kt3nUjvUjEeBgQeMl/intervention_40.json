He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers, and they ask their in-laws to take off their shoes, but the mother refuses despite being offered alternatives. The author is considering cutting off visitation if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main concern is their baby's health and hygiene. Crawling babies are in direct contact with floors, so keeping the environment as clean as possible makes sense. The author has taken steps like hiring cleaners and setting a no-shoes rule, which are reasonable measures for a household with a young child.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is visiting twice a month, which is a specific time. She's refusing to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives. Her reasoning is about cold feet, which might be a personal preference or sensitivity. However, the author is clear that the rule is for their baby's safety. The mother-in-law's refusal leads to dirt and debris being tracked in, which undermines the cleaning efforts.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing their home rules. From a standpoint of hospitality and respect, guests (even family) are expected to follow the host's rules to some extent. Since the mother-in-law is aware of the rule and is choosing not to comply, the author has the right to enforce their policy. The fact that the author is willing to pay for babysitting instead of relying on free help shows they aren't taking advantage of the situation, which might mitigate any perception of being inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, there might be cultural or personal factors. In some cultures, wearing shoes indoors is the norm, and a sudden change could be seen as abrupt. But the author's justification is health-related, which is a valid concern. The mother-in-law's refusal to adapt, even with alternatives provided, suggests she's not willing to make a small compromise for the host's comfort and their grandchild's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for the rule, and after multiple requests and offers to accommodate, the mother-in-law's continued refusal is the main issue. The author is within their rights to set boundaries to protect their home environment.\n"
