He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being asked multiple times. \n\nFirst, the author has a baby who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. That's a valid concern for hygiene. They've hired cleaners and keep shoes outside, so they're clearly trying to maintain a clean environment. The parents come over twice a month to babysit, which the author is grateful for but doesn't feel overused. The issue is the mother not taking off her shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a legitimate reason for the no-shoes rule to protect their baby's health. They've provided alternatives like slippers or socks. The mother's refusal seems stubborn, especially after being asked directly. On the other hand, the mother might feel her comfort is important, but the author's home rules should be respected, especially for a baby's safety.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable. They're setting boundaries for their home. The mother's actions are violating those boundaries, so the author has the right to enforce them. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're protecting their child and maintaining a clean home, which is a reasonable expectation.\n"
