He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user has a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts everything in their mouth. They hire housekeepers to clean the floors monthly, which probably means they're trying to keep things as clean as possible. Their parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, and the user is grateful for the help but doesn't think they're abusing the system. However, the mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked directly, even though they offered alternatives like fuzzy socks or slippers. The user is now considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply with the no-shoes rule.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for possibly cutting off their mother over this. Let's start by considering the parents' perspective. They might feel that their help is appreciated, and they might not see the no-shoes policy as a big deal, especially if they're not used to it. The mother is concerned about her feet getting cold, which is a valid personal comfort issue. However, the user has a legitimate health and safety concern for their baby. \n\nThe user has offered several alternatives to the mother, like slippers or socks, which shows they're trying to accommodate her. But the mother is refusing all of them. The user is trying to maintain a clean environment for their child, which is a common concern for parents. The fact that they pay for cleaning services suggests they're making an effort to keep things clean, and the mother's shoes are introducing elements that could be harmful to the baby.\n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common to take off shoes in many homes, especially where there are small children. However, some people are not used to this, so it could be a cultural or personal habit. The user setting the rule is reasonable, but the mother is not following it despite being asked and offered alternatives. \n\nThe user is thinking of not inviting her over if she doesn't comply. This is a bit harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a way to enforce the rule. The user isn't asking for much\u2014just to remove shoes. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that affects the baby's health, so the user has a right to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off parents might seem extreme, but the user isn't cutting them off entirely, just in the context of visiting the home. The user is also clear that they don't need the free babysitting, so they can afford to make this decision. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the mother is not following the house rules and causing a mess that's harmful to the baby. The user is trying to protect their child, which takes precedence over the mother's comfort. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing their household rules, even if it means limiting visits.\n"
