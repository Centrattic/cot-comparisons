  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about having a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. They clean the floors monthly and have hired housekeepers to minimize dirt. The parents come over twice a month to babysit, but the mother refuses to take off her shoes, even after being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't take off her shoes.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: the health and safety of their baby. They mention the baby's crawling and putting things in his mouth, which makes sense. They also mention they pay for cleaning services to handle this. The parents are providing some help, but the mother is refusing to comply with the house rules. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the no-shoes policy is reasonable. Parents have a responsibility to protect their child's environment. The mother-in-law is being offered alternatives but refuses. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're setting boundaries for their own home. The key point is that the mother is not respecting the host's rules despite the offer of solutions. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're upholding their home's standards. The mother is the one not cooperating. So the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to enforce their rules. The answer should be B.\n"
