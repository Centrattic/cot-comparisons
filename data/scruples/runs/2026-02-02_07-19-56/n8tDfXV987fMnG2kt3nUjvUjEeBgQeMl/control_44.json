He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in a house with an infant. The person has a baby who crawls and puts everything in his mouth, so they have housekeepers to keep the floors clean. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, but the mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's main concern is the health and cleanliness of their home, especially with an infant. They've made an effort to maintain a clean environment, and the mother's refusal to take off her shoes is causing dirt and debris. The author is setting a boundary to protect their baby's health. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is visiting to help, and maybe she's not seeing the issue as the same priority. She's making a stand about her comfort (cold feet), which is a valid concern but perhaps less critical than the health of the baby. The author is willing to offer alternatives like slippers or socks, but the mother isn't accepting them.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, is it unreasonable to have a no-shoes policy? I think it's reasonable, especially in a household with small children. People often have different rules for their homes, and guests are usually expected to follow them. The mother's refusal might be seen as disrespectful to the host's wishes, even if she's family. \n\nThe author is also grateful for the help but is clear about their boundaries. They're not demanding anything else except for taking off shoes, which is a common request. The fact that they're providing alternatives shows they're trying to accommodate, but the mother isn't willing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their home rules. They have a valid reason related to their child's health. The mother, while perhaps feeling her needs are valid, isn't respecting the host's rules. The author's solution of not inviting her over until she complies is a reasonable step to protect their home environment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're maintaining their home's cleanliness for their child's well-being, and the mother isn't respecting that boundary despite being asked. The author's position is justified here.\n"
