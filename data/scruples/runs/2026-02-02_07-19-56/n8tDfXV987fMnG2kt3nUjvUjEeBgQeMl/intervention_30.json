  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes rule in their home with an infant. The parents have this rule to keep the house clean, especially since the baby is crawling and putting things in his mouth. They have housekeepers to maintain cleanliness. The mother-in-law refuses to take off her shoes when visiting, even after being asked and offered alternatives like slippers. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is valid: keeping a clean environment for a baby is a common concern. They've taken steps like hiring cleaners and setting a no-shoes rule. However, the mother-in-law is providing babysitting, which the author is grateful for but doesn't feel they're being taken advantage of. The problem is the MOL's refusal to comply with the rule despite being asked and offered solutions. \n\nThe author's stance seems reasonable because they've set clear house rules for a legitimate reason. The MOL is not respecting those rules, which affects the cleanliness they're paying to maintain. The author is considering cutting off visits as a last resort, which might be harsh, but given the health concerns for the baby, it's understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the MOL might feel that her comfort (cold feet) is important, but the author's rules are about the baby's safety. The author has made compromises by offering alternatives, but the MOL still refuses. In such cases, the host has the right to enforce their house rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They've made reasonable efforts to accommodate the MOL but the rules are necessary. The answer should be B (No).\n"
