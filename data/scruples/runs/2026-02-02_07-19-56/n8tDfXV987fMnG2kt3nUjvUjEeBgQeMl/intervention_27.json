He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes rule in their home, especially with an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers to clean, and their in-laws (the author's parents) come over to babysit but refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked. The author is considering not inviting them if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's primary concern is the health and safety of their baby. Since the baby is crawling and putting everything in his mouth, keeping the house as clean as possible is a valid reason for the no-shoes rule. They also hire professionals to maintain cleanliness, which adds to the effort they're making.\n\nThe parents are coming over twice a month, which is a significant help, but they're not taking off their shoes even after being offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The mother is being firm about it, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is conflicted between being grateful for the help and needing to enforce their home rules.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and etiquette. Typically, guests are expected to respect the host's rules. If the host asks to remove shoes, that's a reasonable request, especially in cultures where it's customary. The parents are being asked directly but are refusing, which could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that they are bringing in dirt despite the cleaning efforts adds to the problem.\n\nHowever, the parents might have their own reasons, like discomfort from cold feet. But the author has offered alternatives (socks, slippers) which the mother refuses. So it's not like the author isn't making accommodations. The parents are not willing to compromise, which could make their stance seem unreasonable.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the visits if the rule isn't followed. That's a tough call because it affects the parents' relationship with their grandchild. But the author's right to set boundaries in their own home is a key factor here. They have a legitimate reason for the rule due to the baby's health. The parents are contributing to a problem that the author is trying to mitigate, which could justify enforcing the rule even if it means losing the babysitting help.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could explore other solutions, like using a rug at the door where they can clean the shoes, or maybe more frequent cleaning when the parents visit. But the post mentions that the author already has monthly cleaning, which might not be enough if the visits introduce significant dirt. The author might feel it's necessary to enforce the rule to protect their baby.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is trying to protect their child and maintain a clean home. The parents are not following a clear rule despite being asked. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The parents are the ones not respecting the home's rules, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
