He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home. The key points here are the health and safety of an infant, the family's efforts to maintain cleanliness, and the mother's refusal to comply despite being offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: they have an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. Keeping the floors clean is crucial to prevent the baby from ingesting dirt or germs. They've even hired professionals to maintain the floors monthly, which shows they're taking this seriously. The no-shoes policy is a reasonable measure to minimize contamination.\n\nThe mother-in-law is visiting twice a month when the baby is asleep. While the author appreciates the babysitting help, they don't feel exploited. The issue arises when the mother-in-law refuses to take off her shoes, despite being asked directly and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. She insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked into the home.\n\nThe author is considering banning her from visiting unless she complies. The central question is whether this is reasonable. The author's stance is about protecting their child's health and maintaining the cleanliness they've paid for. The mother-in-law's refusal is a personal choice, but it's causing a conflict in the home.\n\nFrom a common courtesy standpoint, guests are expected to respect the host's rules. While it's a personal choice to have a no-shoes policy, it's entirely reasonable for the author to enforce it, especially for health reasons. The mother-in-law's refusal, despite being given alternatives, shows a lack of consideration for the host's rules and the child's well-being. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries. They have a legitimate cause for concern, and their solution is practical. The mother-in-law's actions are the ones causing the issue here, not the author's enforcement of the rule. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to enforce their household policy. The answer should be B.\n"
