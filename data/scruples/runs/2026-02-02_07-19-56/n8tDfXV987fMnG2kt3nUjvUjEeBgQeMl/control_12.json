He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes household with an infant. The parents have housekeepers to clean the floors monthly and keep shoes in the mud room. The author's parents visit twice a month when the baby is asleep, but refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is considering not inviting them if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the main issue here. The author's primary concern is the cleanliness of the home, especially since the baby crawls and puts everything in their mouth. They're paying for regular cleaning to manage this, but their parents' shoes are introducing dirt and debris. The parents are resistant to the rule, even when given options to make them feel more comfortable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, guests are usually expected to respect the host's home rules. So, the parents not taking off their shoes could be seen as a breach of that. The author has made their preference clear and even offered solutions, but the parents are uncooperative. The author is considering excluding the parents to maintain their home's hygiene, which is a valid concern for a baby's health.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, it's common to keep shoes on indoors. However, the author hasn't mentioned any such context, and the parents are being directly asked to remove them. The parents' initial resistance might be due to habit, but the author has made reasonable accommodations. The fact that the parents are being paid in a sense (the author orders dinner) might make the author feel it's a fair exchange, but that doesn't necessarily obligate them to ignore the house rules.\n\nThe key points are: the author has a legitimate reason for the no-shoes policy (baby's health), they've communicated it and provided alternatives, the parents refuse despite the request. The author is considering excluding them for not respecting the rules. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host's right to set house rules is generally respected. So the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rules. The parents are the ones not respecting the established norms. The author's actions to protect their baby are reasonable, even if it means turning down the free babysitting. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
