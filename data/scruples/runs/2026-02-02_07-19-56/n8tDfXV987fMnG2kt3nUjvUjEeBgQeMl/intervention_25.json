He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes policy in their house. Their baby is crawling and putting everything in their mouth, so they have housekeepers to clean monthly. They have rules about shoes in the mud room. The parents come over twice a month to babysit, but the mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons are valid. They have a baby who's crawling and ingesting whatever's on the floors. They pay for regular cleaning, so keeping shoes out is part of maintaining a clean environment. The mother's refusal is causing a problem because she's bringing in dirt and debris. The author is clear that they don't need the free babysitting and are willing to pay, so they're not taking advantage. \n\nThe mother is being asked to follow a basic rule, and when asked directly, she's uncooperative. Offering alternatives like slippers doesn't work. The author is setting boundaries for their home, which is reasonable. The key here is that the mother isn't respecting the host's rules, which the author has the right to set. The author is not being unreasonable by asking for shoe removal. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
