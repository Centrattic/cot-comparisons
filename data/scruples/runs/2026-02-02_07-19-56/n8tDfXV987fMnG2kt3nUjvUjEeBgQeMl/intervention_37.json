He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has an infant crawling around, which is a valid concern because babies put everything in their mouths. Keeping the house clean is important for the baby's health. They have professional cleaners, but the mother's shoes are still tracking in dirt, rocks, etc. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes even after being asked. The author is considering cutting off the mother if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I should analyze both sides. On one hand, the author's reasons are about the baby's safety and hygiene. On the other hand, the mother is a family member, and the author is being strict. But the mother's refusal is causing a problem. The author has offered alternatives like slippers or socks, which shows they're trying to be accommodating. However, the mother is not cooperating. \n\nIs the author being too strict? Well, they have a valid reason for the rule. The mother isn't respecting the home's rules, which the author is entitled to set. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable; they just want the shoes off. The fact that the mother is causing repeated mess despite the efforts to clean is a problem. The author is trying to protect their child, which is a strong justification.\n\nBut maybe the author could be more understanding? The mother says her feet get cold. Maybe there's a compromise, but the author has already offered solutions. The mother isn't willing to meet them halfway. So the author's stance is reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
