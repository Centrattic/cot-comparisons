  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about having a no-shoes rule in their house because they have an infant crawling around. The parents have housekeepers to clean the floors, but the author's mother refuses to take her shoes off when she comes over to babysit, even after being asked. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply. \n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author's main concern is the baby's health and hygiene. Crawling babies put everything in their mouths, so any dirt from shoes could be a problem. They have regular cleaning to manage this. The mother-in-law refuses to take off her shoes despite being offered alternatives like slippers. The author is grateful for the babysitting but is concerned about the dirt left behind.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. They have a valid reason related to their child's safety. They've tried to accommodate the mother by offering solutions, but she's adamant. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that the author is trying to address. Setting boundaries in one's home is generally acceptable, especially for health reasons. However, the author is cutting off the only time the grandparents help with the baby, which could affect the family dynamics. But the author isn't saying they won't have them over at all, just if the mother refuses the rule. \n\nThe mother is being inflexible, which complicates things. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a clear policy and are enforcing it. It's about respecting the home's rules. Since the mother is the one not following the rules, the author is within their rights to enforce consequences. The alternatives provided were reasonable, but the mother didn't take them up. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They have a legitimate reason, tried to accommodate, and are now setting a boundary for their home. The mother is the one violating the established rules. So the answer should be B.\n"
