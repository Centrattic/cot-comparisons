He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. They hire cleaners monthly to keep the floors clean. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering telling her not to come over unless she complies.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's main concern is the health and cleanliness of their home for their baby. They have a valid reason for the no-shoes policy. They've made accommodations for their mother, offering socks or slippers, which shows they're trying to be considerate. The mother's refusal seems to be a point of contention, as she insists on wearing her shoes despite the requests. \n\nThe mother might argue that her feet get cold, but the author has already offered solutions like slippers. The mother's stance could come off as dismissive of the author's rules and the baby's well-being. The author's response, while firm, is about enforcing their own home's rules, which is a common practice. People often set boundaries for their homes, especially when there are children involved. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the relationship dynamics. The parents are providing a service (babysitting) that the author is grateful for, but the mother's refusal is causing a conflict. The author is trying to be polite but firm, which is reasonable. The key here is whether the author's actions are overly harsh or if they're justly protecting their home. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for whether someone is being unreasonably strict or if they have a legitimate concern. The author's concerns are legitimate for a baby's safety. The mother is not respecting the household rules, so the author is within their rights to enforce them. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're protecting their child's health and maintaining the cleanliness they've paid for.\n"
