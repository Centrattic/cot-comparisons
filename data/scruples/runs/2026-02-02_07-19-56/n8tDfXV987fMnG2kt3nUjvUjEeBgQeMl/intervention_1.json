He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their house because their infant is crawling and putting things in their mouth. They have housekeepers to clean the floors monthly, and they keep shoes in the mudroom. The parents visit twice a month when the baby is asleep, but they refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is considering not inviting them if they don't comply.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the health of the baby and the family's effort to keep the house clean. Crawling babies do put a lot of stuff in their mouths, so keeping the environment as clean as possible makes sense, especially with the added dirt from shoes. The author has already taken steps by hiring cleaners and designating a place for shoes. The parents are providing free babysitting, which is appreciated, but the refusal to remove shoes is causing a problem. \n\nI think the author has a valid concern. Their home rules are in place for a specific reason\u2014health and safety of the baby. However, maybe they could have communicated the importance more clearly or set boundaries earlier. The parents might not realize how serious the issue is. But the author is directly asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing the parents to come over if they don't follow the no-shoes rule. \n\nOn one hand, it's a health issue, so the author has the right to set rules for their home. On the other hand, maybe the parents feel it's a personal comfort issue. But the author is paying for cleaning to manage the dirt already, and the parents are contributing to the problem by not following the rules. If the parents are offered alternatives and still refuse, that's their choice, but the author should be able to enforce their own home's policies. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for the no-shoes rule, especially with an infant. The parents are being resistant, but the decision is about the baby's well-being. The author is not obligated to allow exceptions that compromise their home's cleanliness. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
