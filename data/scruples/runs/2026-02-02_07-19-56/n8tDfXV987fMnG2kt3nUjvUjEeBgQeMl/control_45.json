  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home with an infant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has a baby who's crawling and putting things in his mouth. They keep the floors clean with monthly cleaning and keep shoes outside. Their parents come over twice a month to babysit, which is appreciated, but the mom refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health and cleanliness of the baby versus the mother's preference for wearing shoes. The author's rules are for their own home, which they have the right to set. The mother is not following the rules, leading to dirt in the house. The author is frustrated because they pay for cleaning and don't want the mess from shoes. \n\nThe author is clear that they don't need the free babysitting and could pay someone else. They're trying to enforce their household rules. The mother is being resistant, which is causing conflict. The author is considering cutting off the visits if the rules aren't followed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's stance is about protecting their baby's health and maintaining a clean home. The mother is not respecting the agreed-upon rules. Since the author owns the home, they have the right to set boundaries. The mother's refusal to comply without valid reasons (other than personal discomfort) might make her the one in the wrong. The author is being reasonable by offering solutions and then standing firm if necessary. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
