He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The situation is about whether the person who keeps a no-shoes policy in their home is in the wrong for potentially refusing to let their parents visit if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: they have an infant who's crawling and putting everything in their mouth. They mention hiring housekeepers to keep the floors clean, so the focus is on hygiene. The parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, and the author is grateful for the help but doesn't want to take advantage. The conflict is that the mother refuses to take her shoes off, despite being offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is considering banning her parents if they don't comply.\n\nNow, the person is asking if they're in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a legitimate health concern for their baby. Infants are vulnerable to germs and dirt, especially when crawling. The author is making an effort to keep the home clean, which is reasonable. The parents are being asked to respect the household rules, which seems fair, especially since they're in someone else's home. The refusal to comply, despite offers of alternatives, might be seen as inconsiderate from the mother's side.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as being too strict. Maybe the mother has a health issue that makes her feet cold, or she's not used to removing shoes. But the author is offering solutions, and the mother is refusing them. The author is also acknowledging that the parents are providing free babysitting, which they're grateful for but don't feel they're taking advantage of. The author is willing to pay for help instead but prefers the parents' help. If the parents are causing a hygiene issue that the author is paying to clean up, then it's a matter of respecting the host's home.\n\nAnother angle: setting boundaries. As a host, the author has the right to set rules for their home, including a no-shoes policy. Guests, including parents, are expected to follow those rules. If a guest repeatedly ignores the rules despite being asked and offered alternatives, it's reasonable to enforce the policy, even if it means limiting visits. The author is not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's health and the cleanliness they've arranged.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for the policy, they've made provisions for the parents' comfort, and the parents are refusing to comply without valid justification. The author is within their rights to ask them to follow the rules or not visit. Therefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
