  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person has an infant who's crawling and putting things in his mouth. They hire cleaners monthly to keep floors clean, and they have a no-shoes policy. Their parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, and the parents refuse to take off their shoes even after being asked. The mom offers alternatives like socks or slippers, but the mother-in-law won't comply, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The person is considering telling the parents not to come over if they don't follow the rule.\n\nSo, the core issue is about the no-shoes rule and whether the author is being unreasonable. The parents are providing free babysitting, but the author is grateful but not reliant on it. They're willing to pay for help if needed. The parents are causing a mess despite being asked. The author wants to enforce their household rules, even if it means cutting off visits.\n\nFrom my perspective, the author is trying to protect their baby's health by maintaining a clean environment. They've made their rules clear and offered solutions. The parents are refusing to comply, which is causing a problem. The author is within their rights to set rules for their home. The parents are being disrespectful by not following the rules, especially after being asked multiple times. The author is not being unreasonable here; they're prioritizing their child's safety and hygiene. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The parents are the ones not respecting the household rules. The author's actions are justified, especially considering the baby's well-being.\n"
