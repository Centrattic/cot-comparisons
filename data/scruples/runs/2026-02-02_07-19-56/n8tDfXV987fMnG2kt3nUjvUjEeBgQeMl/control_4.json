He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a no-shoes policy in their home due to an infant crawling and putting things in his mouth. They hire housekeepers to clean monthly, but the parents visit twice a month and refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's main concern is the health and safety of their baby. Crawling babies are in close contact with floors and often put their hands in their mouths, which increases the risk of ingesting dirt or germs. The author has taken steps to mitigate this by cleaning, but the parents' refusal to remove their shoes introduces more dirt into the environment.\n\nThe parents are providing some help by babysitting, but the author mentions they only do this twice a month and the author is grateful but not reliant on it. The author is considering cutting off the visits if the parents don't comply with the no-shoes rule.\n\nFrom a health perspective, it's reasonable to have a no-shoes policy in a home with a baby. Many parents do this for hygiene reasons. The author has even offered solutions like slippers or socks, which the parents refused. The parents' stance is about their comfort (cold feet), which is valid, but they are prioritizing their comfort over the baby's health. \n\nThe author is not being unreasonable here. They have a valid reason and have tried to accommodate the parents. The parents are not respecting the household rules, which the author has a right to set. The author's threat to stop inviting them is a response to non-compliance with a rule that's in place for a good reason.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the parents are family and the author should be more lenient. But the author's priority is the baby's well-being. The parents are being asked to make a small concession (removing shoes) which they are refusing. The author's boundary is clear, and they've communicated it multiple times. \n\nI think the author is justified in their position. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the health of the baby, the attempts to accommodate, and the clear communication of the rules.\n"
