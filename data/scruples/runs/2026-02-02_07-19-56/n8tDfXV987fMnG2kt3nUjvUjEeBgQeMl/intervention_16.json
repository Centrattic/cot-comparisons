He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a no-shoes policy in their home with an infant. The parents have housekeepers to keep the floors clean, and their parents come over twice a month to babysit. The mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris in the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to keep their home as clean as possible for their baby's health. They've taken steps like hiring cleaners and setting a no-shoes rule. They're grateful for the help but are struggling with their mother not respecting their home rules. The mother is insisting on wearing shoes for comfort and warmth, which the author sees as a hygiene issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's perspective might be that her feet getting cold is a personal comfort issue. She might feel that the request is unreasonable, especially if alternatives like slippers or socks were offered. The author is considering cutting off visits if the rule isn't followed, which is a strong measure but might be justified given the baby's health.\n\nI should think about cultural norms too. In some cultures, wearing shoes indoors is the norm, but in others, it's expected to remove them. The author's rule is their home, so they have the right to set boundaries. However, the parents are providing a service (babysitting) even if it's not often. The author's stance could be seen as strict but necessary for their child's well-being.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they feel the mother's needs aren't being accommodated. But considering the baby's health and the efforts to maintain cleanliness, the author's position seems valid. The mother isn't being forced to take off her shoes; the author is asking her to respect the household rules. If she can't comply, it's reasonable to set boundaries to protect their home and child.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a legitimate reason for their policy and are within their rights to enforce it in their own home.\n"
