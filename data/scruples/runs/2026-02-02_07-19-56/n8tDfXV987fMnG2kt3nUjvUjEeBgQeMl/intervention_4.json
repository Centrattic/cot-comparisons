He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home due to having an infant who crawls around and puts things in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers to clean monthly, but the parents (the author's in-laws?) refuse to take off their shoes when visiting, tracking in dirt and debris. The author is considering not inviting them over if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points here. The author's main concern is the health and cleanliness of their home for the baby. They have a valid reason for the policy\u2014minimizing germs and dirt that the baby could ingest. They've made accommodations for the in-laws, offering slippers and such, but the in-laws refuse. The author is considering cutting off the visits altogether if the policy isn't respected.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it objectively. Let's break it down. The author's home, so they set the rules. The in-laws are guests and should respect the host's rules. If they refuse, the host is within their rights to revoke the invitation. The in-laws aren't willing to compromise despite offers. The author is trying to protect their child's health, which is a valid concern. The in-laws aren't being unreasonable about the policy itself but are refusing to comply despite alternatives being offered. \n\nIs the author being too strict? Well, the baby's health is a top priority. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014it's a common practice in many homes. The in-laws are being uncooperative. The author is not the one being inconsiderate here. The in-laws are the ones not respecting the host's wishes. \n\nSo, based on this, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for the policy and have tried to accommodate the guests. The guests are the ones not respecting the home's rules. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
