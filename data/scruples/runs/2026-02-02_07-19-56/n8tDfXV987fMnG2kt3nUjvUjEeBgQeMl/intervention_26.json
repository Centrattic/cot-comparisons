He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a no-shoes household for a baby's health, but the mother-in-law refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a baby who crawls and puts things in his mouth. They hire cleaners to keep the floors clean, and they have a no-shoes policy. The parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, and the author is grateful but not taking advantage. The mother-in-law now refuses to take her shoes off, even when asked, and there's a mess left behind. The author is considering telling her not to come over if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author has a legitimate reason for a no-shoes policy to protect their baby's health. On the other hand, the mother-in-law is a guest, and maybe her refusal is causing a conflict. But the author is setting boundaries for their own home. \n\nIs it unreasonable to ask guests to remove shoes? In many cultures, it's common to leave shoes outside. The author is providing alternatives like socks or slippers. The mother-in-law's insistence on wearing her shoes might be a personal preference, but the author is prioritizing hygiene. The fact that the author is paying for cleaning to handle this suggests the mess is significant. \n\nThe parents are only contributing twice a month, so maybe the author shouldn't rely on them. But the real issue is the no-shoes rule. The mother-in-law's actions are directly contradicting the author's efforts. The author is considering excluding her, which is a strong move, but perhaps justified given the baby's well-being. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their policy and are trying to accommodate the guest. The mother-in-law's refusal is the main issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
