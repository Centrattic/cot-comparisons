  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because of an infant. The parents have housekeepers to keep things clean, and the author's parents visit twice a month to babysit. The mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is the health and cleanliness for their baby. They have a valid reason for the no-shoes policy. They've tried to accommodate their mother by offering alternatives, but she's refusing. The mother is being stubborn and not respecting the household rules. On the other hand, the parents are providing free babysitting, which the author is grateful for but doesn't feel they're taking advantage. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, they are the ones in charge of their home. Setting rules for cleanliness, especially with a baby, is reasonable. They've made compromises, but the mother isn't budging. The author is considering cutting off the visits, which is a strong move but maybe justified given the circumstances. The mother is the one not respecting the rules, so the author isn't the asshole here. They're trying to protect their baby's health and the cleanliness they pay for. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
