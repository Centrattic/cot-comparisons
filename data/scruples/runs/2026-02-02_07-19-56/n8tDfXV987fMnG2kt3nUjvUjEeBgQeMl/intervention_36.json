He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth, so they have a no-shoes rule to keep the house clean. They hire cleaners monthly to help with this. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, and the author is grateful but has set the no-shoes rule. The mother refuses to take off her shoes, even after being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's the case. Let's break it down. The author's home is their space, and they have a valid reason for the no-shoes rule because of their baby's health. They've made efforts to clean the floors regularly. They've also provided alternatives to their mother, but she refuses. The mother's refusal leads to dirt and debris being tracked in, which defeats the purpose of the cleaning.\n\nFrom a standpoint of personal boundaries and home rules, the author has the right to set those rules. They've communicated it clearly, offered solutions, but the mother is not respecting that. The author is not being unreasonable; they have a health concern for their child. The mother, on the other hand, is not following the agreed-upon rules when visiting, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author is not trying to be uptight but is protecting their home and child. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could perhaps have a conversation about the consequences for the baby's health, or maybe offer a specific area where the mother can leave her shoes. But given that they've already tried offering slippers and the mother is still non-compliant, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nThe key points here are: the author has a legitimate reason, they've communicated the rule, offered alternatives, and the guest is not complying. The author is not being unreasonable. So, in this case, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The mother is the one not respecting the household rules, so the author is justified in enforcing them, even if it means limiting visits.\n"
