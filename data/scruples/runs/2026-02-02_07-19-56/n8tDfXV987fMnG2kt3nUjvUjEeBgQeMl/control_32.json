  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a no-shoes policy in their home due to an infant crawling and eating whatever is on the floor. The parents have house cleaners to keep it clean, but the author's parents refuse to take their shoes off when they visit, leading to dirt and debris being tracked inside. The author is considering cutting off visits if the parents don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's main reason is the health and safety of their baby. Crawling babies put everything in their mouths, so keeping the environment clean is crucial. The no-shoes policy seems reasonable here. The parents are being offered alternatives like slippers or socks but refuse. The author is trying to maintain their home's cleanliness, which they're paying for through cleaners. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are providing a service by babysitting, even if it's not frequent. The author is grateful but also clear about the rules. The parents are not following the rules despite being asked. The author is considering enforcing the rule by not inviting them if they don't comply. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Probably not. They have a valid reason related to their child's health. The parents are not respecting the household rules, which the author has the right to set. While it's courteous to offer alternatives, the parents' refusal is causing a problem. The author's action to enforce the policy by limiting visits is within their rights. They don't owe the parents visits, especially if the parents aren't willing to follow the rules. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're prioritizing their child's safety and maintaining their home's cleanliness. The parents' refusal is the issue here, not the author's enforcement of the rules.\n"
