He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially because their mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked multiple times. The main concern is the baby's health since they're crawling and putting things in their mouth. The parents offer alternatives like slippers or socks, but the mother insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to protect their infant's health, which is a valid concern. Crawling babies are at risk of ingesting harmful substances from dirty floors, so regular cleaning and minimizing dirt are reasonable. The no-shoes policy is a common practice in many homes for hygiene reasons. They even hire cleaners monthly, which shows they're proactive about maintaining cleanliness.\n\nThe mother-in-law is being offered alternatives but refuses. The author has clearly communicated the rule, but the mother is not complying. The author is considering cutting off the visits if the mother doesn't follow the rule. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective.\n\nOn one hand, the mother is being asked to take off her shoes for the baby's safety. On the other hand, the author is providing options, but the mother is resistant. The author's priority is their child's health, which is a strong point. The mother is visiting twice a month, which isn't excessive, but her refusal leads to ongoing issues. The author is not asking for anything unreasonable; it's a standard practice in many places. The fact that the author is willing to pay for babysitting instead of relying on family might suggest they're not taking advantage of the help but just prefer the service.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is within their rights to enforce the rule. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that affects the baby's environment. The author isn't being inconsiderate by setting boundaries for their home. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
