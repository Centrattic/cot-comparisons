  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a no-shoes policy in their house because of their crawling infant. They have hired cleaners to keep the floors clean. The parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, and the author is grateful but also orders dinner for them. However, the mother refuses to take off her shoes, even after being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the main issue is about respecting the host's rules versus the guest's preferences. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes policy: the baby's health and hygiene. They've tried to accommodate the mother by offering solutions, but she's refusing. The mother's stance is about her comfort (cold feet), but that's causing a problem in the host's home.\n\nFrom what I know about social norms, when you visit someone's home, it's customary to respect their rules, especially if they're health-related for a child. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They've made exceptions by offering alternatives, but the guest is still not cooperating. The author is setting a boundary to protect their home and baby, which is reasonable.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to enforce their house rules, especially for a good reason. The mother is being difficult without valid justification beyond personal discomfort.\n"
