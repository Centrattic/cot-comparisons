He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household. The situation involves their infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. The author has housekeepers to clean the floors monthly and keeps shoes in a mudroom. The parents visit twice a month when the baby is asleep and refuse to take off their shoes, leading to dirt being tracked in. The author is considering not inviting them if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main concern is the baby's health, as crawling babies often ingest whatever is on the floor. They have a specific cleaning routine, which is disrupted by the shoes. The parents are providing occasional free babysitting, which the author is grateful for but doesn't rely on. The parents refuse to take off shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is contemplating cutting off visits to enforce the rule.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: They set a house rule for a legitimate reason\u2014keeping the home clean and safe for their infant. They're directly addressing a health concern, which is a valid priority. The parents, while being helpful, are not following this rule. The author is being polite by offering alternatives and even paying for dinner, but the parents are adamant. The question is whether it's reasonable to enforce the rule even if it means losing the babysitting help.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that the rule is too restrictive, especially if they have a valid reason like cold feet. But since the author's home, they have the right to set their own rules. The parents are in a position where they can choose to comply or not. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking them to take off shoes, especially when it's for the baby's well-being. However, the author's threat to exclude the parents if they don't comply could be seen as harsh, but maybe justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's the case. Is the author being overbearing? Or is this a reasonable boundary for their own home? The parents aren't following a simple rule that's in place for health reasons, so the author isn't in the wrong here. They have every right to set such a rule. The parents are the ones not respecting the household's needs, even after being asked multiple times. The author's solution of not inviting them over if they don't comply is a consequence for not respecting the home's rules. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
