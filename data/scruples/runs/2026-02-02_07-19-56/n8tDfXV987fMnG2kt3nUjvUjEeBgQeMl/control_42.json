He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply despite being offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule: an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. They're taking precautions to keep the environment as clean as possible, even hiring professionals to maintain the floors. That makes sense for a parent's concern about their child's health.\n\nThen, the grandparents are coming over twice a month to babysit, which is helpful. The author isn't taking their help for granted and even orders dinner for them. But the mother insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. When asked, she refuses, citing cold feet, even after being offered socks or slippers. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set household rules for their home, especially considering their child's safety, and the mother's refusal to comply despite alternatives. The author is considering cutting off visits to enforce the rule. \n\nMost people would agree that the author isn't being unreasonable in setting boundaries for their home. The mother is an adult and should respect the host's wishes. The alternatives provided (slippers, socks) are reasonable, so the mother's refusal is the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their policy, even if it means ending visits if necessary. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
