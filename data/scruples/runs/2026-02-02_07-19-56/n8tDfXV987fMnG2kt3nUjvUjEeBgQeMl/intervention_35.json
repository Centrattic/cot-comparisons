He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who's crawling and putting things in his mouth. They hire cleaners monthly to keep the floors clean. Their parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit while they have dinner. The problem is the mother refuses to take her shoes off, even when asked, and the author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's side. The main reason for the no-shoes rule is the baby's health. Crawling babies are more exposed to germs and dirt from the floor, which can be harmful. The parents are paying for cleaning services to mitigate this, so it's a deliberate effort to keep the environment safe. The mother's refusal is causing them to track in more dirt, which directly conflicts with their effort to protect the baby.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's side is that she doesn't like taking off her shoes because her feet get cold. She's been offered alternatives like slippers or socks but refuses any of them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing her to come over if she doesn't comply with the house rules.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the fairness of both sides. House rules are typically the host's responsibility to enforce. If the author has established a no-shoes policy for health reasons, guests are expected to comply. The mother is an adult and a guest in the author's home. The author has a right to set boundaries for their own home, especially for a baby's safety. The mother's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, as she's aware of the baby's needs but is prioritizing her own comfort.\n\nThe author is trying to balance gratitude for the babysitting with the need for hygiene. The fact that the parents only offer to babysit twice a month suggests that the author is not overburdening them, but the mother's behavior is causing a problem. The author is considering removing the invitation as a last resort after trying alternatives.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, guests are generally expected to follow the host's house rules unless there's a valid reason. However, in this case, the mother's refusal is causing a health issue for the infant. The author isn't just being picky; they have a legitimate concern. The mother's insistence on wearing her shoes despite alternatives being offered shows a lack of flexibility. The author is not inconsiderate of the mother's feelings (they offered solutions), but the mother is unwilling to compromise.\n\nTherefore, the author is acting in the best interest of their child and maintaining their home's cleanliness. The mother's actions are undermining that, so the author is justified in enforcing their rules. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
