He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who's crawling and putting things in their mouth. They have housekeepers to clean the floors monthly. The parents visit twice a month to babysit, which the author is grateful for. However, the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, even when offered alternatives like slippers. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health and safety of the baby. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes policy to prevent dirt and germs from entering the home, which makes sense when there's a young child who's exploring the environment orally. The mother isn't respecting the home rule, leading to ongoing issues with dirt and debris.\n\nThe author is trying to balance gratitude for the babysitting help with maintaining a clean environment for their child. They\u2019re not asking for anything unreasonable, like removing shoes when the baby isn't crawling, but the mother's refusal is causing a problem. The author is considering cutting off visits if the issue isn't resolved, which seems like a reasonable step when someone's behavior is detrimental to their home environment.\n\nThe mother's stance seems stubborn. She's been offered alternatives but still refuses, making the author's position more justified. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a specific, health-related reason for the rule. The mother's actions are contributing to a problem that the author is actively trying to manage with professional cleaning services.\n\nIn these types of situations, personal boundaries are important. The author is setting a boundary for their home's cleanliness, which is a valid concern, especially with a baby involved. The mother's refusal to comply is the root issue here. The author isn't being uptight; they're prioritizing their child's well-being.\n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for the no-shoes rule, and the mother's refusal is the problem. The author is justified in enforcing their home rules to protect their baby's health.\n"
