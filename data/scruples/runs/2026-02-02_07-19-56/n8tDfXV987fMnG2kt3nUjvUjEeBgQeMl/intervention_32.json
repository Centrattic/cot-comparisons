He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their house when their mother refuses to take them off. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a baby who's crawling and putting things in their mouth. They've hired cleaners to keep the floors clean, and they have a no-shoes policy to minimize dirt and germs. That makes sense for a health reason, especially with an infant. The parents come over twice a month for babysitting, and the author is grateful but only gets free help when they do. The mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked and offered alternatives like slippers or socks. She even says she's willing to fight about it. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health of the baby and the author's right to set house rules. The mother isn't respecting those rules, even when given alternatives. The author is trying to protect their child's health, which is a valid concern. The mother's refusal is causing the author extra work and stress, since they have to clean up after each visit. The author isn't being unreasonable by enforcing their own home's rules, especially for a good reason. The mother is an adult and should be able to comply if she wants to visit. If she can't, then the author is justified in setting boundaries. The author isn't being uptight; they're protecting their family's health. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
