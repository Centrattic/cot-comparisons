  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household when their mother refuses to take off her shoes during visits.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. They hire cleaners to keep the floors clean, so minimizing dirt and germs is important. The parents visiting twice a month for babysitting, but the mother insists on wearing shoes despite being asked. The author offers alternatives like slippers, but the mother refuses. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mother is being disrespectful by not following the home rules, which are in place for the baby's health. On the other hand, maybe the author is being too strict. Wait, but the author set the rules for a good reason. The mother is the one not respecting those boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They've tried to accommodate the mother's discomfort (offering slippers, etc.), but the mother isn't cooperating. So the author is within their rights to enforce the rules or limit visits if the mother can't comply. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
