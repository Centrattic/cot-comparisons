  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially since their mother refuses to comply despite being asked and offered alternatives. The situation involves an infant who is crawling and putting things in his mouth, so the cleanliness of the floors is a concern.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for the policy: protecting their baby's health. They've hired professional cleaners to maintain the floors, which shows they've made an effort to keep the environment safe. The mother-in-law is being offered alternatives like slippers or socks, but she refuses, citing cold feet. The author is considering cutting off the visits if the mother doesn't comply, which is a strong action but perhaps understandable given the circumstances.\n\nNow, considering the other side: the mother might feel that the policy is too strict or that her comfort is being ignored. However, the author clearly communicates their rules and provides alternatives. The mother's refusal seems to be a choice to prioritize her own comfort over the health of the baby. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for homes to have specific rules, especially with young children. The author isn't asking for much beyond what's reasonable. The mother's actions are causing repeated issues (tracking in dirt, etc.), which the author is trying to address. \n\nSo, the author is standing up for their household rules to protect their child's health. They've made reasonable accommodations, but the mother is not cooperating. The author's decision to limit visits might be harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a justified measure to maintain their home environment. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
