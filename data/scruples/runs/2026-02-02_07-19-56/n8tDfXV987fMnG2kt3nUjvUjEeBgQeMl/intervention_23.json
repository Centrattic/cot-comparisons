He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having a no-shoes household to protect their infant from dirt and germs. The parents-in-law refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked, and the author is considering cutting them off if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is understandable. They have a baby who's crawling and putting things in their mouth, so keeping the house clean is a health and safety concern. They even pay for professional cleaning, which shows they take this seriously. The parents are only helping twice a month, so maybe the author feels they're not overusing their help, but they do want the house to be safe.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents-in-law are visiting when the baby is asleep, so maybe they don't see the direct impact. The mother's refusal to take off her shoes could be due to personal discomfort, like cold feet. But the author has offered alternatives like slippers or socks, which the mother-in-law declined. That suggests the issue isn't about not providing solutions but a refusal to comply with the household rules.\n\nNow, the key points: the author is setting boundaries for their home, which they have the right to do. The parents-in-law are guests but are not respecting the rules. The author's main concern is the baby's health, and the parents are not willing to adjust. Is it reasonable to exclude the parents if they don't follow the rules? I think it's a valid choice because the author is prioritizing their baby's well-being. Setting boundaries in one's home is generally acceptable. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for a clean environment. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). The parents-in-law are the ones not respecting the rules, so the author isn't at fault for enforcing them."
