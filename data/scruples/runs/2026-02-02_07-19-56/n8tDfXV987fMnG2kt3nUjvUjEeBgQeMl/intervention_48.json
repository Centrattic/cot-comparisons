He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home when their mother refuses to comply. \n\nFirst, the author has an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. They have a cleaning schedule to keep the floors as clean as possible. Their parents come over twice a month to babysit, and the author is grateful for the help but also doesn't want to abuse the arrangement. The mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, and the author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is about health and cleanliness for their baby. They have housekeepers, so they\u2019re trying to maintain a certain standard. The mother-in-law is being given alternatives like socks or slippers but refuses. The author is considering cutting off the visits if the rule isn't followed. \n\nNow, from a typical AITA perspective, people often consider hospitality and family dynamics. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their child's health, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, refusing family visits might seem harsh. But the key here is that the author is setting boundaries for their home. They don't have to let people in if they don't follow the rules, especially when it's affecting their baby. The mother's refusal is causing a mess that the author is paying to clean up. \n\nI think the author is justified in enforcing their home rules. They\u2019re not being unreasonable by asking to remove shoes when it's about a baby's safety. The mother's refusal is causing a problem, so the author isn't in the wrong for standing their ground. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
