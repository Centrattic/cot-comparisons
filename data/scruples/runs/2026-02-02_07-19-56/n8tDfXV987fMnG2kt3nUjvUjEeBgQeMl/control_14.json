He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having a no-shoes policy in their house because they have an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers to keep the floors clean, but the author's parents refuse to take off their shoes when they visit, even after being asked and offered alternatives like slippers. The author is considering not inviting them over if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the no-shoes rule. The main reason is the baby's health and safety. Since the baby is crawling and putting objects in his mouth, keeping the house as clean as possible makes sense. The author is paying for regular cleaning to handle this, but the parents' shoes are introducing more dirt and debris. That seems like a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the parents' side. They are providing free babysitting twice a month, which the author is grateful for. However, the parents refuse to take off their shoes despite being asked. The mother gives a reason about her feet getting cold, but the author has offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The parents are not willing to comply, which is causing conflict.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the visits if the parents don't respect the house rules. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom one perspective, the author's rules are to protect their baby. They have a right to set boundaries in their home, especially for health reasons. The parents are guests, and guests are expected to respect the host's rules. If they can't, it's reasonable for the author to enforce those rules.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents are trying to help, and the author is being too strict. But the parents have been asked and offered solutions, and they still refuse. The author is trying to balance gratitude with their own needs. \n\nI think the key points here are the baby's well-being and the parents' refusal to accommodate a reasonable request. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They've provided alternatives, but the parents are not willing to comply. So the author is justified in setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
