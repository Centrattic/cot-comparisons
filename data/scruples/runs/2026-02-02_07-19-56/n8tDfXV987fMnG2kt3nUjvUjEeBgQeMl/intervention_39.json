He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially given the situation with their baby.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. The house is cleaned regularly to minimize dirt and germs. The parents are grateful for the babysitting but don't want the additional mess. \n\nThe mother-in-law refuses to take off her shoes despite offers of alternatives like slippers. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, they own their home and can set rules. Their priority is the baby's health and cleanliness. The mother-in-law isn't respecting those rules even after being asked multiple times. The author isn't asking for much\u2014just removing shoes. Offering solutions shows they're trying to accommodate. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the mother-in-law feels her comfort is important, but the author's right to their home rules is stronger here. The key is whether the author is overstepping. Since they're not asking her to do anything harmful, just follow a household rule for a baby's safety, it's reasonable. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
