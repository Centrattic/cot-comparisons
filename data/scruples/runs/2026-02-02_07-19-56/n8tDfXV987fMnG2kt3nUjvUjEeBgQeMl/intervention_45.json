He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author has a no-shoes policy in their home because they have a crawling infant who puts everything in their mouth. They have monthly cleaning to keep things as hygienic as possible. Their parents come over twice a month to babysit while the parents go out, and the author is grateful for the help. However, the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, even offering alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is now considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main concern is the baby's health and safety. Crawling babies are at risk of ingesting dirt, allergens, or pathogens from shoes. The author is doing what they believe is necessary to protect their child. On the other hand, the mother might feel that her comfort is important, especially if her feet get cold. However, the author has made accommodations (slippers, socks) to address that. The mother's refusal seems inflexible and dismissive of the author's rules. \n\nIs the no-shoes rule unreasonable? In many cultures, it's common to remove shoes indoors, especially in homes with children or pets. The author has a valid health reason. The mother's refusal could be seen as disrespectful to the author's household rules. The author is not being ungrateful for the babysitting, but they have a legitimate health concern. The author is willing to pay for cleaning to maintain hygiene, so the presence of dirt from shoes is a problem they're actively trying to solve. \n\nThe mother's stance is causing a conflict. The author is trying to set boundaries for their home, which is their right. The mother's refusal to comply is leading to an ongoing issue. The author's threat to stop inviting her over is a reasonable consequence for not respecting the household rules, especially given the baby's well-being. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground? Perhaps the author could offer more specific slippers or a different solution. However, they've already tried multiple options. The mother's insistence might be causing more harm in terms of the baby's environment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to protect their child, which is a priority. The mother's actions, while perhaps understandable for her comfort, are disregarding the author's health-focused policies. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to enforce their rules, and the mother's refusal is the issue here.\n"
