He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home due to an infant crawling and putting things in his mouth. They hire cleaners monthly and keep shoes in the mudroom. Their parents visit twice a month when the baby's asleep, and the mother refuses to take her shoes off despite being asked, even when offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is considering not inviting the mother over if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's main concern is the health and safety of their baby. Crawling babies do put a lot of things in their mouths, so keeping the house as clean as possible makes sense. The no-shoes policy is a reasonable measure to reduce dirt and germs. They even use professional cleaners, which adds to the effort. The parents are providing free babysitting, which the author appreciates but doesn't feel exploited. The issue is the mother's refusal to comply with the house rule despite being asked directly. She's not willing to compromise, even when given alternatives. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that taking off shoes is uncomfortable, especially if her feet get cold. However, the author has offered solutions (socks, slippers), so the problem isn't that there are no options, but the mother is choosing not to use them. This could be seen as a sign of disrespect for the host's rules. \n\nThe author's possible response is to cut off visits if the mother doesn't comply. Is that fair? The parents are providing a service (babysitting), but the author is considering removing that benefit due to the mother's refusal. The key here is whether the author has the right to enforce their home rules. \n\nIn social etiquette, hosts generally can set their house rules, and guests are expected to comply. If the mother is unwilling to follow that, the author is within their rights to ask her to leave or not invite her. The fact that the mother is being offered alternatives but refuses makes her stance more stubborn. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author seems to be justified in enforcing their rules for their baby's well-being. The mother's actions are the main issue here. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
