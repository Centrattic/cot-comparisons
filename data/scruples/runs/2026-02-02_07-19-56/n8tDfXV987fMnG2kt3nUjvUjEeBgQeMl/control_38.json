  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes household with an infant. The parents have housekeepers to clean the floors monthly, and they want to keep the environment as clean as possible for the baby. The parents' parents visit twice a month for babysitting, but the mother refuses to take off her shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author's rules for the house are to prevent dirt, which is reasonable given the baby's hygiene. The mother-in-law is being asked to take off her shoes, but she refuses despite being offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nI need to think about if the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is understandable because they're trying to protect their baby's health. They've made it clear that there's a rule, and the guest is not following it. The author is also providing solutions (slippers, etc.), but the guest isn't cooperating. The author's response would be to set a boundary, which is within their rights as a host.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother-in-law's refusal could be seen as a lack of consideration. But the author isn't being unreasonable here. They've given alternatives and asked directly. The core issue is the health and safety of the infant, which is a valid concern. The author isn't being uptight without reason; they've already invested in cleaning services. So the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their house rules. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
