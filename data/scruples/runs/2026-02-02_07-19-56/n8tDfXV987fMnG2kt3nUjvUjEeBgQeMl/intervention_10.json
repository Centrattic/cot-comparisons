He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author having a no-shoes policy in their home because of their infant who's crawling and putting everything in their mouth. They hire housekeepers to keep things clean. The author's parents visit twice a month to babysit, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt being tracked in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're doing what's best for their baby's health and hygiene. The parents are providing free babysitting, but the mother is making a big deal about the no-shoes rule. The author is considering cutting off the visits if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that her boundaries or comfort are being disrespected. She's not the one living in the house, so maybe she feels entitled to some personal preferences. However, the author is the one responsible for the environment where their baby is. \n\nHygiene is a valid concern for a crawling baby, especially since they put everything in their mouth. The author has even hired professionals to keep the floors clean. The mother's refusal to take off her shoes, despite being offered alternatives (like slippers), seems to prioritize her own comfort over the hygiene of the home. \n\nThe parents are helping out, but the author is clear they don't feel they're being taken advantage of. The author is being firm about their own home rules, which they have a right to set. The mother's response of \"fighting\" about it and refusing alternatives might be seen as unreasonable. \n\nSo, the author is setting boundaries for their home, which they have every right to do. The mother is not respecting those boundaries, leading to the author needing to enforce them. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a valid health reason. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
