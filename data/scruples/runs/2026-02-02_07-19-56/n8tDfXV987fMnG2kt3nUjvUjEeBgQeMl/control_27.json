He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home, especially because they have a crawling baby. The parents have housekeepers who clean monthly, but the author's mother refuses to take her shoes off when visiting, even after being asked. The mother says her feet get cold and won't comply, leading to dirt and debris in the house.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is the health and cleanliness of their home for their baby. Crawling babies are in close contact with the floor and put everything in their mouths, so keeping the environment as clean as possible makes sense. The no-shoes rule is a common household policy to reduce dirt, which the author is reinforcing through regular cleaning services.\n\nThe mother-in-law is visiting to babysit, which the author is grateful for, but she's not following the house rules. The author has offered alternatives like slippers or socks, but the mother refuses. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply, which is a reasonable boundary to protect their home and child.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's argument is about her comfort (feet getting cold). While that's a personal preference, the author is asking her to respect their home policies. It's a common courtesy to respect a host's rules, especially in a home with a baby. The mother could bring her own slippers, which might solve the cold feet issue without tracking in dirt. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for this, especially since they're paying for cleaning services to maintain the house.\n\nThe key points here are the health of the baby, maintaining cleanliness, and respecting household rules. The mother's refusal is causing a conflict between her comfort and the host's needs. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is their right. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason to enforce their household rules for their child's safety and hygiene.\n"
