He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. They hire cleaners to keep the floors clean, so tracking in dirt and debris would counteract that effort. Their parents visit twice a month when the baby is asleep, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, the author has a legitimate concern. Infants are particularly vulnerable to germs and dirt, so maintaining a clean environment is important. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that the author is trying to manage through cleaning services, which are being undermined by the mother's actions. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries in their own home. They've offered solutions (socks, slippers) and the mother has refused all options. The author's request is reasonable, and the mother is the one not respecting the household rules. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parents are providing a service (babysitting) and the author is being too strict. But since the author mentions they don't need the free help and would pay someone else, it's more about the cleanliness rather than the favor. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, the author has the right to set rules for their home. The mother's behavior is the issue here, not the author's enforcement of the rules. The author is trying to protect their child and maintain the cleanliness they've paid for. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their policy and have made reasonable accommodations, which the mother has ignored. Enforcing the rule to protect their home and child is justified.\n"
