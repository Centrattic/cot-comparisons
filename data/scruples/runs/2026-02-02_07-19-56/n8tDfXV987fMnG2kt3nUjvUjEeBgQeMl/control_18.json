He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a no-shoes rule in their home with an infant. The parents are grateful for their parents' babysitting help but are upset because the mother refuses to take off her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The housekeepers clean monthly, but the author is concerned about the additional mess from the mother's shoes.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for the no-shoes policy: their baby is crawling and putting everything in their mouth. Keeping the home as clean as possible makes sense for a child's health. The author is already investing in professional cleaning, which shows they're taking this seriously.\n\nThe parents are providing a service (babysitting) twice a month, which the author is grateful for. However, the mother is refusing to comply with the home's rules despite being offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author's request is reasonable, and setting boundaries in your own home is normal. If the mother is unwilling to respect those boundaries, the author has the right to decide who enters their home. It's about health and safety, not just being uptight. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
