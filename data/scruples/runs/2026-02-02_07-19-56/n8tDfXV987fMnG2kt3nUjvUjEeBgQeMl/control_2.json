He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household, especially when their mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. They have strict cleaning schedules to keep the environment as clean as possible. The parents are coming over twice a month to babysit, but the mother insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in. The author is considering banning her mother from visiting if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. The author's rules are for the baby's health and safety. They've made accommodations (offering slippers, socks) to make it easier for their mother. The mother, however, is being non-compliant and even confrontational. The author is clear that the visits are a favor, and they're not using the babysitting as an excuse to avoid paying for help\u2014they even mention they could hire someone.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, homeowners typically have the right to set rules for their home. The mother is a guest, and guests are expected to respect the host's rules. If the mother refuses, then the host is within their rights to revoke the invitation. The author is trying to balance gratitude with their need for a clean environment. The mother's behavior is causing a problem that affects the baby's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the mother is being unreasonable, but the author has tried multiple times to accommodate. The mother's refusal without valid reason (other than personal preference) is the main issue here. The author's stance seems justified because they've made clear the rules and the reasons behind them, and the mother isn't respecting that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason for the no-shoes policy, especially for a baby's health, and they've given their mother alternatives. The mother's refusal to comply after being asked directly is the problem here.\n"
