  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes rule in their home to protect their infant. The parents have hired cleaners monthly, and their parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep. The mother-in-law refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris being tracked in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has valid reasons for the no-shoes policy because of their baby's health and hygiene. The mother-in-law is given alternatives like slippers or socks but refuses. The author is considering cutting off visits if the mother-in-law doesn't comply.\n\nI should think about the balance between the author's needs and the mother-in-law's preferences. The author is trying to maintain a clean environment for their child, which is a legitimate concern. The mother-in-law's refusal is causing a conflict. The author isn't being unreasonable by enforcing their own home rules. The fact that they offer alternatives but the mother-in-law still refuses suggests that the mother-in-law is at fault here. \n\nAlso, the author is grateful for the babysitting but isn't obligated to accept it if it's against their home rules. The key point is that the author's rules are in place for a critical reason (a baby's health), and they are willing to pay for help instead of relying on family. The mother-in-law's insistence on wearing shoes seems inconsiderate in this context. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
