He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. They hire cleaners monthly and have a no-shoes rule to keep the house clean. The parents visit twice a month to babysit, but the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked, offering alternatives like slippers. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author's health and safety concerns for their baby, the effort they've made to keep the house clean (hiring cleaners), the fact that the parents are only helping twice a month, and the mother's refusal to comply with the household rule. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is being unreasonable by enforcing their own home rules. The mother is an adult and should respect the host's wishes. Especially since the author is providing alternatives (socks, slippers), the mother's refusal seems inconsiderate. The author isn't being ungrateful for the babysitting, but they are setting boundaries for hygiene. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the mother's refusal is due to personal preference or discomfort, but the author's priority is their baby's health. Also, the author isn't asking for anything extreme\u2014just removing shoes. The alternatives offered suggest they're trying to accommodate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, enforcing home rules is generally acceptable, especially when health is a factor. The mother is not being forced to wear anything; she just needs to remove her own shoes. The author is within their rights to ask guests to follow their rules. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
