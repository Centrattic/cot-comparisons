  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author has a no-shoes policy in their house because their infant crawls and puts things in their mouth. They hire cleaners monthly to keep the place clean. The parents come over twice a month when the baby is asleep to babysit, which the author is grateful for. However, the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author is considering not inviting her if she doesn't comply.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's main concern is the health and safety of their baby. They have a valid reason for the no-shoes rule. The mother-in-law is being offered alternatives but still insists on wearing shoes, leading to dirt and debris. The author is trying to balance gratitude for the babysitting with the need for a clean environment. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I see, the author isn't being unreasonable. They've provided solutions, but the mother-in-law is uncooperative. The author's priority is their child's well-being, and they're willing to stop the visits if necessary. It seems like the mother-in-law is the one not respecting the household rules here. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their home and baby's health.\n"
