He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth. The parents have housekeepers, and they're grateful for their in-laws' help with babysitting. The issue is that the mother-in-law refuses to take off her shoes, leading to dirt and debris in the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main concern is their baby's health and safety. They have a no-shoes policy for a valid reason, especially since the baby is in a stage where he's exploring everything orally. The in-laws are providing some babysitting, but the author isn't relying on them and is willing to pay for help instead. The mother-in-law is refusing to comply with the no-shoes rule despite being asked and offered alternatives like slippers. The author is considering cutting off visits if the shoes aren't removed.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, they have a specific rule for a health-related reason. It's their home, and they have the right to set boundaries. The mother-in-law is not respecting the household rules, which is causing a problem. The author has tried to accommodate the mother-in-law by offering alternatives, but she's still non-compliant. The author's response to not invite her over if the shoes aren't taken off seems reasonable because they've already tried other solutions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being too strict or that the mother-in-law's discomfort is valid. But given the context of a crawling baby, the health risk from dirt and germs is significant. The author is also paying for cleaning services to maintain the home, so the mother-in-law's actions are undermining that effort. The author isn't being ungrateful for the babysitting; they're just trying to protect their child. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their policy and have made efforts to accommodate the mother-in-law. The mother-in-law's refusal to comply is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
