He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because of their infant. The parents are visiting twice a month when the baby is asleep, and the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has valid reasons: a crawling baby who puts everything in their mouth, so cleanliness is a priority. They hire cleaners regularly and have a no-shoes rule to minimize dirt. The parents are providing some help, but only twice a month. The mother is being difficult, refusing to comply even when offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author feels it's gross and is considering cutting off visits unless the mother complies.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel her comfort is important, especially if her feet get cold. But she's being asked to respect the home's rules. The author is setting boundaries for their own home, which is their right. The mother's refusal could be seen as selfish or disrespectful, especially when alternatives are provided. The author isn't asking for much, just compliance with a household rule that's in place for a good reason.\n\nThe author's intention is to protect their baby's health and maintain cleanliness. The parents are getting something (babysitting) for free, but the mother is not respecting the rules. The author is willing to pay someone else if needed, so they don't feel obligated to accept the help if it's at the expense of their home's cleanliness. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions are unreasonable. Here, the author is enforcing a household rule that's necessary for their child's well-being. The mother is being asked to follow a common courtesy, and her refusal is causing a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their baby's health. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
