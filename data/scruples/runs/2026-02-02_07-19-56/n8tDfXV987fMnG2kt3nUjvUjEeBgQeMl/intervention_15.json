He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because of an infant crawling and eating whatever is on the floor. The parents are grateful for their parents' babysitting help but the mother keeps refusing to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author is considering not inviting her anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes rule to protect their baby's health. They've made efforts to be accommodating by offering alternatives like slippers. The mother's refusal seems to be causing a problem, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is frustrated and considering not allowing her to visit if the rule isn't respected.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to maintain a clean environment for their child, which is a legitimate concern. They've already taken steps to make it easier for the mother to comply. The fact that the mother is being stubborn and not respecting the household rules could justify the author's stance. \n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. The author is relying on their parents for some babysitting, and cutting them off might affect the support they receive. However, the author has clarified that they don't need the free help and could pay someone else, which might reduce the pressure to accommodate the mother's request.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some cultures, removing shoes is the norm, and in others, it's not. The author might be from a culture where this is standard, and the mother is coming from a different cultural background. But the story doesn't mention cultural differences, so maybe that's not a factor here.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing their own household rules. Since the author is the one hosting and their health/safety concern is for their child, it's reasonable to expect guests to follow the rules. The mother's refusal to comply, despite alternatives being offered, could make the author right in their decision to stop allowing her to visit if she can't respect the rules.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. Their primary concern is the health of their infant, and they've made reasonable accommodations. The mother's stubbornness is leading to a conflict, and the author has the right to set boundaries for their home. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
