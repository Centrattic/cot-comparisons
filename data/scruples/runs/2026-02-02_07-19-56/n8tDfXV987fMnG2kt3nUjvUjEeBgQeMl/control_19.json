He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a no-shoes policy in their home because they have a crawling infant. They have hired cleaners to keep things clean, and they ask their parents to take off their shoes when they visit. The parents, specifically the mother, refuse to take off her shoes despite being asked, leading to dirt and debris in the house. The author is considering not inviting the mother over anymore if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a baby who is putting everything in their mouth, so keeping the house clean is important for the baby's health. The no-shoes policy is a reasonable measure to prevent dirt, which makes sense. They even offer alternatives like slippers or socks, which shows they are trying to accommodate the mother's discomfort. The mother's refusal is causing a problem that the author is trying to mitigate by setting boundaries.\n\nNow, the parents do help out by babysitting twice a month, which is appreciated, but the author doesn't feel they're being taken advantage of. The main issue is the mother's insistence on wearing shoes, which conflicts with the household rules. The author is considering not inviting her over if she doesn't comply. Is this too harsh?\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's argument is that her feet get cold. However, the author has already offered solutions (slippers, etc.) to address that. The mother's refusal despite these offers might make the author's stance more justified. The author is also willing to pay for other babysitting, so they don't rely on the parents for help, which means they could choose not to let the parents in if necessary.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's rules are unreasonable. Since the reason is a baby's health and they've made efforts to accommodate, it's hard to say they're wrong. The mother's behavior is the issue here. The author is standing up for their household rules, which is their right. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
