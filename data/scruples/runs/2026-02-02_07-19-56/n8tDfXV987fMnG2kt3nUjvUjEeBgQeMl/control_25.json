He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes policy in their home, especially when their mother refuses to take her shoes off during visits. The main issue here is the health and cleanliness of the house with an infant who's crawling and putting everything in their mouth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a baby who's at a stage where they're in contact with the floor and ingesting whatever they touch. The parents are taking precautions by hiring cleaners and enforcing a no-shoes rule to minimize germs and dirt. The mother's refusal is causing a problem because she's tracking in debris, which goes against the efforts the parents are making. The author is thinking of cutting off their mother if she doesn't comply, which is a strong action but might be justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's side is that she dislikes taking off her shoes, citing cold feet. She's been offered alternatives like slippers or socks but refuses them. The author provided solutions, but the mother is adamant. The question is whether the author's stance is too strict. In many cultures, removing shoes is common, but it's not universal. However, in a situation where health is a primary concern, especially for a vulnerable infant, the parents have a valid reason to enforce the rule. \n\nThe key points here are the baby's health, the parents' efforts to maintain a clean environment, and the mother's refusal to comply despite being asked and offered alternatives. The author is trying to balance gratitude for the babysitting with maintaining their home's cleanliness. The mother's actions are undermining the parents' efforts, so the author's decision to enforce the rule or stop the visits if necessary seems reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
