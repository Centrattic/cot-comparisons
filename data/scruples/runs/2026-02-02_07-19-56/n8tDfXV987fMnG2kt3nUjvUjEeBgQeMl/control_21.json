He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes policy in their home, especially since their mother refuses to take off her shoes when visiting. The main issue here is about the health concerns for their infant and the cleanliness of the house.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid concern. Babies crawl and put things in their mouths, so any dirt or germs from shoes could be a health risk. They even mention having professional cleaners to maintain the floors. That shows they're taking this seriously.\n\nThen, the parents come over twice a month for babysitting, which the author is grateful for but doesn't consider an abuse of the system. The mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked and offered alternatives like socks or slippers. She insists on wearing her shoes, leading to mess that the author has to clean up afterward. \n\nThe author is considering refusing the mother's visits if she doesn't comply. The question is whether this makes the author in the wrong. \n\nFrom a standpoint of personal boundaries and health, especially with a small child, the author has the right to set rules in their home. The mother isn't respecting those rules, which are in place for a specific reason. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're trying to protect their child's health. \n\nThe mother's argument about cold feet is a personal preference, but it's not a valid reason to disregard the host's rules, especially when alternatives (like slippers) are provided. The author is willing to offer solutions, but the mother isn't accepting them. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their home's rules. They have a legitimate health concern and are trying to maintain a clean environment. The mother is the one not respecting the household's policies. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
