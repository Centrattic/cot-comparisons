  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a no-shoes policy at home because their infant is crawling and putting everything in their mouth. They hire cleaners monthly to keep the floors clean. The parents visit twice a month to babysit, which is helpful, but the mother refuses to take her shoes off even when asked. The author is considering telling her mother not to come over if she doesn't comply. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for this.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the health and safety of the baby versus the mother's discomfort. The author's main concern is keeping the environment as clean as possible for the baby, which is understandable. The mother is not following the household rules despite being offered alternatives like slippers or socks. The author is willing to stop the visits if the mother doesn't comply.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate reason related to their baby's health. The mother, while being provided with solutions, is refusing to adapt. The author should have the right to set boundaries in their own home, especially for a good reason. The mother might need to adjust if she wants to visit. So, the answer is B.\n"
