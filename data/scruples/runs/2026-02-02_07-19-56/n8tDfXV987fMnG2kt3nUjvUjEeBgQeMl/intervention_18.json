He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author has a no-shoes policy in their home because they have an infant who crawls and puts everything in his mouth. They hire housekeepers monthly to keep the floors clean. Their parents come over twice a month to babysit when the baby is asleep. The parents refuse to take their shoes off, even when asked, and the author is considering telling them not to come over if they don't comply. The author is asking if they're at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is about the health and safety of their baby. They have a valid concern because crawling babies do put things in their mouths, and dirt from shoes can be a hazard. The no-shoes rule is in place to minimize that risk, and they even have professional cleaning to help. So the author's stance is about protecting their child.\n\nThe parents, on the other hand, are offered alternatives like socks or slippers but refuse. They mention that their feet get cold, but they've been given options. The author is considering excluding them if they don't follow the rule. The parents are providing a service by babysitting, which the author is grateful for, but the author is more concerned about the cleanliness.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key points here are the author's right to set house rules and the parents' refusal to comply. The author is clear about the rules, and the parents are being disrespectful by not following them. The author is not being unreasonable; they have a specific reason related to their child's health. The parents could have brought their own slippers, which was offered, but they didn't. So the author's response of potentially excluding them might be justified because they are not respecting the household's rules. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents feel they are being treated disrespectfully, but the author has a valid reason. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they are enforcing their own home rules for a good reason. The parents are not being forced to take off their shoes if they can find a compromise, but they refuse. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
