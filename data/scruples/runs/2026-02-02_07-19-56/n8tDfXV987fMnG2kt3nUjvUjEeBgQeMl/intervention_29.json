He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes policy because of their infant. The parents are visiting twice a month for babysitting, which the author is grateful for but doesn't consider an abuse of the system. The issue is the mother refusing to take her shoes off despite being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: an infant crawling and putting things in their mouth makes cleanliness important. They pay for regular cleaning, which is a valid point. The parents are getting free babysitting, so maybe they should respect the household rules. But the mother is adamant about not taking her shoes off, even after being offered solutions like slippers or socks. She's prioritizing her comfort over the author's health concerns.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the mother if she doesn't comply. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's actions introduce dirt and potential health risks. On the other hand, the author is using the babysitting as leverage, which might be seen as unfair since the service is provided for free. However, the author has a right to set rules in their own home. The alternatives were offered, and the mother refused. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a valid health concern for their baby. So, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n"
