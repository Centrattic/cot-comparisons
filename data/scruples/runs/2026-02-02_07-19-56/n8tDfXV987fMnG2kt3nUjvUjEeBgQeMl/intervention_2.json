He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home, especially when their mother refuses to comply even after being asked and offered alternatives.\n\nFirst, the author has an infant who crawls and puts things in their mouth. So the main concern is keeping the environment as clean as possible. They hire housekeepers monthly, which shows they're already investing in cleanliness. The parents come over twice a month to babysit, which the author is grateful for, but the mother refuses to take off her shoes despite being asked. The author offers alternatives like slippers or socks, but the mother still insists on wearing her shoes, leading to dirt being tracked in. The author is considering not inviting the mother over if she doesn't comply.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that accurate? Let's break it down. The author has a valid reason for the no-shoes policy\u2014health and safety of their baby. They've tried reasonable solutions (offering slippers) and the mother still refuses. The author is also clear that they can pay for babysitting if needed, so they're not depending on free help. The mother is being asked to follow a household rule that's in place for a specific reason. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have found another way, but the mother is being stubborn. The author's home, so they have the right to set rules. The mother is an adult and can choose to respect that or not. If she doesn't, the author is within their rights to say she's not welcome. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
