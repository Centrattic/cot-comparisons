He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for keeping a no-shoes household. The person has an infant who crawls and puts everything in their mouth, so they have strict cleaning and no-shoes rules. Their parents refuse to take off their shoes, even when offered alternatives, and the person is considering not inviting them over if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is their baby's health and the cleanliness of the home. They've hired professionals to keep the floors clean, which shows they take this seriously. The parents are only coming over twice a month for babysitting, which is a significant help. However, they're not following the no-shoes rule, leading to dirt and debris entering the home. The author is frustrated because they've offered alternatives but the parents refuse.\n\nOn the other side, the parents might feel that their comfort and preferences are being ignored. Wearing shoes indoors is common in many cultures, so the author's request might seem strict. The parents might also feel that their help is being undervalued, especially if they're only called upon for babysitting. The author's threat to stop inviting them could be seen as cutting off family support over a disagreement.\n\nThe key points are the baby's safety and the author's right to set household rules versus the parents' right to their own comfort and the value of family relationships. The author has made reasonable accommodations (offering slippers), but the parents are not complying. The author is considering excluding them, which could strain family ties. However, the author's actions are to protect their child's health, which is a valid concern. In AITA scenarios, the person is often not in the wrong when protecting their family's well-being, especially a child's. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
