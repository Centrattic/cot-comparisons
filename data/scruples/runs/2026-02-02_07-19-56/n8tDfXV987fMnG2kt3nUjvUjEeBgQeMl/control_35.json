He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes rule in their home because their mother refuses to take off her shoes, leading to dirt and mess that their housekeepers have to clean up. The situation involves an infant who crawls and puts things in his mouth, so the cleanliness is a concern.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a valid concern for their baby's health and hygiene. The no-shoes policy is likely to reduce the amount of dirt, germs, and other contaminants that could be harmful to the baby. They even mention hiring professionals to clean the floors regularly, which shows they're proactive about maintaining cleanliness.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is resistant. She's offered alternatives like slippers or socks but refuses, and she's even willing to argue about it. The author is considering cutting off visits unless she complies. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a standpoint of home rules, the author has the right to set boundaries in their own home. They're not being unreasonable by having a no-shoes policy, especially given the infant's age and crawling. The mother's refusal to comply, despite being asked politely and given options, suggests that the issue isn't about the policy itself but her personal preference and discomfort.\n\nThe author is also trying to balance gratitude for the free babysitting with their need for a clean environment. They're not taking advantage of the babysitting; they even order dinner for their parents. The problem arises when the parents don't respect the household rules that are in place for a good reason.\n\nIn similar situations, people often set rules for the well-being of their family, especially young children. The key here is that the author is not being unreasonable in their policy, and the mother's refusal is the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rules, and it's reasonable to expect guests to comply with basic hygiene practices in someone else's home, especially when it's for health reasons.\n"
