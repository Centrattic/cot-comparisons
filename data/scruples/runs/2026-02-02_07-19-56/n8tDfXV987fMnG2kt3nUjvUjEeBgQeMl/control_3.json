He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for enforcing a no-shoes policy in their home, especially regarding their parents not taking off their shoes when visiting. The main points here are the health concerns for the infant and the effort to keep the house clean with professional help.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: their baby is crawling and putting things in their mouth. Keeping the floors as clean as possible is a reasonable precaution. They've even hired housekeepers to maintain this, which shows they're taking active steps. The parents are offered alternatives like slippers or socks but refuse, which complicates things because the author's efforts are undermined each time.\n\nNow, the parents are coming over twice a month for a specific purpose\u2014babysitting. The author is grateful but sets boundaries. When asked to remove shoes, the mother refuses despite being offered solutions. The author's frustration is understandable since the dirt and debris from shoes contradict their efforts. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is overstepping by not allowing the visits if the rule isn't followed. The author isn't denying the parents' help but is setting a condition for their presence. The parents are free to decline the visits if they don't agree, but the author has the right to set house rules, especially when it's for health reasons. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're prioritizing their child's health and maintaining a clean environment, which is a valid concern. The parents' refusal to comply after multiple offers of alternatives doesn't give the author the blame here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
