  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for keeping a no-shoes household?\nI have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. \n\nMy parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I\u2019m really grateful for the free help, I don\u2019t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. \n\nMy mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn\u2019t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds \u201cno. My feet get cold. I\u2019d rather fight with you about it.\u201d And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn\u2019t take off her shoes? I don\u2019t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can\u2019t respect the rules of my home, she\u2019s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it\u2019s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThey have a no-shoes policy because their infant is crawling and putting things in their mouth. They hire housekeepers monthly to keep the floors clean. Their parents come over twice a month to babysit while they go out. The mom refuses to take her shoes off, even when asked. The author is considering not inviting her parents if they don't comply with the rules.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is the baby's health. Crawling on dirty floors could expose the baby to germs, dirt, etc. They've already taken steps by hiring cleaners and keeping shoes outside. The parents are getting free babysitting, but the author isn't using it often. The problem is the mom's refusal to take off shoes despite being offered alternatives like socks or slippers. The author is considering cutting off visits if the rule isn't followed.\n\nIs the author being reasonable? Well, they are in charge of their home's rules. It's their responsibility to protect their baby. The mom is being stubborn and not respecting the household's needs. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014just to take off shoes, which is common in many households. Offering alternatives shows they are trying to accommodate. The mom's refusal seems inconsiderate. The author isn't being uptight; they have a valid health concern. The threat to stop inviting them might be harsh, but it's a consequence of their own rules. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. The mother is the one not respecting the household rules. So the answer should be B.\n"
