I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend bringing her friend to the author's apartment and causing issues. The author wants to tell the girlfriend to stop bringing the friend over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend was staying at the author's place temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary, which seems reasonable. Then the girlfriend started bringing her friend, which the author is now uncomfortable with. \n\nThe key points are the friend's behavior and the girlfriend's change in behavior when the friend is present. The author describes instances where the friend was rude, like making a sarcastic comment about the author having an opinion. Also, the girlfriend became more hostile, dismissing the author's request to use another room for the game. \n\nThe author is considering setting a boundary by asking the girlfriend to stop bringing the friend. Is that justified? The girlfriend is with her friend, but the author's space and comfort are being affected. The friend's behavior seems toxic, and the girlfriend's change in demeanor is a red flag. \n\nThe author isn't asking for anything unreasonable. They're living in their own apartment and have the right to expect that their partner respects their space and doesn't bring in someone who creates conflict. The girlfriend's friend is contributing to an uncomfortable environment, so setting that boundary isn't unfair. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. They gave examples of the friend's negative impact. It's reasonable to ask the girlfriend to stop bringing someone who causes issues. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why her friend behaves that way and whether it's affecting their relationship. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking steps to protect their own mental health and living environment, which is justifiable.\n"
