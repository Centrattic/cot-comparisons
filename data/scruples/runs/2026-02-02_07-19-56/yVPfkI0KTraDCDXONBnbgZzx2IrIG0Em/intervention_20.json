I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend moved in temporarily after a family conflict. The author was clear it was temporary. The issue arises when the girlfriend brings her friend, and both the friend and girlfriend act disrespectfully and catty towards the author. Specific incidents include laughing at him, a friend cutting him off rudely, and both complaining about him after being asked to leave the living room.\n\nThe author's main concern is that his girlfriend changes her behavior when this friend is around. He feels disrespected and wants to stop the friend from coming over. The question is whether he's in the wrong for setting this boundary.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, setting boundaries is crucial. If someone is making the living environment uncomfortable, it's reasonable to address it. The author has communicated clearly that the stay was temporary. The girlfriend's friend's behavior seems to be a problem, and the girlfriend is also acting differently. The author isn't trying to control who his girlfriend befriends but wants to maintain his own comfort and peace in his home.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the author should communicate his feelings to his girlfriend first rather than just banning the friend. But the scenario shows multiple negative interactions, so it's understandable he wants to take action to prevent further issues. The key points are mutual respect in a relationship and the right to set personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the friend from coming over if her presence causes conflict and disrespect. So the answer is B, No.\n"
