I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend moved in temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author allowed this as a temporary arrangement. Then the girlfriend starts bringing her friend, and things start to get tense. The author gives examples of awkward interactions and the friend being rude. The friend and girlfriend act differently around him, and the author feels uncomfortable.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is justified in asking the girlfriend to stop bringing her friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He's in his own apartment, so he has the right to control who's there. The friend's behavior is rude, and the girlfriend's behavior changes when the friend is around. The author is frustrated and wants to set boundaries. It's reasonable for him to feel that he shouldn't have to tolerate the friend's negativity or the girlfriend's attitude when the friend is present. The author is also considering pushing the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents, which might be part of the solution.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She's in a difficult situation with her parents, and the friend might be a source of support for her. Bringing the friend over might not be malicious; maybe it's a way for her to cope. However, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. The girlfriend might not realize how her friend is acting around the author. The issue could be that the girlfriend is under stress, and the friend is amplifying that stress.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to his living space and the girlfriend's responsibility to manage her friend's behavior. The author has set boundaries from the start (temporary stay), and the friend's presence is causing conflict. The author is within his rights to ask the girlfriend to respect his space and stop bringing someone who is causing issues. The girl's friend's behavior is unkind, and the girlfriend's attitude is affected by her. The author has a right to expect that guests don't make him uncomfortable. However, he should communicate this clearly and with empathy, not just unilaterally decide without discussing with his girlfriend. But the main question is if he's in the wrong for wanting to set these boundaries. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend's remarks were clearly disrespectful. The author's examples show that the friend is unkind, and the girlfriend isn't standing up for him. So the author's decision might be necessary for his own comfort and mental well-being. The fact that the girlfriend is changing her behavior around the friend is a red flag. The author is not being unreasonable in this case. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
