I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author's girlfriend initially came to stay with him because of a fight with her parents. He made it clear this was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend, who he had met before. The author feels that his girlfriend acts differently around this friend, becoming catty and nasty. There are specific incidents mentioned where the friend was dismissive or rude, and the girlfriend acted with an attitude. The author is considering banning the friend from his apartment.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the girlfriend's behavior changing around her friend, the friend's rude comments, and the author's desire to set boundaries.\n\nThe author has a right to feel uncomfortable. The friend's behavior includes cutting him off with a sarcastic remark about him needing to have an opinion, which could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's friend and she both seem to mock him when he comes home, and the friend even complained about the game the author was playing. These instances could justify the author feeling that his space and feelings are being disrespected.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior is a factor. She came to stay temporarily, and now she's bringing someone else into their shared space. The author might have expected a certain level of respect and consideration from both his girlfriend and her friend. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might be influenced by her own stress from the fight with her parents, which could affect her interactions.\n\nIs the author overstepping by banning the friend? Well, since the girlfriend is staying in the author's apartment, which he provided as a temporary arrangement, the author has a right to set boundaries regarding who is in his home. The friend's presence seems to be causing consistent discomfort and conflict. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to protect his living space and mental well-being.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend might not have discussed this with him. Maybe she thought bringing a friend was acceptable. However, the author had communicated that the stay was temporary, which could imply that additional guests aren't part of the original agreement. The friend's behavior is also a separate issue. The author has the right to ask for a respectful environment in his home.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's behavior change around her friend. If she's acting differently, maybe there's an issue with the friendship itself. The author might be reacting to the toxicity in their dynamic. It's possible the girlfriend is unaware of how her behavior is changing, so the author's intervention could be about protecting their relationship.\n\nBut does the author have the right to exclude the girlfriend's friend without discussing it with her first? The author could talk to his girlfriend about how the friend's presence affects him, but he's already observed multiple incidents. The question is whether his desire to set a boundary is justified given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He has valid reasons based on disrespectful behavior from the friend and a change in his girlfriend's behavior. Setting boundaries in one's home is reasonable, especially when it's affecting his comfort and the temporary arrangement. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
