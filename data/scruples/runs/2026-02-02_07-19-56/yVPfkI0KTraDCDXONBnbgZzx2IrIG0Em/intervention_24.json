I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend stayed with the author temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary. Then the girlfriend started bringing her friend, and the author has had several negative experiences with them. The key points are the behavior of the friend and how the girlfriend acts around her.\n\nThe author mentions specific incidents: laughter when he enters, an offensive comment from the friend, and an argument about game time. The girlfriend seems to change her demeanor when the friend is present. The author wants to stop the friend from coming over and push the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author made it clear the stay was temporary. The girlfriend bringing a friend might complicate that setup. The author's living space is personal, and having someone else in it could be an issue. The friend's behavior seems hostile, which adds to the problem. The girlfriend's change in behavior is concerning because it affects their relationship dynamics.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's setting boundaries for his own space and comfort. If the friend's presence is causing tension and hostility, it's reasonable for him to want that to stop. However, maybe he should address the issue with the girlfriend first instead of just cutting off the friend. But the question is about being in the wrong. The friend's actions and the girlfriend's change in behavior are on their end. The author is protecting his space, so he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
