I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend came to live with him after a fight with her parents. He made it clear it was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend over. The author notices that his girlfriend acts differently when her friend is around\u2014nasty and catty. There were specific incidents: when he came home, they laughed at him, and when he offered to make snacks, the friend rudely shut him down. The last straw was when he asked them to move to the bedroom, and they both complained about him even with the TV on. Now he wants to tell her not to bring the friend anymore and push her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: he's a guest in his own apartment. He's stressed because his girlfriend's friend is making the environment unpleasant. He's not against the friend entirely, since he's met her before and found her okay. But the friend and his girlfriend together create tension. He's had specific instances where he felt mocked and disrespected. His intention is to set boundaries to protect his living space and maybe encourage the reconciliation between the girlfriend and her parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side: she might feel that her friend is a source of support during a difficult time. Maybe she's trying to cope with family issues and the friend is a comfort. The friend's behavior could be unintentional or a reaction to the girlfriend's stress. The girlfriend might perceive the author's request as controlling or not supportive.\n\nBut the key points here are about respecting boundaries. The author's apartment is his personal space, and he has the right to set rules about who can be there. The girlfriend's friend has been disrespectful, and the girlfriend's behavior changes significantly when the friend is present. The author has tried to handle it by moving to another room but is now at a breaking point.\n\nThe author isn't forbidding his girlfriend from seeing her friend altogether; he's just asking her not to bring the friend to his apartment. That seems reasonable, especially after the negative experiences. Also, pushing her to reconcile with her parents might be necessary if the temporary stay is becoming a long-term issue without resolution.\n\nBut is there a chance the author is being too controlling? Maybe if he hadn't communicated his discomfort earlier, but in the post, he mentions specific incidents where the friend was rude. The friend's remarks, like \"shocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it,\" are clearly condescending. The girlfriend's defensiveness might indicate she's becoming more sensitive or influenced by her friend's negativity.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is planning to talk to his girlfriend, which is the right approach. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the friend's presence is causing persistent conflict and disrespect in his home, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. He's not restricting her social life entirely; just the location. Unless he's being unreasonable without valid cause, but the examples given do support his concerns.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his space from disrespectful behavior and addressing the issue after trying to accommodate. The girlfriend's friend's actions are contributing to the problem, and the author has a right to ask for a change.\n"
