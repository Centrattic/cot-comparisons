I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. The situation is that the girlfriend came to stay with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. She started bringing her friend over, and the author is uncomfortable with how both his girlfriend and the friend act around each other. There are specific instances where the friend was rude, and the girlfriend became catty. The author feels like he's being laughed at and disrespected, especially in the last incident where he was told to move to his bedroom and the friend and girlfriend complained about him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend was supposed to stay temporarily until things with her parents were resolved. But she's been staying longer, and the friend's presence is causing tension. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend and her friend behave differently around each other, making him uncomfortable. The friend has been hostile, as seen in the sandwich incident. The author wants to set boundaries by not allowing the friend to come over anymore.\n\nIs it wrong for him to set such a boundary? Well, in a relationship, both partners should feel respected and comfortable in their shared space. If a third party is causing consistent discomfort, it's reasonable for the author to address it. However, the way he's handling it might matter. He's considering cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with his girlfriend first. Maybe he should first talk to his girlfriend about the issue, express his feelings, and see if they can find a solution together. If he just tells her outright without communication, that could be abrupt and potentially hurt her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior seems intentionally disrespectful. The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. The problem might be the friend's influence on his girlfriend, making her act differently. The author's desire to protect his living space and mental well-being is understandable. However, it's important to approach the situation with empathy. The girlfriend might feel that her friend is important to her, and cutting her off without understanding the underlying reasons could affect their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: The author allowed the girlfriend to stay temporarily, but she's been there longer. Perhaps he should also address the fact that she hasn't resolved things with her parents yet, which was the original condition. Combining that with the friend issue might be necessary. But the main question is about the friend's presence. The author isn't wrong in wanting to maintain a peaceful environment. He has the right to set boundaries in his home. However, the approach matters. Instead of just forbidding the friend, communication is key. If he's been patient and tried to talk about it, then his actions are justified. If he's been passive-aggressive or ignored his feelings, maybe he's wrong. But from the given scenario, he's tried to be civil, and the friend's behavior has been overtly rude. So, he's not in the wrong for wanting to stop the friend from coming over. The answer is B (No).\n"
