I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend came to stay with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. He was clear it was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend, and he's noticed a change in her behavior. There are specific incidents where the friend and girlfriend have been rude or dismissive towards him, making him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the author is considering setting a boundary by not allowing the friend in his apartment. The question is whether he's justified in doing that. \n\nI should consider a few things. First, the girlfriend is staying in his apartment, which is her partner's space. Bringing someone else into that space can affect the dynamics. The author has a right to feel uncomfortable if the friend's presence is causing conflict or making him feel disrespected. \n\nThe girlfriend's change in behavior around her friend is significant. If she's acting differently and being catty, that could indicate the friend has a negative influence. The author's right to set boundaries in his own home is important. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have addressed the issue with his girlfriend first before deciding to ban the friend. Communicating his discomfort might be a better approach. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to set that boundary, not whether he should have done it differently. \n\nThe key points are: his own space, the negative behavior from the friend and girlfriend, and his right to feel comfortable. So, the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's protecting his space and well-being. The girlfriend should be respectful of his feelings, and if the friend is contributing to a hostile environment, it's reasonable to set that boundary.\n"
