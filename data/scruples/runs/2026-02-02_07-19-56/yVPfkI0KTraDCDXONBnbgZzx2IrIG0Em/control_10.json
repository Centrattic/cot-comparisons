I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend bringing a friend over to their apartment, leading to several uncomfortable incidents. The author wants to tell the girlfriend that the friend can't come over anymore and also push her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The girlfriend initially came to stay with the author temporarily after a fight with her parents.\n2. The author was clear this was temporary.\n3. The girlfriend started bringing her friend, who is described as making the author uncomfortable.\n4. There are specific incidents where the author felt disrespected or mocked by the friend and girlfriend.\n5. The author wants to stop the friend from coming over and encourage the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's main issue is the change in the girlfriend's behavior when her friend is around. The friend's comments and the girlfriend's attitude are causing tension. The author feels that their own behavior isn't the issue, but the presence of the friend is triggering negativity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is setting boundaries for their own space. They were upfront about the temporary stay and now want to enforce rules in their apartment. The friend's behavior seems disrespectful, and the girlfriend's change in demeanor is problematic. The author isn't being confrontational without reason; they have specific grievances. The girlfriend hasn't addressed these issues, so the author's desire to set boundaries is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might need to communicate this in a respectful way to the girlfriend, explaining their feelings without being accusatory. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to set that boundary. Since the author provided examples of negative interactions and the girlfriend isn't addressing the problem, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to feel uncomfortable in their own space and take steps to protect it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
