I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore. The situation involves the girlfriend's friend causing tension and acting disrespectfully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend came to stay temporarily after a family conflict. The author clearly stated this was temporary, but she started bringing her friend over. The friend and girlfriend's behavior has been problematic. Instances include laughing at the author's expense, making snide comments, and arguing over space. The author feels like his girlfriend is a different, more negative person around her friend.\n\nThe author wants to stop the girlfriend from bringing her friend over and push her to reconcile with her parents. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's opinion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is within his rights to set boundaries in his own apartment. If the friend's presence is causing stress and the girlfriend isn't respecting his space or comfort, he has a right to ask her to stop. The examples given show clear disrespect and a change in the girlfriend's behavior, which could indicate the friend has a negative influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should communicate this to his girlfriend respectfully, not just assume. He might need to address the issue with her first to understand her perspective. However, the friend's behavior seems to be the main problem here, and the girlfriend's actions (changing behavior) are part of the issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries to maintain his own well-being. The temporary stay was agreed upon, and the friend's presence is complicating things beyond the initial arrangement. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to enforce that boundary. Answer B.\n"
