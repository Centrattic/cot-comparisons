I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering telling his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially came to stay temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author made it clear that this was temporary. Then the girlfriend started bringing her friend, who the author had met before and thought was okay. But when the friend is around, the girlfriend acts differently\u2014nasty and catty. There are specific incidents mentioned: one where they laughed at him when he came home, another where the friend rudely dismissed his offer to make snacks, and a recent one where the friend and girlfriend complained about him after he asked them to move to the bedroom for his game time.\n\nThe author feels that his girlfriend is a different person around her friend. He wants to stop the friend from coming over and maybe push her to reconcile with her parents. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nHmm. From what I see, the author is setting boundaries. He was clear about the temporary stay and the friend's presence is causing conflict. The friend's behavior seems hostile, and the girlfriend becomes unkind around her. The author is reacting to these issues by wanting to enforce boundaries. \n\nPossible angles: Is it wrong for the author to expect respect in his own home? If the girlfriend and her friend are being disrespectful and creating a hostile environment, he has the right to address it. On the other hand, maybe he should have communicated his discomfort earlier or tried to resolve it with the girlfriend first. But the examples given show clear disrespect towards him, and the girlfriend's change in behavior is significant. The author isn't just being controlling; he's responding to actual negative behavior. \n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's usual personality vs. when the friend is around, there's a pattern. The author might be justified in wanting to remove a source of stress. Unless there's something missing, like the author being overly sensitive or the friend's behavior being misunderstood, but the incidents seem specific and repeated. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his living space from negative influences. He's not banning the friend without cause; the actions of both the girlfriend and friend are contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
