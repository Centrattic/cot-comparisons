I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the WIBTA post) is in the wrong when they want to tell their girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. The situation is that the girlfriend's friend is causing tension, making both her and the friend act differently around him. The author has given several examples where interactions with the friend have been negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend came to stay temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary. Now, the friend's presence seems to exacerbate the situation, making the girlfriend act out of character. The examples given\u2014like the friend being sarcastic, the friend and girlfriend laughing at his expense, getting dismissive when he wants to socialize\u2014suggest that the friend's presence is causing conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to set this boundary. In relationships, communication is key. The author has tried to accommodate the girlfriend but the situation is affecting his comfort and peace. The friend's behavior seems hostile, and the girlfriend's behavior changes negatively when she's around. The author is trying to protect his own space and mental well-being, which is understandable.\n\nBut why might someone think the author is in the wrong? Maybe because he's not giving the girlfriend a chance to address the issue with her friend first, or maybe because he's being too controlling. However, given the examples, it seems like there's a valid reason for the boundary. The friend's presence is causing consistent negative interactions, and the author is seeking to prevent further issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be overreacting. Maybe the girlfriend's friend isn't the problem, or the girlfriend isn't aware of her friend's behavior. But the author has already documented several incidents where the friend acted disrespectfully. It's reasonable for the author to feel that the friend's presence is toxic and to set boundaries to protect himself.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author is not in the wrong. He's addressing a legitimate issue that affects his living environment. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
