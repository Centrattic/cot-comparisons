I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The question is whether telling the girlfriend she can't bring her friend over is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is upset because his girlfriend started bringing her friend over after staying with him following a fight with her parents. The friend's presence seems to make the girlfriend act differently, more catty and rude. There are specific incidents mentioned, like laughing at his expense, a friend's sarcastic comment, and an argument over using the living room. The boyfriend wants to stop the friend from coming over and encourage the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend initially set a temporary arrangement for the girlfriend to stay with him, but then the friend's presence added tension. The boyfriend is now considering setting a boundary by restricting the friend's visits.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend has a right to his space and comfort. If the friend's presence is causing him stress and the girlfriend is acting differently, it's reasonable for him to address this. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being restricted, especially if she's bringing friends over as part of her social life. The boyfriend should have discussed this openly with her before taking a stance, ensuring mutual understanding.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they think the boyfriend should handle it more diplomatically. However, the boyfriend's right to set boundaries in his own home is valid. The main issue is whether he communicated his concerns first. Since the scenario mentions he's considering telling her, maybe he hasn't done so yet, but the intention is to set a boundary. If he approaches it respectfully, it's about protecting his own well-being, which isn't wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's addressing his discomfort and setting boundaries in his apartment, which is his right. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's friend's behavior and the girlfriend's change in behavior, not the boyfriend's decision to address it.\n"
