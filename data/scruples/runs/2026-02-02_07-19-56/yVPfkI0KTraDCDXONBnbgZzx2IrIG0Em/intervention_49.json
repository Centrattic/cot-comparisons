I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy and his girlfriend are in a situation where she's staying with him due to a fight with her parents. He allowed her to stay temporarily, which was fine until her friend started coming over. The problem arises when her friend is around, making the guy uncomfortable. There are specific instances where the friend and girlfriend acted disrespectfully\u2014laughing at him, cutting him off with a sarcastic comment, and arguing about his game time. The guy now wants to set a boundary.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's the one who initially set the condition that her stay was temporary. Now, the friend's presence is causing tension. The key here is whether the guy has a right to set boundaries in his own apartment. Since it's his home, he can decide who comes and goes. The girlfriend's behavior changes when her friend is around, which is creating a hostile environment for him. The guy is reacting to ongoing negative interactions that affect his comfort and living space.\n\nHe hasn't acted yet, just considering it. But if he communicates his feelings calmly and sets boundaries, that's reasonable. The girlfriend might need to be aware of how her actions are affecting him. The problem isn't the guy being in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, but rather if he's being unfair. The examples he gives support his decision. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
