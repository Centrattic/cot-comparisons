I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend came to stay with the author temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary. Then, the girlfriend started bringing her friend over, and the author is uncomfortable because around this friend, both the girlfriend and the friend become mean and catty. There are specific incidents mentioned where the friend was rude, and the girlfriend's behavior changed. The author wants to stop this and maybe get the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's in his own apartment, set boundaries about temporary stay, and is now dealing with someone else (the friend) who makes him uncomfortable. The friend's behavior is actively making him feel disrespected and the girlfriend's behavior is changing. He has a right to feel safe and comfortable in his home. The situations described could be seen as harassment or creating a hostile environment. The author's request to not have the friend over is about maintaining his personal space and respecting his boundaries.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might feel that her friend is a support system during a tough time. The friend's behavior might be defensive or a reaction to stress. The girlfriend might not realize how the friend is affecting the situation. However, even if that's the case, the friend's actions are causing harm to the author. The girlfriend's changing behavior when the friend is around is a red flag, suggesting possible codependency or negative influence.\n\nThe key here is the author's right to his space. People have the right to set boundaries in their homes. If the girlfriend is staying with him, she should respect his living conditions. The friend's presence is causing conflict and discomfort. The author's intention is to protect his environment, which is valid. However, the approach matters. He should communicate this respectfully and understand if the girlfriend is attached to the friend. But the core issue is about his right to his space, so he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's parents situation is temporary, so maybe the author is within his rights to request that the friend not be a part of that temporary stay. The friend's negative behavior is exacerbating the situation, and the author is justified in wanting to prevent further conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his personal boundaries in his home. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
