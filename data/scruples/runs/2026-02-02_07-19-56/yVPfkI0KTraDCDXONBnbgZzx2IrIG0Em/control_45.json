I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong when considering telling his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend stayed with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. He was okay with that, but then she started bringing her friend over. The author mentions that his girlfriend acts differently when her friend is around, becoming nasty and catty. There are specific examples where the friend was rude to him, making jokes at his expense and being dismissive. The last incident involved the friend complaining about the author's presence and both of them talking negatively about him, even when he's in his own apartment. He wants to stop the friend from coming over and maybe encourage the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to set this boundary. From a relationship perspective, boundaries are important. If the girlfriend's friend is causing conflict or making the author uncomfortable, it's reasonable for him to express that. He's the host of the apartment, so he should have the right to set rules about who comes in. However, I need to consider if there's any fault on his part. Did he communicate his discomfort early on? The user didn't mention him confronting the friend before the last incident, but he did have prior experiences. He might have given them chances to change behavior, but if they didn't and he's been harmed, then he has a right to protect his space.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior change is a key point. Maybe she's influenced by the friend in a negative way, which could affect their relationship. The author wants to prevent further issues. The friend seems to be disrespectful and possibly malicious. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to stop the friend from coming over. \n\nBut is there a chance the author overreacted? The examples given do show the friend's hostility and the girlfriend's change in demeanor. The author is seeking to maintain a peaceful environment in his home. The answer is likely B, No, he's not in the wrong. He's justified in setting boundaries to protect his personal space and well-being.\n"
