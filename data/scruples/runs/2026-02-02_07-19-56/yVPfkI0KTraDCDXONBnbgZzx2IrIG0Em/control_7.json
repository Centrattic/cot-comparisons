I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong when considering telling their girlfriend not to bring her friend anymore. The scenario involves the girlfriend staying with them after a fight with her parents, and the friend's presence causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend started staying with them temporarily. Then she started bringing her friend over, which the author finds problematic. There are several incidents where the friend's behavior is disrespectful, and the girlfriend becomes catty. The author is fed up and wants to tell her friend not to come anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to set that boundary. Let's break it down. The author provided a temporary living arrangement, which was agreed upon. The girlfriend's friend's behavior is disruptive and disrespectful. The author is within their rights to set boundaries in their own home. The girlfriend's change in behavior when the friend is around suggests that maybe the friend's presence is causing her to act differently, which the author isn't comfortable with.\n\nThe author isn't saying the girlfriend is wrong, but that the friend's presence is causing issues. It's about the author's comfort and the living environment. Since the original arrangement was temporary until she made up with her parents, maybe the author feels the stay is extended beyond that, but the main issue is the friend. The author's right to control who is in their apartment is a factor here. Unless there's an agreement that allows the girlfriend to bring friends without consent, the author can set boundaries. The friend's disrespectful comments and the resulting tension justify the author's decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the friend from coming over. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
