I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend to his apartment anymore because the friend's presence causes conflict and makes him uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has a right to his living space and should feel comfortable there. He's been accommodating by letting his girlfriend stay with him temporarily. However, the girlfriend's friend is causing tension. The key points are the friend's behavior and how the girlfriend acts around her. The friend has been dismissive, rude, and even mocking the author, which is problematic. The girlfriend also becomes uncooperative and changes her demeanor when the friend is present.\n\nOn the other hand, the author hasn't addressed the issue directly with his girlfriend. He's been experiencing these issues for a month, but hasn't communicated his concerns clearly. Instead, he's considering an ultimatum. That could be seen as abrupt. A better approach might have been to first talk to his girlfriend about how the friend's behavior is affecting him and ask if there's a way to resolve the situation amicably. By not addressing it directly first, he might be cutting off a potential solution where the friend's behavior changes or the girlfriend sets boundaries.\n\nBut the author has the right to his own space and to feel respected there. If the friend is being disrespectful, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. However, the method of communication matters. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to tell his girlfriend to stop bringing the friend without discussing it first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be right to feel that the environment is toxic when the friend is present. But by not discussing it with his girlfriend first, he might be making an assumption that she's unaware or doesn't care. The girlfriend might need to be informed of the specific incidents to understand the issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether he should have communicated his feelings first. Since he hasn't mentioned talking to her about the friend's behavior, he might miss an opportunity to resolve the issue without cutting off the friend entirely. However, his desire to protect his living space is valid. The line between personal boundaries and relationship dynamics is tricky here. Since the friend's actions are hostile, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but his approach could be improved by first discussing with his girlfriend before making a decision. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is likely B (No), because the author has the right to his space and the friend's behavior is unacceptable. However, the approach could be better. But the question is about being in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
