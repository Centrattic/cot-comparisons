I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to tell their girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore because the friend and the girlfriend act differently and cause issues.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend initially stayed at the author's apartment temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary. Then the girlfriend started bringing her friend, and the dynamics are problematic. The friend and girlfriend become catty, there's an instance where the friend made a sarcastic comment, and another where they complained about the author playing a game. The author feels uncomfortable and wants to stop this.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author's apartment is their space. People generally have the right to set boundaries about who is in their home. The girlfriend was supposed to stay temporarily, but maybe that's extended beyond what was agreed. The friend's behavior is disrespectful, which adds to the issue. The author is not wrong for wanting to protect their living space from being disrupted by someone who's clearly creating tension. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should communicate first before banning the friend. The problem might be a miscommunication. However, the author has already had multiple incidents where the friend was rude. The author's main concern is their own discomfort and wanting to maintain a peaceful environment. Since they've tried to accommodate the girlfriend's friend (like offering to make snacks) and still face issues, the author is justified in setting a boundary. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior changes when her friend is around. Maybe the girlfriend needs to address her friend's behavior. But the author isn't responsible for that; they're just concerned about their own space. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to ask their girlfriend not to bring someone who is causing problems into their home. The answer should be B.\n"
