I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to bring her friend to his apartment anymore. Let's start by looking at the situation he described.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was staying with the author temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author made it clear that this was temporary. Then the girlfriend started bringing her friend over. The author mentions that his girlfriend and her friend act differently around each other\u2014being \"nasty\" and \"catty.\" There are specific examples: laughing at the author's expense, an insult when he offered to make snacks, and a conflict about using the living room.\n\nThe author is fed up and wants to tell his girlfriend the friend can't come anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might have different views.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, boundaries are important. The author provided the apartment as a temporary place for his girlfriend, and the presence of her friend is causing tension. The girlfriend's behavior changes when her friend is around, which is a red flag. The author might feel his living space is being invaded, and the friend's comments and actions are disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the author should consider communication. Maybe he hasn't discussed his feelings with his girlfriend yet? The situation might require talking to her first before making a decision. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for deciding to set the boundary. \n\nThe friend's behavior seems hostile. The author has the right to his space and shouldn't tolerate disrespect. The girlfriend's change in behavior might indicate the friend has a negative influence. The author's decision to stop the friend from coming over is about protecting his own environment and well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting boundaries to maintain his peace of mind and the health of his relationship. Answer B.\n"
