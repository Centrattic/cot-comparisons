I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is living with his girlfriend, who initially came to stay because of a fight with her parents. He agreed to host her temporarily. Now, she's bringing her friend over, and things are getting tense.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend acts completely different around her friend\u2014becoming \"catty\" and nasty. There are specific incidents: the friend laughs at him, makes a sarcastic comment about him offering snacks, and both the girlfriend and the friend seem to mock him. The last straw was when the friend and girlfriend complained about him playing a game in the living room, and he could hear them bitching about him.\n\nThe author wants to tell the girlfriend her friend can't come over anymore and maybe push her to reconcile with her parents. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author set boundaries initially by saying the stay was temporary. The girlfriend brought a friend without prior discussion, which might have crossed those boundaries. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic, making the author uncomfortable. The author is reacting to being disrespected and trying to reclaim his space. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend didn't consult the author before bringing her friend. The key here is communication. Did the author already set clear boundaries about guests? If so, and the girlfriend ignored them, then maybe the girlfriend is at fault. On the other hand, if the author didn't communicate his discomfort about the friend's presence earlier, he might be overreacting now.\n\nThe author mentions the girlfriend is usually sweet but changes around her friend. That suggests that the friend might be the toxic influence. The author's actions are about protecting his living space and mental well-being. Since the girlfriend's friend is causing tension and disrespect, the author is within his rights to ask the girlfriend to stop bringing her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to address a situation where his space and peace are being invaded. The girlfriend and her friend are violating the initial agreement and making him uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is justified in setting this boundary.\n"
