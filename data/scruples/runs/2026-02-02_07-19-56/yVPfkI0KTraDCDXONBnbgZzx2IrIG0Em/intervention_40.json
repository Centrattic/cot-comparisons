I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend bringing her friend to the author's apartment, and he's becoming uncomfortable with their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author set up the situation where his girlfriend was staying with him temporarily until her parents made up. He was clear it was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend, and he's noticed a change in her behavior, becoming catty and rude. There are specific examples where the friend was dismissive or hostile towards him, like the sandwich offer and the game incident. The friend's comments about the man having an opinion, and the girlfriend's attitude when he wanted to stay in the living room. The author feels that the presence of the friend is making his girlfriend act differently and he wants to stop this by telling her not to bring her friend anymore.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me think. The author is a guest in his own apartment, right? He's the one providing the space. If his girlfriend is staying with him, and she brings someone else, there might be an expectation of privacy and respect. The friend's behavior towards him seems disrespectful. The author has a right to feel uncomfortable in his own home. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend isn't aware of how her friend is behaving. The author could have communicated his discomfort earlier. However, he's given multiple examples where the friend's behavior was clearly negative. He tried to be polite, like when he offered to make snacks and was shut down. The situation escalated, and the author wants to set a boundary. Setting boundaries in one's own home is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the issue with the girlfriend before cutting off the friend entirely. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for deciding to tell her not to bring the friend. Since the friend's presence is causing tension and the girlfriend is acting differently, the author is justified in wanting to protect his living environment. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He has the right to set boundaries in his home, especially when the friend's presence is affecting his well-being.\n"
