I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore. The situation is that the girlfriend initially came to stay with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. Then she started bringing her friend, and the author is uncomfortable with their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's friend has been acting nasty and catty, making the author feel targeted. There are specific examples of awkwardness and condescension from the friend, which the author finds hurtful. The girlfriend changes her behavior around this friend, which is a red flag because it suggests she's not being authentic in front of him. \n\nThe author is setting boundaries by wanting to stop the friend from coming over. Is that reasonable? Well, when someone lives in a shared space, they have the right to set boundaries about who comes into their home. The friend's behavior seems to be causing distress, so the author has valid reasons to be upset. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to talk to his girlfriend when the friend made a snide comment, but the friend dismissed his offer. The girlfriend's attitude in the last incident where she prioritized her friend's needs over his time off might indicate a lack of support for his feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend's behavior is problematic, but is the author overreacting? He's not the one being rude; he's trying to protect his space and mental well-being. The friend's comments and the girlfriend's change in behavior suggest that the dynamic is unhealthy. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues that affect comfort and respect. The author isn't banning the friend out of jealousy or without cause; he's responding to consistent negative interactions. So, setting boundaries by asking her not to bring the friend over is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
