I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend initially came to stay with the author because of a fight with her parents, and it was supposed to be temporary. The author was clear about that. Now, she's bringing her friend, and there are several instances where the friend and girlfriend behave in a way that makes the author uncomfortable.\n\nThe author mentions specific incidents: one where they laughed at his expense when he came home tired, another where the friend rudely dismissed his offer to make snacks, and a recent one where they complained about him after he refused to move rooms. The author is frustrated because his girlfriend acts differently around her friend, and he's had enough.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author is living in his own apartment, and if his girlfriend is staying there, bringing friends might be part of her social life. However, the author did set boundaries initially\u2014temporary stay. Now, bringing a friend into the mix without considering his space could be an issue.\n\nThe friend's behavior seems to be a problem. The author is the one who feels disrespected by the friend's comments. The girlfriend's attitude change when the friend is around is significant. So, the author's request to not have the friend over might be about maintaining his own comfort and space. \n\nBut is he in the wrong for setting that boundary? If the girlfriend is in his apartment, he has the right to set rules about who can be there. The problem is whether the girlfriend respecting his space by not bringing friends, especially since it's a small apartment. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel she needs her friend's support, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, the author has been clear about the temporary nature of her stay. If the friend's presence is causing tension and conflict, the author has a valid reason to ask her not to come. The key here is mutual respect for each other's space and boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his environment and mental well-being, especially since the girlfriend's behavior changes negatively when her friend is present. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's setting boundaries in his own space, especially when there's a history of conflict and disrespect from the friend. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
