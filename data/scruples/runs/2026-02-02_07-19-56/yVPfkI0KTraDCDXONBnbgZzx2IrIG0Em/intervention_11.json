I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to tell their girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore because the friend and the girlfriend act badly around him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend was staying with the author temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author made it clear that the stay was temporary. The girlfriend started bringing her friend, which the author is now uncomfortable with. There are specific incidents mentioned where the friend and girlfriend were catty, laughed at him, and the friend insulted him.\n\nThe author wants to stop the girlfriend from bringing her friend over and maybe push her to reconcile with her parents. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. So the question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to set this boundary.\n\nHmm. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author is trying to protect their space and comfort. The girlfriend's friend's behavior is clearly making the author uncomfortable, and the girlfriend's change in demeanor around the friend is a red flag. The author has the right to set boundaries in their own home, especially if other people are being disrespectful or causing tension.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier or tried to talk to the girlfriend first before cutting off the friend. But given the incidents described, the author's frustration is valid. The girlfriend's friend's comments, like \"shocker the MAN has to have an opinion,\" are dismissive and rude. The author is justified in not wanting to tolerate that behavior in their home.\n\nThe girlfriend's change in behavior is also concerning. It's possible that the friend is influencing her negatively, which might be affecting their relationship. The author is within their rights to set a boundary to maintain a healthy living environment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
