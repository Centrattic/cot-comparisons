I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The author wants to tell their girlfriend she can't bring her friend to the apartment anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend came to stay temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary. Then, the girlfriend started bringing her friend over. The author has had several negative experiences with the friend and the girlfriend's attitude when she's around.\n\nThe author mentions specific incidents where the friend and girlfriend were dismissive or rude. For example, laughing at the author's expense, the friend making a snide comment about him having an opinion, and both complaining about him after he asked them to move. The author feels that his girlfriend becomes a different, nastier person when the friend is around. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So I need to consider both sides. The author is in a shared living space and has the right to set boundaries. The girlfriend's friend is causing tension and conflict in the apartment, which is the author's home. The author has tried to communicate but the situation is escalating. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her friend is a support system, especially since she's staying with the author due to family issues. The author could be overreacting if the friend isn't doing anything objectively wrong, but from the author's perspective, the behavior is hurtful and disruptive. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to set boundaries in their own home, the girlfriend's change in behavior when the friend is present, and the specific incidents that show a pattern of disrespect. The author is not being unreasonable by wanting to address this. It's about maintaining a comfortable living environment. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (answer B). They have valid reasons to set this boundary, especially after repeated issues that affect their living space and well-being.\n"
