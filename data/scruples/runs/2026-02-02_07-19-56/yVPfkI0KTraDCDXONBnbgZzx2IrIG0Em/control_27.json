I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's wrong for him to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nSo, the background: His girlfriend stayed with him after a fight with her parents. The arrangement was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend over, and he's noticed a big change in her behavior when the friend is around. There are specific incidents where the friend was rude to him, and his girlfriend acted differently, being more catty and dismissive. The last straw was when they complained about him playing a game and then talked about him behind his back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his perspective. He's living in his own apartment, and he's sharing it with his girlfriend, who was supposed to stay temporarily. Now she's bringing someone else into the space, and it's causing conflict. The friend's behavior is disrespectful, and the girlfriend's behavior changes. He's clearly uncomfortable and wants to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend feels like her friend is a support system, and she needs that. But the problem is that when the friend is there, the dynamic becomes toxic. The author is trying to protect his living space and his well-being. \n\nIs he being unreasonable by asking her to stop? Well, he's the one living there. If a guest is being rude and causing issues, he has the right to set boundaries. The girlfriend might need to understand that her friend's presence is affecting the relationship negatively. \n\nBut wait, is the author overreacting? Maybe the girlfriend's friend is just being herself, and the author is taking things personally. However, the examples he gave\u2014like the friend cutting him off with a nasty comment and the two of them bitching about him\u2014seem valid reasons for feeling disrespected. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend acts differently when her friend is around suggests that maybe the friend is influencing her negatively. The author's main concern is the change in his girlfriend's behavior and the tension it creates. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. The author wants to address the issue by setting a boundary. Unless there's something else not mentioned here, like the girlfriend not being consulted about the friend's visits, it seems like he's within his rights to ask her to stop bringing the friend over, especially given the negative impact.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's protecting his space and well-being, and the situations described justify his need to set boundaries.\n"
