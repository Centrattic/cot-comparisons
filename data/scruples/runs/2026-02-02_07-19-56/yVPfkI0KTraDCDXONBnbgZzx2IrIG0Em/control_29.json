I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The author is considering telling their girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore due to the friend's and girlfriend's negative behavior.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially stayed with the author as a temporary arrangement while her parents sorted things out. The author made it clear it was temporary. Now, the girlfriend is bringing her friend, and their interactions are causing tension. The author gives examples of the friend being rude and the girlfriend acting differently. The friend mocked the author about making snacks, and the girlfriend became defensive when the author wanted to play a game.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author's apartment is their space, and they should have a say in who enters it. The girlfriend was supposed to be a temporary guest, so inviting her friend might go beyond the agreed-upon terms. The author has valid reasons for feeling uncomfortable: the friend's behavior is hostile, and the girlfriend's demeanor changes negatively. The author isn't just being petty; there's actual conflict affecting their living environment.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the author should communicate this issue with the girlfriend first before banning the friend. The author mentions wanting to push the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents, which might resolve the temporary stay issue. But the immediate problem is the friend's presence causing distress. The author's right to their space and peace is important, and if the friend's behavior is toxic, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to a comfortable living environment and addressing ongoing issues that affect them. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
