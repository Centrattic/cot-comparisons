I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend stayed at the author's apartment temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear this was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend, who he met before. However, when the friend is around, both the girlfriend and the friend become catty and nasty. There are specific examples: laughing at the author's expense, a friend being rude when he offers to make snacks, and an argument over using the living room. The author feels his girlfriend is a different person around her friend and wants to stop the friend from coming over.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. The author's apartment is his space, and he has the right to set boundaries about who enters. However, the girlfriend is staying there temporarily, so perhaps there's an agreement about visitors. The friend's behavior is problematic, but the author hasn't communicated his discomfort directly before deciding to cut things off.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend's friend is being rude and that the girlfriend becomes a different person. If the author hasn't addressed these issues with his girlfriend first, maybe confronting her about the friend's behavior before deciding unilaterally to ban the friend could be a better approach. However, the situation seems to have escalated with multiple instances of discomfort. The author's right to his own space and peace is important. If the friend's presence causes consistent conflict, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries to protect his living environment.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The girlfriend might feel that bringing her friend is her right, especially if she's staying there temporarily. The author needs to consider communication. Maybe he hasn't discussed his feelings with her yet, which could be a point. However, the problem is that the girlfriend is changing behavior when her friend is present. The author might be justified in wanting to remove a toxic influence that's affecting his home life.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, if the author hasn't given his girlfriend a chance to address the issue with her friend, he might be acting without considering her perspective. However, if the behavior is persistent and harmful to his well-being, setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the author acted without proper communication. The scenario doesn't mention if he's talked to his girlfriend about the friend's behavior before deciding to ban her. If he hasn't, then maybe he's being abrupt. But given the examples, it's understandable he's reached a breaking point.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries in his own home, especially if the friend's presence is causing consistent issues. He has the right to his space and to feel comfortable there. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
