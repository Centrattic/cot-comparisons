I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to tell their girlfriend not to bring her friend to their apartment anymore. The girlfriend's friend is causing tension and the author feels disrespected by the friend's comments and the friend's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend came to stay temporarily after a family fight. The author was clear it was temporary. Then the friend started coming over, and the author noticed a change in the girlfriend's behavior when the friend is around. There are specific incidents where the friend was rude, and the author felt targeted. The author wants to stop the friend from coming over and push the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's main issue is the girlfriend's friend causing problems. The author is feeling disrespected and uncomfortable. The friend's comments were hostile, and the girlfriend's attitude changed. The author is considering setting a boundary by not allowing the friend to visit. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to set this boundary? Well, in a relationship, partners have the right to set boundaries regarding their living space. If the friend's presence is causing conflict and disrespect, the author is within their rights to address it. However, maybe the author should talk to the girlfriend first to understand her perspective and resolve the issue together instead of making a unilateral decision. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting in self-defense to protect their living environment and well-being, then they're not in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's desire to set limits. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's change in behavior might be a red flag. The author is trying to maintain their own comfort and the relationship's health. Unless there's a cultural or situational nuance I'm missing, the author's actions seem reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
