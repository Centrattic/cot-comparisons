I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether the person who wrote this is wrong for wanting to tell their girlfriend not to bring her friend to their apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's girlfriend stayed with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. The girlfriend started bringing her friend over, and the author noticed a change in her behavior. The friend and girlfriend became \"nasty\" and \"catty,\" leading to awkward situations. There are specific incidents where the friend was rude, like making a sarcastic comment about the author offering to make snacks, and another where they complained about the author playing a game. The author feels that this friend's presence is causing tension and wants to stop it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide this, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is in his own apartment, so he has the right to set boundaries about who visits. If the girlfriend's friend is making him uncomfortable and affecting their relationship, it's reasonable for him to address it. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her friend is important to her and that the author is being controlling or not understanding her need for support during a stressful time.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's right to his living space and the girlfriend's right to socialize. The author was clear that the stay was temporary, but the situation extended beyond that. If the friend's presence is creating a hostile environment, the author has a valid reason to set limits. The girlfriend changing her behavior around her friend could indicate that the friend has a negative influence, which the author is justified in wanting to correct.\n\nHowever, the author should approach this communication carefully. He needs to express his feelings without blaming her, perhaps understanding why she brings her friend over. Maybe the friend is a source of support for her, and there's an underlying issue that needs addressing. The author also mentions wanting to encourage her to reconcile with her parents, which might relate to the stress she's under.\n\nIn terms of the specific incidents, the friend's rude comments and the girlfriend's attitude suggest that the dynamic is indeed problematic. The author isn't just being sensitive; there are concrete examples of negative behavior. Therefore, setting boundaries by asking the girlfriend not to bring her friend is reasonable. The author isn't forbidding all social interaction but is protecting his living space and his well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He has the right to his space and is addressing a valid concern. The correct choice is B.\n"
