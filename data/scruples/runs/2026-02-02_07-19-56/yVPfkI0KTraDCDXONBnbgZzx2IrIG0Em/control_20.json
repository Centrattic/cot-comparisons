I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend bringing her friend over to the author's apartment, which starts causing tension.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend initially came to stay because of a family conflict, and the arrangement was temporary. The author was clear about that. Then the girlfriend starts bringing her friend, which the author finds problematic. \n\nThe author mentions specific incidents where the friend and girlfriend become catty and disrespectful. There's laughter at his expense, a dismissive comment from the friend, and a situation where the girlfriend and her friend mock him. The author wants to stop the girlfriend from bringing the friend over and to encourage her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author's concern is about their own comfort and the change in his girlfriend's behavior. He's not wrong to feel uncomfortable in his own home when others are being disrespectful. He's trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, is there a lack of communication? The author hasn't directly addressed the issue with his girlfriend yet. He's considering telling her, but hasn't done so. Is it wrong to want to set boundaries after experiencing disrespect? Probably not. The girlfriend's friend's behavior is hostile, and the author has the right to feel that's not acceptable in his space.\n\nThe girlfriend might be in a vulnerable state due to the family conflict, which could affect her behavior. However, the friend's actions are clearly crossing a line. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to prevent further conflict in his home. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to maintain his living space's peace and dealing with a situation where others are disrespectful. Answer B.\n"
