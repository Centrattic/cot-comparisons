I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering telling their girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author was clear it was temporary. Then, the girlfriend started bringing her friend, who the author met before. The problem is that when the friend is around, the girlfriend becomes a different person\u2014nasty and catty. There are specific incidents: laughing at him, a friend being rude, and an argument where the friend and girlfriend complained about him. The author wants to stop the girlfriend from bringing her friend over and push her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that their living space is being invaded, and their girlfriend's behavior changes, making the environment unpleasant. They have specific examples of uncomfortable interactions. On the other hand, the girlfriend's friend might have her own reasons for being there, and maybe the author didn't communicate his discomfort early enough. Also, the girlfriend's behavior change could be due to stress from her family issues.\n\nBut, the author did mention that the arrangement was temporary. If the girlfriend is extending her stay beyond that, maybe that's an issue. Also, the author has a right to his living space. The friend's behavior seems disrespectful. However, the author hasn't discussed these issues with the girlfriend before deciding to cut off the friend. Maybe addressing the problem together would be better. But the author's main point is that the girlfriend is acting differently, which is causing conflict. It's possible the friend's presence is triggering negative behavior in the girlfriend. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author hasn't had a talk about these incidents yet. But given the repeated issues, the author is justified in feeling their boundaries are crossed. The girlfriend's friend's comments were rude, and the girlfriend's attitude changed. The author's decision to set a boundary might be necessary to protect their own well-being. However, the author should have probably approached the situation with the girlfriend first rather than making a unilateral decision. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to set this boundary, considering the examples given, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have valid reasons for their discomfort. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
