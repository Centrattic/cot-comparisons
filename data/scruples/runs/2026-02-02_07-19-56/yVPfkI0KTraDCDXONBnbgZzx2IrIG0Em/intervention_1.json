I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who's dating a girl, and she's been staying with him because of a fight with her parents. She started bringing her friend over, and he's had issues with their behavior. The main points are the friend being rude, the girlfriend acting differently around her friend, and the guy feeling uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the guy says he set up the arrangement as temporary. Now he's considering telling her not to bring the friend anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, the guy's arguments: the friend is making him uncomfortable, the girlfriend acts differently, and there are specific incidents where the friend was rude. He wants to enforce boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend is still staying with him, which might be complicating things. Also, bringing friends over is a common social activity, so maybe the guy is overreacting?\n\nBut the key here is about mutual respect and communication. The guy has a right to feel uncomfortable and set boundaries in his own space. However, he should communicate this to his girlfriend first, maybe talk to her about how it's affecting him and see if she's willing to address it. If the friend is being rude, that's another issue. But the question is whether the author is wrong to want to stop the friend from coming over.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is staying with him temporarily, and he might be feeling that his personal space is being invaded. He has the right to his own living space, so setting boundaries makes sense. However, he should handle it by discussing it with his girlfriend rather than making a unilateral decision. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting to tell her no.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, maybe because he hasn't communicated properly with his girlfriend first. But if he's decided to take action, maybe he's justified. The answer depends on whether setting boundaries in one's home is wrong. Typically, people set boundaries for their homes, so the author isn't in the wrong. Unless there's an agreement about guests, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
