I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nSo, the situation is that the girlfriend is staying with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. The girlfriend brings a friend over, and the author notices that both the girlfriend and the friend act differently around him\u2014catty and mean. There are specific examples like laughing at him, making sarcastic comments, and arguing over a game. The author wants to stop the friend from coming over and maybe push the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's sharing his apartment, which is his space. He's given the understanding that the stay is temporary. He's uncomfortable with the friend's presence because it changes the dynamic with his girlfriend. The friend's behavior is hostile towards him, which is valid for him to be upset about. The girlfriend's behavior also changes, which he finds troubling. So, he wants to set boundaries. That seems reasonable.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong. Why might that be? Maybe because the author is being too controlling or not giving the girlfriend enough credit. But the girlfriend's friend's behavior is actually the problem here. The friend is rude and dismissive, and the girlfriend is acting differently when the friend is around. The author isn't just excluding the friend without reason; there are specific incidents that justify his discomfort.\n\nAnother angle: Communication. The author hasn't talked to the girlfriend yet, just considering it. But the scenario is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The key point is that the friend's presence is causing conflict and making the author uncomfortable. People have the right to set boundaries in their home. The friend's behavior is problematic, which is a valid reason for the author to want to stop the visits.\n\nHowever, there's a risk of the author overreacting or misinterpreting the situation. But the examples given are specific and seem to indicate real issues. The friend's comment about the man having an opinion being a \"shocker\" is clearly disrespectful. The girlfriend's friend's sour look and the bitching after the game are also valid issues. The author isn't just being paranoid; there's a pattern of behavior that's affecting him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to protect his living space and his comfort. The friend's actions are the main problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
