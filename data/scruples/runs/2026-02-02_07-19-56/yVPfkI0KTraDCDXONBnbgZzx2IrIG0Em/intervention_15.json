I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy whose girlfriend came to stay with him after a fight with her parents. He told her it was temporary until they made up. Then the girlfriend started bringing her friend over. The author met the friend before and thought she was okay. But when the friend is around, both the girlfriend and the friend become \"nasty\" and \"catty.\" There are a few examples given where the friend and girlfriend act in ways that make the author uncomfortable. For instance, when he walks in, they laugh at him, the friend makes a sarcastic comment about him making snacks, and the last example where the girlfriend and friend argue when he wants to play a game. The author wants to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend anymore and maybe encourage her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I think the key points here are about communication, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author allowed his girlfriend to stay temporarily. Then, the girlfriend started bringing her friend, which the author didn't agree to. The author might feel that his space and comfort are being invaded. The friend's behavior and the girlfriend's change in demeanor when the friend is around could be problematic. However, the author did not address the issue directly with his girlfriend before deciding to cut off the friend. Instead of communicating his discomfort, he's planning to just tell her no more visits. That might be a problem because it's important to talk to your partner about such issues before making unilateral decisions.\n\nAlso, the author is considering pushing his girlfriend to reconcile with her parents, which might be a separate issue. The girlfriend might need to resolve her family conflict, but the author's approach could be seen as imposing his will on her. However, given that the temporary arrangement was supposed to be until reconciliation, maybe the author has a point there.\n\nThe main conflict is about the friend's visits. The author didn't set boundaries from the start. Maybe he should have discussed his discomfort with the girlfriend first. If he had communicated that the friend's presence was affecting their dynamic, they could have worked together on a solution. By deciding unilaterally to stop the friend from coming, he might be overstepping without considering his girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend might value her friend and feel that her partner is being controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior does seem toxic. The examples given (laughing at the author, sarcastic comments, arguing about game time) suggest that the friend is disrespectful. The author has a right to feel comfortable in his own home. However, the appropriate way to handle this is to talk to his girlfriend about the situation, express his feelings, and see if they can find a solution together. Cutting off the friend without discussing it with his girlfriend might damage the relationship, as it could be perceived as a lack of trust or respect for her social life.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach of just telling the girlfriend to stop bringing the friend might be seen as abrupt and not considering her feelings. It's possible that the girlfriend is unaware of how her friend's behavior is affecting her partner. By addressing the issue directly with her, the author could help her understand the problem, and together they might decide if the friend's visits need to change.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be valid, the method of handling the situation could be at fault. The mistake is not in wanting to set boundaries, but in not communicating with his girlfriend first. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not addressing the issue through dialogue before making a decision.\n"
