I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship and has been allowing his girlfriend to stay at his apartment after a conflict with her parents. He explicitly said it was temporary. Then, the girlfriend starts bringing her friend over. The author mentions that when this friend is around, his girlfriend becomes \"nasty\" and \"catty.\" There are specific incidents where the friend and girlfriend have been dismissive or rude to him. The friend even made a sarcastic comment when he offered to make snacks. The last straw was when the girlfriend and friend complained about him while he was playing a game. The author now wants to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore and encourage her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are mutual respect and boundaries. The author had a temporary arrangement with his girlfriend, and it's clear he didn't expect her to bring her friend. The girlfriend's behavior changes significantly in her friend's presence, which the author finds uncomfortable and disrespectful. The friend's comments are clearly hostile, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe author is not asking to ban the friend outright but to stop bringing her to his apartment. Given that the friend's presence is causing conflict and the girlfriend is acting differently around her, the author has a right to set boundaries in his own home. The girlfriend's friend's behavior seems to contribute to the problem. The author isn't trying to control his girlfriend's social life entirely but is asking her to respect his space and the original agreement of the temporary stay.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how her friend's presence was affecting the author. It's possible she didn't intend to overstay or bring her friend without discussing it. However, the author had made the arrangement temporary, and introducing another person into the situation without considering his feelings might be an issue. But the main problem here is the friend's behavior and how it affects the relationship. The author is responding to actual incidents of disrespect and conflict, so setting a boundary by asking her not to bring the friend is reasonable.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
