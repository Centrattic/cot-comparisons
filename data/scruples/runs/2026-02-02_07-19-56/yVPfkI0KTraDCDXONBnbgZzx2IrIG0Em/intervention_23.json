I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's considering telling his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend stayed with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. The guy was clear it was temporary. Then her friend started coming over, and he noticed that the girlfriend and her friend act differently, getting \"nasty\" and \"catty.\" There are specific incidents mentioned: one where they laughed at him when he came home, another where the friend cut him off rudely, and finally an incident where his girlfriend and her friend complained about him after he asked them to move to the bedroom so he could play a game.\n\nThe guy feels that his girlfriend is a different person when her friend is around. He wants to stop her from bringing the friend and maybe push her to reconcile with her parents. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but is that accurate?\n\nHmm. Let's consider communication and boundaries. The guy is in his own apartment, so he has the right to set boundaries. If the friend's presence is making him uncomfortable and affecting his relationship negatively, it's reasonable for him to address it. However, he should communicate this to his girlfriend first before taking action. The key here is whether he's acting out of valid concern or overstepping.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her friend is part of her support system, especially if she's dealing with family issues. Cutting off the friend without understanding the dynamics could cause conflict. But the guy has legitimate reasons\u2014his own comfort, the friend's behavior, and the girlfriend's changed demeanor. He's not just being petty; there are specific incidents where the friend was rude.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but from the description, the guy is trying to protect his space and address the negative impact. He's not banning the friend without talking to his girlfriend, but he's planning to. The question is whether he's wrong in wanting to set these boundaries. Considering that he's the host of the apartment and the friend's presence is causing him stress, it's not necessarily wrong. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
