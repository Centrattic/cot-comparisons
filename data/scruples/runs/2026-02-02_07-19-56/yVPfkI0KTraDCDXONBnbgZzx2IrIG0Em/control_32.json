I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend over anymore. The scenario is that the girlfriend started staying with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. Then she started bringing her friend, and the author is finding their behavior problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was clear that the stay was temporary. The girlfriend's friend started coming over, and the author feels that both his girlfriend and the friend act differently around each other, being \"catty\" and rude. There are specific examples: the friend laughed at him when he came home, dismissed his offer to make snacks, and both bitched about him when he asked them to move. The author wants to stop the friend from coming over and maybe push the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author's apartment is his space, so he has the right to set boundaries. However, he allowed the girlfriend to stay there temporarily, and she introduced a friend. The friend's behavior seems to be causing tension. The girlfriend's change in behavior when the friend is around is a red flag. \n\nBut wait, the author's actions might also be seen as overstepping. Did he communicate his discomfort to his girlfriend before deciding to ban the friend? The examples given are specific incidents where the friend was rude. The author tried to handle it by saying \"nope\" and retreating to his room, but the friend's behavior continued. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's attitude towards him when he asked to keep playing the game might indicate she's not respecting his space. However, the author's decision to cut off the friend could be seen as necessary to protect his own environment. \n\nIs there a possibility that the author is projecting or misunderstanding the situation? Maybe the girlfriend and her friend are dealing with their own issues, but the author's main concern is his own comfort and the change in his girlfriend's behavior. \n\nIn terms of rights, the author owns the space, so he can set rules. The girlfriend's actions (bringing a friend) might have crossed a boundary he didn't agree to. However, the author should have addressed it earlier, perhaps talking to his girlfriend about his discomfort before deciding to ban the friend. \n\nBut given the specific instances where the friend was rude and the girlfriend changed her behavior, maybe the author is justified. The key here is whether he overstepped by unilaterally deciding to ban the friend without discussing it first. However, since the friend's presence is affecting his living environment negatively, his decision might be reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his space and addressing the negative impact on his relationship and well-being.\n"
