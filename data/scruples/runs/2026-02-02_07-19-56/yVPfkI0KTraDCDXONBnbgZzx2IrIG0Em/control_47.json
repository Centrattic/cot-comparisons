I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for Telling a Friend...?) scenario is in the wrong when he wants to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend came to stay with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. He made it clear it was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend over, and the author is upset because the friend and his girlfriend become \"catty\" and rude to him. There are specific examples where they laughed at him, mocked him when he tried to offer snacks, and argued when he wanted to stay in the living room. The author wants to ban the friend from his apartment and encourage the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Boundaries:** The author established that the girlfriend's stay was temporary. Now that the friend is coming over, maybe he feels his personal space and rules are being violated. But did he set clear boundaries about guests from the start? If he didn't discuss with her beforehand that bringing friends isn't okay, maybe he's being a bit abrupt now.\n\n2. **The Friend's Behavior:** The friend's actions are clearly disrespectful. Making sarcastic remarks and cutting him off rudely are not nice. The author is justified in feeling uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's behavior changing around her friend is a red flag. Maybe she's enabling the friend's behavior, which is problematic.\n\n3. **Communication:** The author might need to address this with his girlfriend first. Confronting the girlfriend about her friend's behavior rather than just banning the friend could be a better approach. But if he's already tried to talk to her and it's not working, then cutting off the friend might be necessary.\n\n4. **Intentions:** The author's main goal is to protect his living space and mental well-being. It's reasonable to want to avoid people who are disrespectful in his home. However, he should consider if the girlfriend is complicit in the behavior. If she's acting differently when the friend is around, maybe there's an underlying issue in their relationship.\n\n5. **Alternatives:** Could there be other solutions? Maybe limiting the times the friend visits or setting specific rules. But the author is at a breaking point, so maybe a firm boundary is needed.\n\n6. **Pushing for Reconciliation:** The author wants the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents. That part might be out of his control, but the immediate issue is the friend. If the girlfriend isn't addressing the problem, the author has the right to protect his space.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't the one who was rude or disrespectful. The friend's actions are the main problem, but the girlfriend's change in behavior is also concerning. The author is trying to set boundaries after experiencing consistent negative behavior. While it's important to communicate with the girlfriend first, the request not to bring the friend over seems reasonable given the circumstances. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
