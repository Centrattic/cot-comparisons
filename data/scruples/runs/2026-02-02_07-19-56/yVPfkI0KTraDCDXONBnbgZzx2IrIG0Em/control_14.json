I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend started bringing her friend to their apartment after coming to stay there temporarily. The author is upset because the girlfriend and her friend behave differently and inconsiderately, leading to several awkward and disrespectful incidents. The author wants to tell the girlfriend that the friend can't come anymore and encourage her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The initial arrangement was temporary for the girlfriend to stay until she made up with her parents. The friend's presence is causing the girlfriend to act out of character, which is problematic. The author has given specific examples of disrespectful behavior from the friend and the girlfriend, such as laughing at the author's expense, condescending remarks, and the friend making a sarcastic comment. These incidents are causing the author stress and making him feel disrespected in his own home.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to set a boundary. Boundaries in relationships are important. If the girlfriend's friend is making the author uncomfortable and altering the girlfriend's behavior negatively, it's reasonable for the author to address this. The girlfriend's friend's behavior seems to be contributing to a toxic environment. The author isn't being hostile without cause; he's responding to specific actions that have made him feel unwelcome in his own space.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author might be overreacting. Maybe the girlfriend's friend isn't at fault, or maybe the girlfriend is allowing her influence too much. But given the examples provided, the friend's comments and the girlfriend's changed demeanor are clear issues. The author's desire to maintain his living space free from disrespect is valid. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend was already staying temporarily, and the friend's visits were not part of the original agreement. The author had to adjust to her staying but now the friend's presence adds another layer of stress. The author's request to stop the friend from coming over is a way to protect his personal space and well-being. It's a reasonable boundary, not an overreaction.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the friend is important to her, but if the friend's presence is causing conflict and disrespect, the author has the right to set limits. The key here is mutual respect and clear communication. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the girlfriend's need for her friend's support, but he's also asserting his own needs. Since the situation is causing stress and the examples are valid, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
