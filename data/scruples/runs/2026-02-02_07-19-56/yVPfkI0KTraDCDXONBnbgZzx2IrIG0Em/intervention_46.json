I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't bring her friend anymore. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend came to stay because of a family issue, and it was supposed to be temporary. Then she started bringing a friend. The author is upset because the friend and the girlfriend act differently around each other, leading to awkward and confrontational situations. There are specific incidents mentioned, like the friend being rude and the girlfriend getting defensive.\n\nThe author wants to stop the girlfriend from bringing her friend over. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable in his own space. If the friend is being rude and the girlfriend is acting differently, it's valid for him to set boundaries. He's not saying the girlfriend can't have friends, but specifically this friend. He also mentions wanting to encourage her to reconcile with her parents, which might be part of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier or communicated better. Maybe he could have talked to both the girlfriend and the friend about how their behavior is affecting him. But the girlfriend is acting differently around the friend, which complicates things. The friend's behavior seems dismissive, like when she cut him off and said \"shocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it.\" That's pretty harsh.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe not. If his own girlfriend is acting out of character and the friend is being rude, it's reasonable to set boundaries. He's sharing an apartment, which is a personal space. The friend's presence is causing conflict, so removing them might be necessary for his well-being.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for just cutting things off? The girlfriend might feel this is sudden. Should he have tried to talk to her first? Probably. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether ending the friend's visits is a fair boundary. Since the friend's behavior is problematic, the author isn't necessarily wrong to set that boundary. So I think the answer is B, No.\n"
