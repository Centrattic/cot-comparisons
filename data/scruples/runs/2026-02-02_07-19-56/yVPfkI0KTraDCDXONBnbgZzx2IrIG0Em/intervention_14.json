I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) post is in the wrong when considering telling his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The girlfriend and her parents had a fight, so she moved in temporarily with the author. The friend started visiting, and the author is noticing a change in her behavior. There are specific instances where the friend and girlfriend become \"catty\" and disrespectful towards the author. The friend even made a sarcastic comment about the man needing to have an opinion, and the girlfriend argued when the author wanted to keep playing his game. The author feels the girlfriend is a different person when her friend is around and wants to stop the friend from coming over. Also, he wants to push her to reconcile with her parents again.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion. So I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author's perspective: He provided a temporary place for his girlfriend during a family conflict, which is a common situation. He's not comfortable with the friend's presence because it leads to tension and disrespect. He's given examples where his presence is dismissed and he's mocked. His intention is to protect his living space and mental well-being. \n\nGirlfriend's and friend's perspective: The girlfriend came to his apartment for support during a family issue, and bringing her friend might be her way of coping or feeling more comfortable. The friend's behavior could be defensive or part of a pattern they're not aware of. Maybe the girlfriend is feeling pressure and takes it out on the author through her friend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's setting boundaries for his own comfort. If the friend's visits are making him uncomfortable and the girlfriend is acting differently, it's reasonable for him to address it. However, he should consider how to communicate this. The post mentions he's \"really clear\" that the stay was temporary, so the friend's presence now might be complicating that. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend's friend is consistently disrespectful, the author has the right to ask her not to bring her. However, he should approach this with the girlfriend, not just an ultimatum. The user's initial thought was the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the idea that he's excluding someone without understanding the girlfriend's side. \n\nWait, the author is considering telling his girlfriend to stop bringing the friend over. That's about his own space and comfort. The girlfriend's behavior is changing, which the author has noticed. So the author isn't necessarily wrong if he's experiencing disrespect and wants to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the friend is a support system, and cutting her off could strain their relationship. The author should consider discussing this with his girlfriend first, understanding her perspective, and both working on a solution. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend's behavior is uncharacteristic and the friend is contributing to a hostile environment, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe because the girlfriend's action of bringing a friend is seen as her right, but the author is overstepping. However, the friend's behavior is part of the issue. The author's apartment is his space, so he can set rules about who comes in. If the friend is being rude, the author has the right to object. \n\nSo, based on the analysis, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer is B.\n"
