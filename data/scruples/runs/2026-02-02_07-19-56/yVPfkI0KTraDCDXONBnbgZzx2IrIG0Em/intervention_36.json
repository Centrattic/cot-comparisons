I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend temporarily stayed with her boyfriend because of a fight with her parents. The boyfriend made it clear this was temporary. Then, the girlfriend starts bringing her friend over. The boyfriend notices that his girlfriend and her friend act differently around him\u2014mocking him, being catty, and even disrespectful when he offers to make snacks. There's an incident where the friend makes a sarcastic comment, and the girlfriend's attitude changes. The last straw is when they want the living room, he refuses to move, and they end up bitching about him. The boyfriend wants to tell her not to bring the friend anymore and push her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's behavior change when her friend is around, the friend's hostility, and the boyfriend's right to set boundaries in his own home. \n\nThe boyfriend is living in his own apartment, so he has the right to set rules about who is allowed there. If the girlfriend's friend is making him uncomfortable and the girlfriend is acting differently, that's a valid reason for him to express his discomfort. Relationships require communication and boundaries. The boyfriend isn't being unreasonable by setting a boundary in his space. The girlfriend's friend's behavior seems to be the main issue here, not the boyfriend. \n\nHowever, maybe the boyfriend should have addressed the issue earlier or communicated his feelings to his girlfriend before cutting off the friend entirely. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to do so. Since the friend's presence is causing conflict and the girlfriend is changing her behavior, the boyfriend's decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. He's protecting his own comfort and environment. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
