I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Redditing-style question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who wants to tell his girlfriend not to bring her friend to their apartment anymore due to the friend's and girlfriend's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy allowed his girlfriend to stay with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. He set clear boundaries that this was temporary. Then, the girlfriend starts bringing her friend over, which leads to various incidents where the guy feels disrespected and uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are the boundaries and communication. The guy initially agreed to her staying temporarily, but the girlfriend introduced her friend into the equation without considering his comfort. The friend's behavior is hostile, and the girlfriend's behavior changes when her friend is around, which is a red flag. \n\nThe guy's actions are about setting boundaries in his own living space. He's the one renting the apartment, so he has the right to control who comes in. The girlfriend's friend is causing issues, and the girlfriend isn't standing up for him, which suggests there might be some favoritism or codependency issues between the two friends. \n\nHowever, the guy didn't communicate his discomfort earlier. He waited until after multiple incidents. But in the last incident, he confronted the girlfriend about moving to the bedroom, which led to the argument. Now he wants to address the friend's presence. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if he's justified. If the friend's presence is making him uncomfortable and the girlfriend is acting differently, then he's within his rights to set boundaries. On the other hand, if he hadn't communicated his issues earlier, maybe he's part of the problem. But given that the situation escalated with multiple incidents, his decision to address it now seems reasonable. \n\nAlso, maybe the girlfriend should be handling her friend's behavior, but since she's not, the guy is trying to protect his space. So, I think he's justified in wanting to set that boundary. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
