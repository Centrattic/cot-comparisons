I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend bringing her friend over to the author's apartment, and he's had multiple issues with her behavior. The question is whether he's justified in telling her not to bring the friend anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend initially came to stay because of a family issue, and the arrangement was supposed to be temporary. Then she started bringing her friend, which the author didn't mind at first. However, there are several incidents where her friend's behavior is problematic. The author feels disrespected and uncomfortable in these situations. \n\nThe friend and girlfriend act differently around each other, becoming \"catty\" and making the author feel laughed at. There's an instance where the friend rudely dismissed his offer to make snacks, using a sarcastic remark. Another time, they demanded the living room for themselves, leading to the author hearing them complain about him. The author is frustrated because his girlfriend is usually kind but changes around her friend.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author's apartment is his space, and he's within his rights to set boundaries. He's not wrong for wanting to protect his environment from disrespectful behavior. The girlfriend's friend's actions have crossed into disrespecting him, which is a valid reason to ask her not to come over. \n\nThe girlfriend's part is a bit tricky. If she's aware of her friend's behavior and still brings her over despite the author's discomfort, that's an issue. The author communicated his discomfort, but maybe not clearly enough. However, the main problem here is the friend's conduct, not the author inviting her initially. The author's request to stop the visits is a reasonable response to protect his living space and mental well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in setting these boundaries given the disrespect shown by the friend and the change in his girlfriend's behavior.\n"
