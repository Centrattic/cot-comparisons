I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend has been staying with him after a fight with her parents, and things were okay until her friend started coming over. The author is upset because when the friend is there, the girlfriend acts differently\u2014being catty, making him feel laughed at, and even dismissing his presence. The author wants to tell the girlfriend to stop bringing her friend over.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect in the relationship. The author clearly communicated that the stay was temporary, so maybe the girlfriend staying longer than expected is an issue. However, the main problem is the friend's presence and how it affects their dynamic.\n\nThe author mentions specific incidents where he felt disrespected by the friend and his girlfriend. The friend's comment about the man having an opinion being a \"shocker\" is particularly hurtful. The girlfriend's change in behavior around her friend is significant. The author wants to set a boundary by not allowing the friend to come over anymore, which seems reasonable if the friend's presence is causing a toxic environment.\n\nBut are there any aspects where the author might be at fault? Maybe he didn't address the issue sooner, allowing the situation to escalate. Perhaps he should have discussed his discomfort with the girlfriend earlier instead of letting it build up. However, the girlfriend is changing her behavior when her friend is present, which points more towards the friend's influence rather than the author's actions.\n\nThe author wants to push the girlfriend to reconcile with her parents, which might be a good idea if the stay was supposed to be temporary, but that's separate from the friend issue. The main question is about the friend's presence. The author's intention is to stop further conflict and restore peace in their living space, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author hasn't communicated his feelings to the girlfriend about how the friend's presence affects him, maybe he should have done that first. But since he is now considering setting a boundary, it's a proactive step. The friend's behavior seems to be the root of the problem, not the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set this boundary. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
