I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who lives with his girlfriend. They had a temporary arrangement where she moved in after a fight with her parents. The girlfriend started bringing her friend over, and the author is upset because her behavior changes when the friend is around. He's had multiple awkward or confrontational interactions with her friend and the girlfriend, and he wants to tell her the friend can't come over anymore.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author was clear from the start that the arrangement was temporary. The girlfriend brought her friend over without consulting him, which might be a red flag. The friend's behavior seems hostile, and the girlfriend acts differently in her presence. The author wants to set boundaries, which is reasonable for someone living in their own space.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated his discomfort earlier instead of waiting for multiple incidents. But given the context\u2014his girlfriend's friend is making him uncomfortable and the girlfriend is acting differently\u2014it seems like he has valid reasons to set boundaries. The friend's comments were disrespectful, and the girlfriend's attitude suggests she's not respecting his space. \n\nThe answer probably isn't in the author's favor if we consider that maybe he's being too quick to cut things off. But the main point is that he's standing up for his space and comfort. The girlfriend might need to address why her friend is causing issues. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries to protect his living environment. So the answer is B.\n"
