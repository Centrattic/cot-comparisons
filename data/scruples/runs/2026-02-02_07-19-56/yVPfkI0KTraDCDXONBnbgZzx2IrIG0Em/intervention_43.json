I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves his girlfriend bringing a friend over to their apartment, and he's having issues with the friend's behavior and the girlfriend's change in demeanor.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially came to stay because of a fight with her parents, and the author made it clear this was temporary. Now she's bringing her friend, which wasn't part of the original agreement. The author is uncomfortable with the friend's behavior\u2014specifically, the friend being catty, making sarcastic comments, and the girlfriend acting more aggressively around her. There are instances where the friend laughs at the author's expense, dismisses his offer to make snacks, and the girlfriend becomes argumentative. The author also hears the friend and girlfriend complaining about him when he's nearby.\n\nThe author wants to tell the girlfriend not to bring the friend anymore. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the situation, the author provided specific examples of discomfort. The friend's behavior seems disrespectful, and the girlfriend changes her personality when the friend is around. Since the author's space in the apartment is being affected\u2014his ability to relax and play games without being interrupted or criticized\u2014he has a valid reason to be upset. The fact that the arrangement was supposed to be temporary adds to the issue; bringing friends might disrupt the temporary stay.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have communicated his discomfort earlier instead of letting things escalate. But considering the specific incidents, it's understandable he's frustrated. The girlfriend might need to be aware of how her friend's presence affects the author. The author isn't just being petty; he's addressing real behaviors that are making him uncomfortable in his own home. \n\nSince the girlfriend is acting differently around the friend, there might be underlying issues in their relationship. The author's request to stop the friend from coming over is about maintaining his own space and comfort, especially in a shared living situation. It's reasonable for him to set boundaries here. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But wait, maybe the girlfriend's friend is just a different personality, and the author is overreacting? The examples given do seem significant, though. The friend's comments are outright rude, and the girlfriend's attitude is problematic. The author isn't wrong to want to address this. So, B makes sense.\n"
