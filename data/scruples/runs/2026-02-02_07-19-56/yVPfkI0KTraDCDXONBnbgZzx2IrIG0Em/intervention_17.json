I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't bring her friend to his apartment anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend moved in temporarily after a fight with her parents. The author made it clear it was temporary. Then, the girlfriend started bringing her friend over. The author has had several negative experiences with these visits. The friend and girlfriend become catty, there's been awkwardness, a rude comment from the friend, and the girlfriend being rude to the author. The author is now considering telling her to stop bringing the friend over and pushing her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is a guest in his own apartment. He has the right to set boundaries about who is allowed in his space. If the friend's presence is causing discomfort and the girlfriend's behavior changes negatively, it's reasonable for him to address it. The author has provided specific examples of how the friend and girlfriend's interactions are unpleasant and even disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier. He mentioned the girlfriend's behavior changes, but he only acted after several incidents. Also, the girlfriend's friend might not be the root cause but a symptom. The girlfriend's own behavior when the friend is around is a key point. The author might need to communicate his feelings to her first before setting such a strict rule.\n\nHowever, the scenario does show a pattern of negative interactions. The author isn't just being overly sensitive; these are repeated incidents. The friend's comment about the man having an opinion was clearly disrespectful. The girlfriend's attitude and the friend's sour look suggest a hostile environment. The author's decision to set a boundary by not allowing the friend in his apartment is about his comfort and well-being. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but based on the provided details, the author is acting within his rights to maintain his living space's atmosphere. He hasn't acted impulsively but after multiple negative experiences. Therefore, the correct answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
