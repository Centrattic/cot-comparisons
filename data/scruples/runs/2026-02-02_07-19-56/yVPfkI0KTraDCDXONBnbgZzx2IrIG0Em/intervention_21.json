I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. The scenario involves some conflicts between the author, his girlfriend, and her friend. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's friend is coming over to their apartment. The author met her before and thought she was okay. But when she's there, the dynamic changes. The girlfriend becomes a different person, and the friend is also being catty. There are specific incidents mentioned: one where they laugh at the author when he comes home, another where the friend rudely cuts him off when he tries to offer snacks, and a final incident where the friend and girlfriend argue over the author wanting to play a game. The author is frustrated and wants to stop the friend from coming over.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The author's apartment is his space, and he has the right to set boundaries. The girlfriend was supposed to stay temporarily until she made up with her parents, but now she's bringing friends over. The author is upset because the friend's presence changes the girlfriend's behavior. The key points are whether the author is justified in setting this boundary.\n\nThe author is not being confrontational upfront. He's letting things happen until they become a problem. The incidents described are instances where the friend and girlfriend are dismissive and rude. The author's reactions are to ignore the friend's rudeness and retreat to his room. The final straw is the argument where he's trying to play a game, and they dismiss his activity. The author wants to address this by stopping her from bringing the friend over.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's in his own home, so he can set rules. The girlfriend might feel that her friend is important, but the author's comfort and mental well-being are also valid. The problem is that the girlfriend and her friend are being disrespectful. The author isn't being hostile; he's trying to communicate boundaries. The user said the author is in the wrong, but maybe they think the girlfriend has a right to her friend. However, the author has the right to his space. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's acting to protect his living environment from someone whose presence causes conflict. The girlfriend might need to address her behavior with the friend as well. The author isn't wrong for setting this boundary.\n"
