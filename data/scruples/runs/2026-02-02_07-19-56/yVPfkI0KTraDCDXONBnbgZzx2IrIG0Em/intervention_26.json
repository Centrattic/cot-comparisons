I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend started staying with him after a fight with her parents, and now she's bringing her friend over. The author is upset because when the friend is around, the girlfriend becomes \"nasty\" and catty. There are specific incidents mentioned where the friend made sarcastic comments, laughed at the author, and the girlfriend's friend and friend-in-law (the author) had conflicts. The author wants to tell the girlfriend not to bring the friend anymore and to push her to reconcile with her parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He provided a space for his girlfriend temporarily. The presence of her friend is causing tension and discomfort. He's trying to communicate his boundaries by not wanting the friend there anymore. His actions are about maintaining his own comfort and the peace in their living situation. He's not cutting the girlfriend off entirely but is addressing the presence of a third party causing issues. The key here is that he's setting boundaries about his home and how it's being used. If the girlfriend is changing her behavior around her friend, it's a red flag about their dynamic. The author has a right to his space and to feel comfortable there.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might feel that bringing a friend is a way to cope with the stress of her situation with her parents. The friend might be a support system for her during a tough time. However, the friend's behavior towards the author is problematic, and the girlfriend's change in demeanor when her friend is around is concerning. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why her friend is affecting their relationship so drastically.\n\nThe author's main issue is not with the girlfriend's presence but with the friend's behavior and how it's impacting their cohabitation. The author isn't being confrontational but is seeking to resolve the situation by setting boundaries. He's also considering the girlfriend's situation (pushing her to reconcile with her parents), which shows he's trying to address the root problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is within his rights to ask the girlfriend not to bring the friend over if it's causing conflict. The friend's behavior is disrespectful, and the girlfriend's change in behavior is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to maintain a peaceful living environment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
