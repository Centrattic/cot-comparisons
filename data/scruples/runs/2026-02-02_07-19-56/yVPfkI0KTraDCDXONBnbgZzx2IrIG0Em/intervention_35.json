I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is about a guy who's living with his girlfriend after she had a fight with her parents. She brought her friend over, and he's now considering telling her she can't bring her friend anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is concerned about his girlfriend's behavior changing when her friend is around. He gives examples of the friend being rude and his girlfriend acting differently. He's had multiple incidents where the interactions were awkward or unpleasant. The question is if he's in the wrong for wanting to set this boundary.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is setting boundaries for his own comfort. It's reasonable to have rules about who can come to your home, especially if it's affecting your living environment. On the other hand, maybe the author should communicate more first, like talking to his girlfriend about his concerns before cutting off the friend entirely.\n\nBut the author mentions that the girlfriend's friend's presence is causing tension and that the girlfriend acts differently around her. The author might be justified in feeling that his space is being invaded and that the friend's presence is negative. However, maybe the author should have addressed the issue with his girlfriend first instead of deciding unilaterally. \n\nAlso, the situation is temporary, as the girlfriend was staying with him until she made up with her parents. If the friend's presence is part of why they're not making up, maybe pushing her to talk to her parents is a good idea. But the main question is about the friend. \n\nIs it fair for the author to set that boundary? In a shared living space, people usually have the right to set rules about guests, especially if the guests are causing issues. So the author might have the right to ask the friend not to come over. But maybe he should approach it through communication with his girlfriend first. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the friend's behavior is disrespectful, then the author isn't in the wrong for protecting his space. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overreacting, and the girlfriend's friend isn't that bad. But the examples given seem to indicate that the friend is condescending or hostile. The friend's comment about the man having an opinion was dismissive and rude. So the author's feelings are valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set this boundary. He's justified in protecting his living environment. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
