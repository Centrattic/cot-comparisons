I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend has been staying with him temporarily after a fight with her parents. He made it clear that this was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend over, and the author is really uncomfortable with their behavior. The problem is that when the friend is around, the girlfriend acts differently, and there are specific incidents where the friend was rude or dismissive towards the author. The author wants to tell the girlfriend to stop bringing the friend over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue seems to be the behavior of the girlfriend and her friend when they're together. The girlfriend is usually sweet, but around this friend, she's catty. The friend has been disrespectful, like when she cut the author off with a sarcastic comment. The author also mentions that the friend and girlfriend were bitching about him after he moved to his room. These incidents seem to be causing real tension and discomfort for the author.\n\nThe author's intention is to set a boundary by asking the girlfriend to not bring the friend anymore. Is that reasonable? Well, since the apartment is the author's place, he has the right to set boundaries about who is in his home. If the friend's presence is making him uncomfortable and the girlfriend is acting differently, it's his right to address that. However, maybe the author should first talk to his girlfriend about the issues he's having with her friend. But given that the girlfriend is acting differently when the friend is around, maybe she's not even aware of it? The author might need to approach this carefully, but the main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to set this boundary.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend came to stay temporarily, and the author was accommodating. Now, after the situation has changed (with the friend's visits), the author wants to adjust the arrangement. That's understandable. The friend's behavior is hostile, which is a valid reason to set a boundary. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend to stop bringing the friend over. He's trying to protect his own space and well-being. The fact that the girlfriend's behavior changes could be a red flag, but the author isn't the one causing the problem here. The problem is the friend's influence. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
