I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  \n\nIt was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  \n\nMy girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it\u2019s bothered me.  \n\nThere was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m beat\u201d and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. \n\nAnother time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it\u2019d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend\u2019s friend cut me off and said, \u201cshocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it\u201d in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself \u201cwell fuck you too\u201d, but just said \u201cactually nope\u201d and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. \n\nThe situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn\u2019t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said \u201cnah I\u2019m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?\u201d   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime\u201d.  So I said, \u201c yeah I can play it anytime and I\u2019m playing it now\u201d.  Friend mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It\u2019s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  \n\nMy girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it\u2019s like a switch flips and she\u2019s a totally different person.  I don\u2019t get it.   I don\u2019t really want to, I just don\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong when considering telling his girlfriend she can't bring her friend over anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation described. The girlfriend initially came to stay with the author temporarily after a family fight. The author was clear it was temporary. Then she started bringing her friend, which led to several awkward and disrespectful incidents. The friend's behavior includes sarcasm and dismissive comments, and the girlfriend becomes catty and rude when the friend is around. The author feels uncomfortable and is considering setting a boundary.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and boundaries. The author had already made it clear that the stay was temporary. The girlfriend's friend's behavior is causing issues, and the author is reacting to protect their own comfort and space. \n\nIs there any indication that the author wronged the girlfriend? The author hasn't done anything to provoke this. The problem seems to stem from the girlfriend's friend and her friend's behavior affecting the relationship. The author is seeking to address a situation that's causing them stress and discomfort. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author wants to set a boundary to prevent further issues. Unless there's a history of the author being unreasonable or not communicating their feelings, it's reasonable for them to want to address the friend's presence. The girlfriend's change in behavior around her friend suggests that maybe there's an issue in her friendship or how she interacts with the author when the friend is present. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't acting out of malice. They're trying to protect their living space and emotional well-being. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
