I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The person is the one who owns a business and has trust issues from their parents' failed marriage. They mentioned wanting a prenup if they ever get married, which upset their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is based on their personal experiences and financial security. They built a business and have trust issues from family, so wanting a prenup makes sense for them. A prenup is a legal document that can protect individual assets in case of divorce, which is a common practice in many relationships, especially when there's significant personal wealth involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and called the author a distrustful asshole. Her reaction might stem from feeling that the author doesn't trust her or doesn't see marriage as a commitment. She might view the prenup as a lack of faith in the relationship's longevity or her intentions.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, wanting a prenup is not inherently wrong. It's a practical step many people take. However, communication is key in relationships. The author might not have explained their reasoning clearly enough, leading to hurt feelings. The fact that the author tried to explain it wasn't about distrust but about security could be a mitigating factor. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she might feel that the prenup request is a red flag or a sign of not being fully committed.\n\nThe author's age and the length of the relationship (3 years) suggest that they're considering marriage seriously. However, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she might have different expectations. It's possible that the author is being reasonable in wanting financial protection, especially given their personal history. However, the way the conversation went down might have been hurtful. The author should have approached the conversation with more empathy, considering the emotional impact on their partner.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people see prenups as a necessary step, others as a lack of trust. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. If the author and girlfriend can't agree on this, it might be an incompatibility in values rather than one person being in the wrong. However, since the author is the one who brought up the prenup, their stance is defensible, but their communication could have been better. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because wanting financial security and a prenup is reasonable, especially given their background. However, the way it was communicated could have been improved. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the prenup is a legitimate request, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid, so it's a bit of a mutual issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup.\n"
