I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to marry without a prenup. The situation is that the guy owns a business earning $150k+, built from scratch. He's seen his parents' failed marriage with trust issues. He told his girlfriend he's not sure about marriage and would want a prenup. She got upset, called him a distrustful asshole, and feels hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The man's reasons are based on his family background and personal experiences. He's concerned about protecting his assets, which is a valid legal consideration. Prenups are common in marriages where one or both partners have significant assets. His approach is practical, given his parents' history.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. Her reaction suggests that she may view a prenup as a lack of trust, even if that's not the case. Marriage is a big commitment, and for some, a prenup is a safeguard. The man's stance isn't about distrust in the relationship but about legal and financial protection.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a reasonable precaution, especially with his business. The issue might lie in communication. He might need to explain his reasoning better to her, addressing her feelings. However, his position isn't unethical or wrong. He has the right to protect his assets. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in that she feels hurt, but the man isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. So the answer would be B.\n"
