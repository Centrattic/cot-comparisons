I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a successful business and built it from scratch. They come from a family where their parents' marriage was problematic, leading to trust issues. They mention that they've never seen a successful marriage in their family. The girlfriend is 26, and they've been together three years, living together for 1.5 years. When the author brings up the idea of not wanting to marry without a prenup, the girlfriend reacts strongly, feeling insulted and hurt. The author explains it's about personal security, not distrust, but she's not receptive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is being cautious, especially given their family background and financial stake. A prenup is a common legal tool to protect assets, which makes sense if they have significant property or business. Their hesitation to marry without one might be seen as responsible, especially if they want to avoid potential conflicts in the future. They also mention trust issues, which is a personal history they're working on. So, their stance is grounded in personal experience and practicality.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and insulted. Marriage is a big commitment, and the idea of a prenup might come across as a lack of trust, even if that's not the intent. The author's family history might not be the girlfriend's, so she might not share the same perspective. If she views marriage as a symbol of complete trust and unity, the prenup could be a dealbreaker for her. The emotional response suggests that this issue is significant to her, and if she's not willing to negotiate, it might indicate a fundamental difference in how they view marriage and relationships.\n\nThe key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author's intention is about security and past experiences, while the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling valued and trusted. If both parties can't find common ground, it might be a dealbreaker. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup. It's a practical measure, especially given their financial situation and family history. The girlfriend's reaction is valid from her perspective, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for having their own needs and boundaries.\n\nIn terms of fairness, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's about protecting oneself legally, which many people see as responsible. The author isn't refusing to get married; they're just setting conditions. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are also valid, but the author isn't necessarily the one in the wrong here. It's more about whether the girlfriend can accept the prenup as part of the marriage agreement. If she can't, it's a compatibility issue rather than a right or wrong situation.\n"
