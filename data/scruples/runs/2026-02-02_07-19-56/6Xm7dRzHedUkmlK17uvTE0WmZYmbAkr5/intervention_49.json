I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation properly. The user is the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post. They own a business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. Their family's marriages, especially their parents', were full of distrust and conflict. The author has trust issues because of that but is working on them. They don't see marriage as a necessity.\n\nThey had a discussion with their 26-year-old girlfriend (they're 27) about marriage after being together three years and living together for 1.5 years. The author said they're unsure about marriage and if they do, want a prenup. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling them a distrustful asshole and feeling insulted and hurt. The author explained it's about security, not distrust, but she wasn't having it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of a prenuptial agreement. Prenups are legal contracts that outline how assets will be divided if the marriage ends. They're common in many relationships, especially when there's significant property, business, or other assets involved. The author's business is a key asset here, worth protecting. The author isn't saying they don't want to get married; they're just considering a prenup as a precaution. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels the prenup is a sign of distrust. But the author clarifies it's about security, not distrust. However, in the context of the discussion, the girlfriend might feel that even considering a prenup without her agreement is a breach of trust. The author's stance might be seen as prioritizing their financial security over mutual trust in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons: trust issues from family history, a significant business asset, and wanting to protect their hard-earned assets. Prenups can actually promote transparency and mutual agreement on financial matters, which might prevent future conflicts. \n\nBut the issue here is the girlfriend's emotional response. She might feel that the prenup requirement is a deal-breaker for her. The author's right to protect their assets is important, but so is respecting their partner's feelings and expectations. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but they might need to communicate better. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nIn some contexts, wanting a prenup is seen as responsible, especially with significant assets. However, if the girlfriend doesn't want a prenup and the author's stance is non-negotiable, it might create a conflict. The author isn't forcing marriage, just stating their conditions if they do decide to marry. The girlfriend's reaction could indicate that she doesn't want those conditions, which is her right too. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the author is being reasonable and the girlfriend is overreacting, the author isn't in the wrong. If the author is making an unreasonable demand that's causing emotional harm without justification, they might be. But given the author's reasons\u2014trust issues from family, protecting a business\u2014it's a valid concern. The key is that both parties have different expectations, and it's a matter of whether they can find a middle ground or agree to disagree. \n\nSince the author isn't refusing to get married outright but is setting conditions for it, and considering the importance of prenups in such scenarios, I think the author is not in the wrong. The problem is a mismatch in expectations, not necessarily the author being at fault. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
