I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. They provided a detailed scenario where the author explains their reasons, including family background with a troubled marriage, building a business, and trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's reasons for wanting a prenup are personal and rooted in their experiences. Prenups are legal tools that many people use to protect their assets, especially if they own a business. It's a common practice in many relationships to have a prenup to outline financial responsibilities and asset division in case of a divorce.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling insulted and hurt. She might interpret the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. However, the author clarifies that it's about security, not distrust. This is a key point. The author is trying to explain that the prenup is for their own peace of mind, not a reflection on the relationship's trustworthiness.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether their stance is unreasonable. From a legal standpoint, wanting a prenup is entirely reasonable and responsible, especially given the author's financial situation. The fact that they built a business from scratch adds to the importance of protecting that asset. Trust issues in their family might contribute to their desire for security, so it's a personal decision that's hard to fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings of being hurt are valid. Marriage discussions can be emotional, and bringing up a prenup might feel like a practical barrier to the romantic ideal some people have of marriage. But is the author wrong for prioritizing their own security? Probably not. It's a matter of differing expectations. The author isn't being untrustworthy; they're setting boundaries based on their experiences.\n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their request is about personal security and practicality, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are a result of differing views on marriage and commitment, but that doesn't make the author's position incorrect. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
