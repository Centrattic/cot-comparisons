I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The context provided includes the author's background: they have a successful business earning over $150k annually, built from scratch. Their family's marriage history is rocky, with parents who constantly tried to undermine each other, leading to deep trust issues. The author is 27, their girlfriend is 26, and they've been together for three years, living together for a year and a half.\n\nThe conflict arose when discussing marriage. The author expressed uncertainty about marriage and a desire for a prenup if they did get married. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling the author a \"distrustful asshole\" and feeling hurt and insulted. The author tried to explain that it's about personal security, not distrust, but she wasn't receptive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given by the author. They have a valid concern about protecting their business and assets, especially given their family history. Prenups are common for people with significant assets to ensure their financial interests are protected in case of divorce. The author's hesitation towards marriage isn't just about the prenup but also a general view that marriage isn't a necessity for them. They mention trust issues from their parents' marriage, which might affect their willingness to enter into a marriage without safeguards.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt the proposal of a prenup was a personal insult and a sign of distrust. She might have expected marriage to be a trust-based commitment without legal safeguards. It's possible she felt the author wasn't fully committed to the idea of marriage if it required a prenup, which could indicate a lack of faith in the relationship's longevity or her trustworthiness.\n\nLegally, prenups are standard for protecting individual assets. The author isn't the first to request one, especially with substantial personal wealth. The fact that they built the business from the ground up adds weight to their need for protection. However, the emotional aspect here is about how the prenup request was received. The author tried to explain it as a security measure, not distrust, but the girlfriend perceived it as a lack of trust. \n\nIt's important to consider communication styles. The author might have approached the discussion without considering how the request would emotionally affect the girlfriend. Maybe they could have framed the prenup differently, emphasizing protection for both parties rather than just their own assets. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have unrealistic expectations about marriage not involving such legal steps.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no absolute answer here. The author's stance is justifiable from a legal and personal history perspective. However, the way the issue was presented could have been more sensitive to the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, might stem from feeling untrusted or undervalued. Both parties have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup given their circumstances. The key is whether the author had a legitimate reason and whether the girlfriend's reaction was proportionate. Since the author is upfront about their reasons and has a history that supports their need, they might not be in the wrong. However, the situation highlights a mismatch in expectations about marriage and financial security. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to want a prenup is a reasonable precaution, especially with their assets and family background. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional but might reflect her own expectations about marriage. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup, making the answer B.\n"
