I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting a prenup and not being sure about marriage. Their background includes a family with failed marriages and trust issues. They own a successful business. The girlfriend was upset, feeling insulted.\n\nFirst, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a legal document that can protect both parties, especially if one has significant assets. The fact that the author built a business from scratch makes a prenup a reasonable precaution. However, communication is key. The way they introduced the topic might have been a problem. The girlfriend might have felt the prenup was a sign of distrust, even if it's not meant that way. The author mentions trust issues from their family, which could influence their perspective, but they tried to explain it's about security. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she saw it as a personal insult, maybe expecting marriage to be a commitment without financial safeguards. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't unethical. It's about protecting their assets. Maybe the issue is not the prenup itself but how it was communicated. The girlfriend might have felt it undermined the relationship's trust. But the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial security, especially given their background. So, probably the author isn't at fault. Answer B.\n"
