I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a man who owns a successful business and has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage. He proposed the idea of a prenup, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's built a business and wants financial security. His family history with dysfunctional marriages gives him valid reasons to be cautious. A prenup isn't about distrust but about protecting assets, especially if they have different financial backgrounds or if one has significant assets. It's a common practice in many marriages, especially when there are businesses or substantial wealth involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. She might see the prenup as a sign that he doesn't trust her or the relationship. Marriage is often seen as a commitment, and bringing up a prenup can feel like a lack of faith in the relationship's longevity or her intentions. Her emotional reaction is understandable, as it's a sensitive topic that can affect perceived trust and commitment.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Many people use them to protect their interests, especially if they have assets. The key is how the request was communicated. If he approached it as a practical discussion rather than a demand, it might have been received better. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Maybe the issue is more about communication and differing values rather than one person being right or wrong.\n\nCultural and personal values play a role here. Some view prenups as necessary for financial clarity, others as a sign of distrust. The author's transparency about his reasons (family history, trust issues) is important. He's not hiding his motives, which is good. But his girlfriend might value emotional security over financial protection in their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but his approach and the girlfriend's feelings need to be addressed. It's more about differing priorities and communication than a clear right or wrong. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because having a prenup is a personal and practical decision, especially given his circumstances.\n"
