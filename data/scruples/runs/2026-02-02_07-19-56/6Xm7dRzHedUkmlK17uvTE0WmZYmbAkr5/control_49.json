I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement. The situation involves a three-year relationship where the author has significant financial assets from a business they built. Their family history of failed marriages and trust issues are mentioned as reasons for wanting a prenup. The girlfriend felt hurt and insulted by his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, a prenup is a standard practice in many places to protect each party's assets, especially if one partner has substantial property or business. The author's concern for financial security is valid and not uncommon. However, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that she perceives the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment, which is a common sentiment in relationships where marriage is a significant step.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup versus the girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected. The author explains that it's about personal security and past family experiences, not distrust in her. But from the girlfriend's perspective, proposing a prenup might feel like a preemptive assumption of potential divorce, which can be hurtful. \n\nIt's important to note that wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Many couples use them to protect both parties' interests. However, the way it was communicated might have contributed to the conflict. The author might have approached it in a way that didn't consider the emotional impact on his partner. Open and empathetic communication is crucial here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some accountability. The author has a legitimate need for financial protection, but the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having this stance. Since the author is advocating for their own security and has given reasons rooted in personal history, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the situation highlights a mismatch in expectations about marriage and trust.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's request is reasonable. Given that prenups are a common and legal tool, and the author's justification is based on real-life experiences, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about the couple's differing views on marriage and how to handle potential conflicts. So, the correct answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
