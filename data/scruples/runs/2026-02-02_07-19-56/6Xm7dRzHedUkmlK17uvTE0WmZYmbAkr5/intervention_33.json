I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author has a successful business and trust issues from their parents' marriage. They told their girlfriend about wanting a prenup, and she was really upset, calling him a distrustful asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: trust issues from a bad example at home, wanting financial security. A prenup is a practical step to protect their business and assets, especially since they built it from the ground up. They don't see marriage as a necessity, which is their personal choice.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She felt hurt and insulted. Getting a prenup might feel like a lack of trust in the relationship. Marriage proposals without a prenup are common, but the author is upfront about their stance. The problem arises from their differing views on marriage and financial arrangements.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a legal document that can protect both parties. However, the context here is that the author is using it as a condition for marriage. The issue might be communication. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but the girlfriend didn't accept that. \n\nIn relationships, differing values and expectations can cause conflict. The author's stance is based on personal history and financial protection. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, feeling it's a personal attack. Both have valid points. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given their circumstances. It's a reasonable precaution. The real issue might be whether they can reconcile their differing views. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
