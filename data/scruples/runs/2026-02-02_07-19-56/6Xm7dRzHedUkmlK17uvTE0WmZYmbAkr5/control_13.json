I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a successful business and has trust issues due to their parents' failed marriage. They want a prenup if they ever marry, which they view as a financial safeguard. Their girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup. Prenups are legal documents that outline asset division in case of divorce. They are common in many marriages, especially when there are significant assets involved. The author's background explains their caution, stemming from family experiences. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not trusted. However, the author clarifies that the prenup isn't about distrust in her specifically but about personal history and financial protection. \n\nMarriage laws vary by location, but generally, a prenup is a legal tool for both parties to protect their assets. The author's stance isn't uncommon, especially for someone with their financial situation. The girlfriend might have expected a traditional approach, but the author's reasoning is valid. \n\nIt's important to note that wanting a prenup isn't about distrust in the relationship's success but about preparedness. The author isn't refusing marriage; they just want a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author's position is reasonable given their background and assets. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. The answer should be B.\n"
