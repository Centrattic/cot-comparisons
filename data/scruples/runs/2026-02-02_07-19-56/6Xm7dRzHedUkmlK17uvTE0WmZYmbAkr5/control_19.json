I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 27, runs a business making over $150k a year, and has trust issues from their parents' problematic marriage. They mentioned to their girlfriend (26) that if they do get married, they want a prenup. The girlfriend took it as a personal insult and got upset, feeling hurt and disrespected. The author claims it's about security, not distrust in the relationship. The girlfriend doesn't want a prenup at all and thinks the author is a \"distrustful asshole.\"\n\nFirst, prenups are legal agreements that outline asset division in case of divorce. They can be a practical step, especially when one partner has significant assets. The author built their business from scratch, which likely took a lot of time and effort. A prenup might help protect those assets if the marriage ends, which is a common reason people use them. The author isn't outright refusing marriage but wants a prenup, which could be seen as responsible planning rather than distrust.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also important. She might feel that the mention of a prenup implies a lack of faith in the marriage's longevity. In many cultures, marriage is seen as a lifelong commitment, and suggesting a prenup could seem like the author is already planning for the possibility of divorce. The girlfriend's hurt feelings stem from this perception, and her reaction is valid from her perspective. \n\nThe author's trust issues come from their family background, which adds context. They might see a prenup as necessary due to their negative experiences, but the girlfriend may not share those concerns. The conflict here is between the author's need for legal and financial security and the girlfriend's emotional response. \n\nIt's not necessarily the author's fault for wanting a prenup, especially with their financial situation. But the way the request was communicated or the assumption that the girlfriend would understand the reasoning might be where things went wrong. Open communication is key in relationships, and maybe the author should have approached the topic more sensitively, explaining it as a practical measure rather than a sign of distrust. \n\nStill, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as over-the-top. Prenups are common in many relationships, particularly when there are significant assets involved. The author isn't refusing marriage, so maybe the girlfriend is being unreasonable. But her feelings of being insulted and hurt are real, so the author's approach might have been insensitive.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the actions were reasonable and respectful. The author's stance on a prenup is reasonable for protecting their business, but the situation is tricky. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she felt untrusted, but she might need to recognize the author's valid concerns. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's reasoning for the prenup is seen as justified and how their communication affected the relationship. Since the author is proactive about security and the girlfriend is upset about the implication of distrust, it's a balance. However, given the author's background and the nature of prenups, they might not be in the wrong. But the girlfriend's feelings are also important. The question is whether the author is the asshole. If the author is reasonable and the girlfriend is being inflexible, maybe the answer is B. But if the author is being unfair, maybe A. I think the key is that prenups are a matter of financial responsibility, and the author isn't refusing marriage. The girlfriend might need to mature and understand that it's not about distrust but legal protection. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
