I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns a business earning a significant income, built from scratch. They come from a family where marriages were unsuccessful, with parents who constantly tried to undermine each other. This background has led to trust issues for the author. Now, they're in a 3-year relationship, living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author mentioned being unsure about marriage and wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, wanting a prenup is about financial security. Given their background and the success of their business, it's rational to protect their assets. They mention trust issues from their parents' marriage, which isn't about distrust in their current partner but past experiences. The author is trying to be honest about their feelings and financial planning, which is reasonable. Prenups are common in many relationships, especially when there are significant assets involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. She might see the prenup as a lack of trust in the marriage. Emotionally, bringing up a prenup during marriage discussions can be perceived as a red flag, suggesting the author doesn't believe in the marriage's success. However, the author clarified it's about security, not distrust in her. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but maybe she needs to consider the author's past and financial realities.\n\nLegally, prenups are valid and often advised when there are substantial assets. The author isn't wrong for taking steps to protect their business. The issue here is more about communication and differing values. The author is transparent about their stance, which is mature. The girlfriend might need to address her feelings about marriage expectations versus the author's need for financial protection.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both partners should have mutual understanding. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their financial security based on past experiences. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't the asshole for wanting a prenup. It's a matter of differing priorities and expectations. The author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a responsible decision, considering their background and assets. The girlfriend's reaction is a point of conflict, but it doesn't make the author at fault. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
