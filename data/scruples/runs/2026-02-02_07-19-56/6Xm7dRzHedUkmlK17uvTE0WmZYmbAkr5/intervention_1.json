I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author is a 27-year-old with a successful business, earning $150k+ annually. They come from a family where marriages weren't successful, and they have trust issues stemming from their parents' toxic relationship. They proposed the idea of a prenup if they ever got married, which upset their girlfriend. She felt insulted and hurt, interpreting it as a lack of trust, while the author's reasoning is about personal security given their family history.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's stance is based on personal history and financial protection. Prenups are legal documents that outline asset division in case of divorce. They can be a practical way to protect individual assets, especially if one partner has significant assets or a business. The author isn't saying they don't trust their girlfriend; they're addressing their own fears and past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels insulted. Her reaction could stem from feeling that the author doesn't fully commit to the marriage or views the relationship as a potential failure from the start. However, the author's intention isn't to distrust her but to protect their own financial future. \n\nIs it fair to call the author in the wrong? It's a matter of perspective. Legally and financially, prenups are a common-sense approach, especially when there's a history of marital issues. Emotionally, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of commitment, but the author's perspective is about personal security. \n\nThe author is honest about their feelings and background, which is important. They're not trying to hide their stance. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of her feelings, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having different needs based on their experiences. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They are advocating for their own financial security, which is a legitimate concern, especially given their background. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault for having a different perspective.\n"
