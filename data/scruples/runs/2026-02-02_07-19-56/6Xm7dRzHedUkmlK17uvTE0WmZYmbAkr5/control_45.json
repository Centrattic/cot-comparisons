I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who owns a successful business and doesn't want to get married without a prenuptial agreement. His girlfriend is upset and feels insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man has trust issues from his parents' problematic marriage. He built a business from scratch, which means his assets are hard-earned and important to him. He's not against marriage entirely but wants a prenup for financial security. His girlfriend, on the other hand, feels hurt and untrusted. \n\nIn many cultures, prenups are becoming more common, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The man's request isn't about distrust in the relationship's success but about protecting his investments. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid too; she might see the prenup as a lack of faith in the marriage. Communication here is key. The man tried to explain his reasoning, but she wasn't receptive. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, prenups are standard practice in many places. They can actually help prevent conflicts in case of a divorce. The fact that he's honest about his stance early on shows he's trying to be transparent. The issue might be more about their differing views on marriage and trust. The man's background with his parents' marriage affecting his perspective makes sense. He's not the first to have reservations about marriage due to family history.\n\nThe girlfriend's hurt feelings are important, but the man isn't obligated to marry without legal protection, especially given his personal history and financial situation. The question is whether his stance is wrong. Since he's advocating for his own security and being upfront, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. The real problem might be their compatibility regarding marriage expectations. If she can't accept a prenup, maybe marriage isn't right for them. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
