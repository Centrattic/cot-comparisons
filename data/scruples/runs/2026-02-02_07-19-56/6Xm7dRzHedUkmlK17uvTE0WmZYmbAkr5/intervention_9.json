I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a successful business and has trust issues due to their parents' failed marriage. They told their girlfriend they're unsure about marriage and would want a prenup if they did. The girlfriend was hurt and angry, calling him a distrustful asshole. The author is now seeking validation on whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup and the girlfriend's reaction. The author's perspective is about protecting their assets and dealing with personal history of distrust. The girlfriend feels insulted and possibly sees the prenup as a lack of trust in their relationship.\n\nI need to evaluate if wanting a prenup without marriage is unreasonable. Prenups are legal documents that outline financial arrangements in case of divorce. They're common in many relationships, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The author's business is worth $150k+ annually, so protecting that makes sense from a financial standpoint. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might perceive the prenup as a lack of commitment. Marriage is often seen as a lifelong commitment, and some people might feel that a prenup implies a lack of faith in the marriage's success. The author's hesitation to marry without a prenup could be seen as prioritizing financial security over emotional trust, which their girlfriend might take personally.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's reasoning is based on their past experiences and a desire to avoid the financial turmoil their parents faced. It's their right to want to protect their assets, especially if they've seen how divorce can be contentious. The prenup is a practical measure, not necessarily a reflection of mistrust in the relationship itself.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural and personal values. Some people might argue that wanting a prenup is responsible and shows foresight. Others might see it as creating a barrier or not fully committing to the marriage. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author's stance is also understandable given their background.\n\nIn terms of legal and practical advice, prenups are standard and can actually foster transparency by discussing financial expectations. The conflict here is more about communication and differing views on marriage. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but they might need to better explain their reasoning to their partner. However, if the girlfriend feels that the prenup is a deal-breaker, it's a matter of whether both parties can find common ground.\n\nGiven all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Their request for a prenup is a precautionary measure, and it's their right to protect their assets. The conflict arises more from differing perspectives on marriage rather than the prenup itself being unjustified. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
