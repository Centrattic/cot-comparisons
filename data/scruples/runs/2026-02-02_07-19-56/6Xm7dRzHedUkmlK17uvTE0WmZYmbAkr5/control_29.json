I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding wanting a prenup before marriage. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 27-year-old with a successful business making over $150k a year. They come from a family where marriages weren't successful, and their parents had constant conflicts. This background has led to trust issues. They mention they're working on these trust issues but still view marriage not as a necessity. The girlfriend is 26, and they've been together three years, living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author expresses uncertainty about getting married and wanting a prenup if they do. The girlfriend reacts strongly, feeling insulted and hurt. The author tried to explain it's about personal security, but she didn't accept it.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the author is wrong for wanting a prenup. Prenups are legal agreements that outline the division of assets in case of divorce. They can be seen as practical, especially when one partner has significant assets or a business. The author's reasons are based on their family history and personal experiences with trust. It's not about distrust of the girlfriend specifically, but more about protecting their own interests given their background and what they've seen.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted, which is a valid reaction. Marriage is often viewed as a union of trust and commitment, so suggesting a prenup might be perceived as a lack of faith in the marriage's longevity or in the partner's intentions. However, the author is upfront about their stance and is honest about their motivations.\n\nThe key points here are the author's justification for wanting a prenup (family history, trust issues, business assets) and the girlfriend's emotional reaction. Whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on perspective. Legally and practically, having a prenup is a responsible decision, especially with significant assets. Emotionally, it's about how the request is communicated and perceived. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend might see it as a red flag. \n\nIn terms of moral or social wrong, it's subjective. Some might argue that wanting a prenup is prudent and not a reflection of distrust in the relationship, while others might see it as undermining the trust that marriage is supposed to represent. The author isn't forcing the issue but is sharing their stance, which is part of their values. The girlfriend's reaction is her own, and whether the author is at fault depends on whose perspective you take. \n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No) because the author is acting in their own interest based on their experiences and assets, and the prenup is a common legal tool. The girlfriend's hurt feelings don't necessarily make the author wrong; it's a matter of differing expectations and values.\n"
