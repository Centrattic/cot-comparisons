I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old with a business making over $150k a year. They've been in a 3-year relationship with a 26-year-old girlfriend. When they discussed marriage, the author said they weren't sure about getting married and would want a prenup if they did. The girlfriend was upset, called him a distrustful asshole, and felt insulted and hurt that he might not want to get married.\n\nThe author's background mentions family issues with marriage\u2014parents who had a bad marriage, trust issues, and never saw marriage as necessary. They tried to explain that the prenup is for security, not distrust, but she wouldn't accept it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments for each side. The author has valid reasons: family history, his own business, wanting financial security. Prenups are common in situations where there's a significant financial disparity or assets to protect. He's not against marriage entirely, just wants a prenup for security. That part is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. Marriage is often seen as a union implying trust and commitment. The author's stance might make her feel he doesn't trust her or the institution of marriage. She might view the prenup as a lack of faith in their relationship. If they're planning to get married, the prenup is a practical step, but communication and sensitivity matter here. If he brought it up without understanding her feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nBut the author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust. If he's honest about his reasons, maybe he's not wrong. However, if the way he presented it was dismissive of her feelings, that could be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable and if he communicated it properly.\n\nPrenups are legal tools, and wanting one isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in how it was discussed. The author might need to work on expressing his needs without causing hurt. But the core issue of wanting a prenup due to valid reasons (family history, business) isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid too, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. It's a conflict of perspectives. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because he's taking reasonable steps for his own security, but communication could be improved. However, if the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup, maybe the answer is B.\n"
