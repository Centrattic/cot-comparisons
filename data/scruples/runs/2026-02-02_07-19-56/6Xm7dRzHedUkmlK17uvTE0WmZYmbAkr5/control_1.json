I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves him not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author owns a successful business and has trust issues due to his parents' failed marriage. He's discussing marriage with his girlfriend, and when he mentions wanting a prenup, she gets upset, feeling insulted. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, the main points: He's concerned about protecting his assets, especially since he built his business from scratch. His background with his parents' marriage might make him wary of financial entanglements without legal protection. The girlfriend is hurt and feels the prenup is a sign of distrust.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, prenups are common and can be a responsible way to protect individual assets. The author is not necessarily being distrustful; he's looking to safeguard his business. However, the way he presented it might have come across as distrustful, especially if his communication wasn't clear. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels the prenup is unnecessary or an insult, which might stem from her own expectations about marriage as a commitment without such legal safeguards.\n\nBut is he wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might argue that wanting a prenup is practical, especially given his financial situation and history. Others might think that if you're getting married, a prenup could imply a lack of trust in the relationship. However, the author is also being honest about his needs and concerns, which is important in a relationship. The key here is whether his request is reasonable and if he communicated it properly. Since he explained it's about his own security and not distrust, but she still took it the wrong way, it's possible the issue isn't about being wrong but about differing expectations. \n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing big steps like marriage, differing priorities can lead to conflict. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given his background. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author's stance is about protecting his assets. It's a matter of balancing personal values and communication. Without more context on how he approached the conversation, it's hard to say if he's entirely at fault. But generally, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
