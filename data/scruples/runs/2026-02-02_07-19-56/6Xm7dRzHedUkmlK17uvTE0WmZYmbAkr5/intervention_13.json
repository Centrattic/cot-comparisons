I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author has a successful business, trust issues from his parents' failed marriage, and proposed a prenup when discussing marriage with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is based on his personal experiences and financial security. He's built a business, so protecting his assets makes sense. Prenups are legal tools to outline financial arrangements in case of divorce, which can prevent conflicts later. His trust issues from his family's example might make him cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. Marriage is a big commitment, and for some people, a prenup might feel like a lack of trust or a sign that the author doesn't believe the marriage will last. It could be perceived as prioritizing financial security over emotional commitment, which can be emotionally hurtful.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step for asset protection, especially when one partner has significant assets. However, how he communicated it might matter. If he approached it as a necessary step for his peace of mind and explained it clearly, that's different from dismissing her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might see marriage as a symbol of trust and commitment, and a prenup could be seen as contradicting that. But the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his assets. It's a matter of differing values and expectations. \n\nSo, the answer probably hinges on whether wanting a prenup is a dealbreaker for the relationship. If both can agree on terms and mutual respect, then it's not the author's fault. But if the girlfriend can't accept it, then it's a compatibility issue rather than a moral wrong. The author is being pragmatic, while the girlfriend is emotional. Neither is entirely right or wrong; it's a conflict in perspectives. The key is that the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but he might need to better address his partner's feelings. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
