I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author owns a successful business and has a significant income. Their family background includes parents with a troubled marriage, leading to trust issues. They mention discussing marriage with their girlfriend, and when they brought up the idea of a prenup, the girlfriend was upset, calling them a distrustful asshole and feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's desire for a prenup due to personal experiences and financial security versus the girlfriend's emotional reaction. The author argues it's about security and trust issues from their past, not distrust of the current partner. The girlfriend feels it's an insult and a sign of not wanting to commit to marriage.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, prenups are common and often recommended, especially when both parties have significant assets. The author's business and income make a prenup a prudent financial decision. The author isn't avoiding marriage but wants to protect their assets, which is a reasonable stance. However, communication is key here. Maybe the author didn't explain their reasons well enough, leading to the girlfriend feeling hurt. But the intention isn't to distrust her, just to protect themselves, which is different from general distrust in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the prenup implies a lack of trust in the marriage. However, the author clarifies it's about their past and personal security, not her. In relationships, differing views on marriage and financial planning can lead to conflicts. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on intent and communication. Since the author is transparent about their past and financial reasons, and the prenup is a standard legal instrument, it's not inherently wrong to request one. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing financial security based on their history. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
