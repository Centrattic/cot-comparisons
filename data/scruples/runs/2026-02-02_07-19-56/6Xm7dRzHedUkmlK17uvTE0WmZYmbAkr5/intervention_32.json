I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has a successful business and trust issues from their parents' failed marriage. They propose a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt by the suggestion of a prenup and the hesitation to marry.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a legal document that can protect both parties, especially when there's significant assets involved. The author built a business worth $150k+, so financial protection is a valid concern. They also mention their family history, which explains their caution.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the prenup request implies a lack of trust. But the author clarifies it's about security, not distrust. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, which is common in such situations. But does that make the author wrong? Maybe not. It's about differing expectations and communication. The author is being honest about their needs and fears. If the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe the issue is more about compatibility than right or wrong. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
