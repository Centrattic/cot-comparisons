I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old person who owns a business earning over $150k a year. They built it from scratch. Their family has a history of failed marriages, especially their parents, who had constant conflicts and tried to take advantage of each other. The author has trust issues because of this. They mention that they've been working on these trust issues.\n\nNow, they're in a 3-year relationship with a 26-year-old girlfriend. They've been living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author tells her they're unsure about getting married and, if they do, want a prenuptial agreement. The girlfriend reacts strongly, calling the author a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt and insulted. The author tried to explain that it's about personal security, not distrust, but she won't hear it. The author is asking if they're at fault (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. They have a business and significant assets. They come from a family where trust was broken in marriage. They have trust issues as a result. They want a prenup for financial security. They're being honest about their feelings towards marriage, not being sure they want it. Their reasoning is about protecting their assets, not distrust of their partner. They tried to explain this but the girlfriend felt insulted.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was hurt by the mention of a prenup and the author's hesitation about marriage. She might see the prenup as a lack of trust in their relationship's future, implying that the author doesn't believe in the marriage's success. The idea that marriage is a commitment, and bringing up a prenup might feel like they're already anticipating problems.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author was upfront about their feelings and concerns. The fact that they have trust issues from their family background could be a valid reason for wanting a prenup. However, the girlfriend's reaction shows that the way the topic was approached might have been hurtful. The author might have not considered how the prenup request would be received emotionally, even if it's for practical reasons.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting a prenup? Legally, prenups are common and can be a responsible way to protect individual assets, especially when one partner has significant property. The author's hesitation about marriage itself might not be the issue, but the girlfriend interprets it as a lack of commitment.\n\nThe author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but the girlfriend still felt insulted. That suggests there's a miscommunication or differing views on how to approach marriage. The author's perspective is practical and influenced by past family issues; the girlfriend's is emotional and possibly seeing the prenup as a lack of trust.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't legally or morally wrong for wanting a prenup. It's a reasonable step for someone with assets. However, the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not whether the communication was effective.\n\nSo, considering that wanting a prenup is a valid decision and the author is honest about their feelings, they might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid in that she feels hurt, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's more about differing expectations and values. Since the author isn't doing something unethical or illegal, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
