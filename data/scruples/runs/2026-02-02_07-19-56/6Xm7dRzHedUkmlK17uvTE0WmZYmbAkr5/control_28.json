I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not wanting to get married without a prenup makes them the \"asshole\" in the situation. \n\nFirst, the user's background: they own a successful business earning over $150k, built from scratch. Their family's marriages weren't good examples, especially their parents who had constant issues. They have trust problems but are working on them. They don't see marriage as necessary. \n\nWhen talking about marriage with their girlfriend, the author expressed uncertainty about marriage and the desire for a prenup if they did get married. The girlfriend was upset, called them a distrustful asshole, felt insulted and hurt. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but she wouldn't listen.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup. Prenups are legal documents that outline asset division in case of divorce. They can be about protecting individual assets, especially if one partner has significant property or a business. The author's background with parents' problematic marriage might make them cautious. Also, they have trust issues, which could influence their need for a prenup as a safeguard, not necessarily distrust of their partner.\n\nBut the girlfriend perceived it as distrust. The author tried to explain it's for security, but she was hurt. Is the author wrong for wanting a prenup? Well, in many places, prenups are legal and common, especially in cases where there's a business involved. It's a practical step to protect assets, not an indication of distrust towards the current partner. However, the way the author communicated this might be an issue. If they presented it without considering how it might be received, that could cause hurt feelings. But the core request for a prenup is a reasonable precaution.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own expectations or values about marriage. Some people view prenups as a lack of commitment or trust. The author's stance is about self-protection based on their experiences and financial situation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup. The conflict arises from differing views on marriage and security. The author's reasons are valid, so they're not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
