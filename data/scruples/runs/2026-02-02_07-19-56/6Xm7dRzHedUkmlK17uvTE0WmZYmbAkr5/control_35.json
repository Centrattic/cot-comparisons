I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a couple discussing marriage after three years together. The author has a successful business and has trust issues due to his parents' unsuccessful marriage. He wants a prenup if he ever gets married, but his girlfriend took it as a personal insult, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup. He's citing his business success, family history of marital conflict, and trust issues. Prenups are legal documents that outline the division of assets in case of divorce. They're often used to protect individual assets, especially when one or both partners have significant property or businesses. So from a legal standpoint, wanting a prenup is a reasonable precaution. It's not about distrust in the relationship necessarily but about protecting financial interests.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling hurt and insulted, interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust. This is a common emotional response. People might see a prenup as a sign that the other person doesn't believe in the marriage's longevity or their commitment. However, the author is clear that his motivation is about security, not distrust. He's trying to work on his trust issues, so he's aware of his own emotional baggage here.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the couple is discussing marriage and one partner wants a prenup, it's a practical step, especially given the author's financial situation. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't the one at fault for wanting to protect his assets. Marriage planning should involve open communication about financial expectations. The fact that the author addressed it upfront shows responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from unmet emotional expectations, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his financial security based on his life experiences.\n\nAlso, considering that the author is working on his trust issues, he's making an effort to address past trauma, which is commendable. The prenup is a way to mitigate risks from his family's history, not a reflection of his current relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for having realistic financial safeguards in place. The conflict here is more about differing emotional needs and expectations rather than the author being inherently in the wrong.\n"
