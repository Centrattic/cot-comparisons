I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, the author explains his background: he owns a successful business, has trust issues due to his parents' failed marriage, and views marriage as unnecessary. He mentioned wanting a prenup if he ever gets married. His girlfriend got upset, feeling insulted and hurt, thinking it's a sign of distrust. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author is upfront about his feelings towards marriage and his financial situation. He's not against marriage entirely but has valid reasons for wanting a prenup\u2014protecting his assets, especially since he built a business. Prenups are common in many relationships, especially when there's significant wealth involved. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from emotional hurt, possibly feeling that the prenup implies a lack of trust. However, the author clarifies that it's about security, not distrust. \n\nMarriage is a legal and financial commitment, and a prenup is a practical document that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. It's not inherently a sign of distrust but rather a way to protect individual interests. The author's stance is reasonable, given his background and financial status. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her emotional response to the idea of marriage being less than ideal, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his security. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both parties should have discussed their expectations early on. The author did express his views, and the girlfriend's reaction is valid in that she might value a more traditional view of marriage without legal safeguards. However, the author isn't in the wrong for having these concerns. It's a matter of differing values and priorities, not necessarily wrongdoing on either side. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
