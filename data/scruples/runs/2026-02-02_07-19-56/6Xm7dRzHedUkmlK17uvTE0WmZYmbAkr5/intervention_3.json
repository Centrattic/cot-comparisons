I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, the author has a successful business and a high income. They come from a family where the parents' marriage was toxic, with constant conflict and mistrust. This has led to deep-seated trust issues. They explain that marriage isn't a necessity for them. When discussing marriage with their girlfriend, they mentioned wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend reacted negatively, feeling insulted and hurt, interpreting it as a lack of trust.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a legal and financial perspective, prenups are standard practice, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The author's stance is about financial security, not distrust. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, taking it as a personal affront. \n\nHowever, the author's background with a troubled family might influence their perspective. They are prioritizing their financial stability, which is a reasonable consideration. The girlfriend may have different expectations about marriage, perhaps viewing a prenup as unnecessary or distrustful. \n\nIt's important to consider both parties' viewpoints. The author is not refusing marriage but wants a prenup. The girlfriend's hurt feelings stem from feeling disrespected. But whether that makes the author the asshole is debatable. \n\nIn many cases, people in similar situations have valid reasons for wanting a prenup. The key is mutual understanding. If the author communicated their reasons clearly and the girlfriend still feels insulted, maybe the issue is more about their differing values and expectations. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making a personal decision based on their experiences and financial situation. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's position is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
