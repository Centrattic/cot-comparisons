I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a 3-year relationship with a girlfriend, and they've discussed marriage. He made it clear he's unsure about marriage and would want a prenup if they do get married. His reasoning includes his family's history of failed marriages, his own trust issues, and building a successful business. His girlfriend reacted negatively, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nNow, the core of the question is whether not wanting a prenup-free marriage makes him an asshole. Let's break it down. A prenup is a legal document that outlines each partner's financial rights and obligations in the event of a divorce or death. It's common in many relationships, especially when there are significant assets involved. The author has a business and earns $150k+, so protecting his assets makes sense. \n\nHis reasons for wanting a prenup aren't about distrust in the relationship itself but based on past experiences with his parents. He's working on trust issues, which shows self-awareness. On the other hand, his girlfriend is upset because she feels hurt and insulted. She might see the prenup as a lack of commitment or trust in their future together. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to explain his stance, but she wasn't receptive. Whether he's in the wrong depends on cultural, legal, and personal values. In many places, prenups are seen as practical and responsible, especially when there are assets to protect. However, some people view marriage as a lifelong commitment without the need for such agreements, leading to emotional hurt when it's suggested.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing in wanting a prenup. The issue is more about the emotional impact and expectations in the relationship. The author's position is understandable given his background. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she feels that the prenup request undermines the trust and emotional commitment she expects from marriage. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? If we consider legal and practical aspects, he's not in the wrong. If we focus on the emotional impact and the girlfriend's feelings, there's a case that he might be seen as insensitive. However, given that he communicated his reasons and the prenup is a common precaution, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. The key here is the mutual understanding and negotiation in the relationship. If the girlfriend can't accept a prenup, it might indicate a fundamental difference in their views on marriage that they need to resolve. But the act of wanting a prenup itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
