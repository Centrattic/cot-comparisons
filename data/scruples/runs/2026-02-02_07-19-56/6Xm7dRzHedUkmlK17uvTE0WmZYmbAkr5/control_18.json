I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a guy who has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage and is now in a relationship where marriage is being discussed.\n\nFirst, the guy has built a successful business, which might mean he's concerned about protecting his assets. His family history with trust issues and bad marriage examples probably influences his need for a prenup. He's being honest about his feelings towards marriage, maybe not wanting it at all, and definitely wanting a prenup if they do get married.\n\nHis girlfriend of three years is hurt by his stance, feeling insulted and seeing it as distrust. She might value marriage as a commitment without legal barriers, and the prenup request seems to undermine her trust in their future. The guy is trying to explain it's about his past and security, not her personally, but she's not receptive.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is he in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup is a practical step for asset protection, especially with his background. It's legal and common in some cases. However, his approach might have come off as dismissive of her feelings. But given his reasons, it's not necessarily wrong. The key here is whether his reasons are valid and if his stance is unreasonable. Since he's transparent and it's based on his experiences, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
