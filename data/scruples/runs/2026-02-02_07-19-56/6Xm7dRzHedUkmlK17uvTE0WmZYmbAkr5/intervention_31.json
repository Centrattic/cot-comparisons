I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, the author owns a business making $150k+ and built it from scratch. Their family's marriages were bad, with trust issues. They've been with their girlfriend for three years and living together for 1.5 years. When they mentioned not being sure about marriage and wanting a prenup, the girlfriend got upset, calling them a distrustful asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nMarriage is a big step, and prenups are about protecting assets, especially if one partner has significant assets. The author's stance is about personal security, given their family history. The girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling insulted and hurt. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Many people do it for financial protection. The author's background with family issues might influence their decision. However, maybe the way they presented it hurt the girlfriend's feelings. They might have been abrupt or not communicated it better. But the girlfriend's reaction is also strong; she felt insulted, which could indicate she had different expectations about marriage. \n\nThe key is whether the author is wrong for wanting a prenup. Legally and financially, it's a reasonable step. Emotionally, maybe the author could have handled the conversation more sensitively. But the core issue is the prenup itself. Since the author is justified in wanting to protect their assets, maybe they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
