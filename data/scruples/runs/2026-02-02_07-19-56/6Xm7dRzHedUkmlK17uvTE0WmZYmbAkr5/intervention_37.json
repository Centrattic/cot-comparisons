I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author owns a successful business earning $150k+, built from scratch. Their family's marriages weren't successful, leading to trust issues. They've been with their girlfriend for three years, living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author says they're unsure about marriage and want a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt, calling the author a distrustful asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. A prenup is a legal contract that outlines the financial and property arrangements in case of divorce or death. People have different views on marriage and prenups. Some see prenups as practical, especially if one partner has significant assets. Others see them as distrustful, implying that the person doesn't trust the partner or expects the marriage to fail.\n\nIn this case, the author has a business worth a lot, and their family history has problematic marriages. Their reasons for wanting a prenup are about protecting their assets, not necessarily a lack of trust in their current partner. They mention trust issues from family but are working on them. The girlfriend, however, interprets the prenup suggestion as a lack of trust and a rejection of marriage itself.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal values. In some cultures, prenups are common and seen as smart. In others, they might be viewed as cynical or distrustful. The girlfriend's hurt feelings might stem from not wanting to think about divorce, which could be a normal reaction but also a point where communication breaks down.\n\nAlso, the author's stance isn't about not wanting marriage at all; they're open to it but with a prenup. The girlfriend, however, seems to equate the prenup with a lack of commitment or trust. It's a mismatch in expectations.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting a prenup? Arguably not, because they're protecting their assets, especially given their background. But if the girlfriend doesn't want to discuss it and feels hurt, then maybe the author should be more sensitive. However, the author's position is based on their life experiences and financial reality. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid in terms of her feelings, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for having different priorities.\n\nAnother angle: marriage is a legal contract itself. A prenup is an extension of that. Some people prioritize financial security, especially when they have assets. The author's background with unstable family marriages might make them more cautious. It's their right to set boundaries, even if it upsets the partner.\n\nBut maybe the issue is communication. The author tried to explain it's not about distrust but about security, but the girlfriend didn't accept it. However, the author isn't the one being unreasonable here. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's stance is practical. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having this position, not necessarily about the communication.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for wanting a prenup, and it's their right to protect their assets. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't wrong for having different expectations. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
