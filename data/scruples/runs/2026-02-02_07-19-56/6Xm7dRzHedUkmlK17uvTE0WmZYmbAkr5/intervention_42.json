I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author has a successful business and comes from a family where marriages weren't stable, leading to trust issues. When they mentioned wanting a prenup if they ever got married, the girlfriend was upset, claiming it made her feel insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they have built a business and have family history that makes them wary of marriage. They want a prenup for their own security, which they explain is about protecting themselves, not distrust. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust and the author's hesitation to marry as a rejection.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But from a rational standpoint, wanting a prenup isn't inherently distrustful. It's more about legal and financial protection, which is common in many relationships, especially when there are significant assets involved. The author is being honest about their stance, which is important in a long-term relationship. However, the way the author communicates their desire for a prenup might have come off as cold or dismissive, especially if the girlfriend was expecting a more straightforward commitment to marriage without such conditions. The author's family issues and business ownership are valid reasons for seeking a prenup, but they might need to approach the conversation more empathetically to address the girlfriend's feelings of being insulted. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid too because marriage is a big step and people might feel that a prenup introduces a level of formality or division that conflicts with the romantic ideal. But it's also about the author's right to set boundaries based on their experiences. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but maybe in how they presented it. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication style, the core issue is the author's stance on marriage and prenups. \n\nPrenups are about planning for potential future scenarios, not doubting the current relationship. So legally, it's a reasonable precaution. Emotionally, it's a matter of perspective. The author's position is based on personal history and practicality, which are legitimate. The girlfriend's hurt feelings stem from her own expectations. It's a conflict between practicality and romantic ideals. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. The misunderstanding here is more about differing values and how to approach them in the relationship. The author is prioritizing their own security, which is their right. The girlfriend's reaction is her response to that, but the author's choice isn't inherently wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
