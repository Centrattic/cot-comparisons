I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, the author runs a business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. Their family's marriages weren't successful, especially their parents, which led to trust issues. They've been with their girlfriend for three years, living together for a year and a half. When discussing marriage, the author mentions not being sure about marriage and wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend took offense, feeling insulted and hurt, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. A prenup can protect both parties, especially if one has significant assets. The author's background with family issues might justify their caution. However, the way it was communicated could be a problem. The girlfriend might feel that the prenup request undermines trust or commitment. But the author explains it's about security, not distrust. \n\nIn many cases, prenups are becoming more common and are seen as practical. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Given their business and family history, it's a valid concern. The girlfriend's reaction is also understandable; people might feel hurt if they perceive a lack of trust. But the author isn't refusing marriage, just wanting a prenup for security. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting a prenup. The issue might be more about communication and mutual understanding. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
