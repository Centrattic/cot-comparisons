I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author (27) not wanting to get married without a prenup, leading to a conflict with his girlfriend (26). They've been together three years and live together for 1.5 years.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author has a successful business earning $150k+, built from scratch. His family's marriages were unsuccessful, with trust issues. He has deep-seated trust issues from that, which he's working on. He doesn't see marriage as a necessity. When discussing marriage, he mentioned wanting a prenup if they do get married, which upset the girlfriend. She felt insulted and hurt, interpreting it as distrust. The author tried to explain it's about personal security, but she wouldn't accept it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around prenups, expectations in relationships, and communication. In many places, prenups are becoming more common and are seen as a practical step, especially when there's significant personal assets involved. The author has a business, so financial protection is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend felt personally attacked, which suggests communication might be an issue. The author tried to explain it's not about her but his own security, but maybe the way he approached it was hurtful. \n\nBut does that mean he's in the wrong? If he's honest about his needs and values, even if it causes discomfort, he might not be at fault. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from her own expectations. Maybe she assumed marriage without a prenup is the norm and didn't consider his history. However, the author's explanation about trust issues and family background is valid context. \n\nThe question is whether not wanting to get married without a prenup, given his circumstances, is wrong. From a legal and practical standpoint, prenups are reasonable. Emotionally, if the communication was clear and respectful, then the issue is on the girlfriend's side. If the author didn't communicate properly, maybe he's at fault. But the post says he tried to explain it's about security, so maybe the problem is her reaction. \n\nIn many cases, differing values on marriage and prenups can lead to conflict. If both partners can't meet halfway, it might be a deal-breaker. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether his stance is unreasonable. Given his business and family history, his request is understandable. The girlfriend might need to work on understanding his perspective. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons for wanting a prenup, and the conflict arises from differing expectations rather than inherent wrongdoing on his part.\n"
