I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a successful business and comes from a family with a troubled marriage. They have trust issues because of their parents' example. They told their girlfriend that if they got married, they would want a prenup. The girlfriend was hurt and called him a distrustful asshole. Now the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, wanting a prenup isn't inherently negative. It's a legal document that can protect each party's assets, especially if one partner has significant property or a business. The author is being cautious, which is reasonable given their background. Marriage can have financial implications, and a prenup is a way to manage that risk. Legally, it's a common practice, especially in cases where one partner has more assets.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. She might see the prenup as a lack of trust in the relationship. In some contexts, bringing up a prenup can be perceived as not fully committing to the marriage, because it's preparing for a potential divorce. The emotional reaction is valid; trust and security in a relationship are important, and the way the author presented the prenup request might have been hurtful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on personal history and financial security. However, communication is key here. If the author had discussed the prenup in a more sensitive way, maybe explaining it's for protection rather than distrust, the reaction might have been different. But the author did try to explain it's about security and their family background. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling undervalued or worried about the future of their relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step. However, the emotional impact on the partner is significant. The girlfriend's feelings of being insulted and hurt are valid. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but there's a communication issue. The problem isn't the prenup itself but how it was introduced and the partner's feelings about it. \n\nIn many cases, couples discuss prenups before marriage without it being a red flag. The issue here might be more about the couple's readiness to have that conversation and whether they align on their views of marriage. If the girlfriend sees marriage as a lifelong commitment without legal protections, and the author needs legal protections, there's a fundamental difference in their approach to marriage. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally and practically, the prenup request is understandable. Emotionally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but the situation highlights a mismatch in their expectations for marriage. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's reasoning is based on personal experience and financial protection, which are valid. However, the way it was handled and the impact on the relationship is a point to consider. But the question is whether the author is technically in the wrong, not just whether there's a problem in the relationship. \n"
