I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a disagreement about marriage and a prenuptial agreement. The user is asking if they are at fault for not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, the background: the author has a successful business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. Their family's marriages were problematic, leading to trust issues. They've been in a 3-year relationship, living together for 1.5 years. When they mentioned not being sure about marriage and wanting a prenup if they did, their girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nSo, the main points are the author's desire for a prenup and hesitation about marriage. Is this unreasonable? Prenups are legal documents that outline the division of assets in case of divorce. They can protect individual assets, especially in cases where one partner has significant property or a business. The author's family history with distrustful marriages might make them wary, and they're trying to approach marriage with caution based on their experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted. That's a common reaction because some people view a prenup as a lack of trust or a sign that the marriage might not last. However, the author's reasoning is about personal security, not distrust of their partner. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable given their circumstances.\n\nIn many cases, prenups are seen as practical, especially when there's a significant disparity in assets or when one partner has children from a previous relationship. The author's business and personal history could justify wanting a prenup. However, the way the issue was presented might have been hurtful. The author tried to explain it's about security, but the girlfriend didn't accept that explanation, indicating a communication breakdown.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that wanting a prenup is a reasonable precaution, especially given their background and assets, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author's hesitation about marriage itself is causing the girlfriend distress, then there might be a different perspective. But the author's reluctance isn't about not trusting the girlfriend personally; it's more about their family history and personal security.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because seeking a prenup is a common and understandable precaution for someone with significant assets and a history of problematic family relationships. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling untrusted, but the author's position is based on personal experience and financial protection, which is valid.\n"
