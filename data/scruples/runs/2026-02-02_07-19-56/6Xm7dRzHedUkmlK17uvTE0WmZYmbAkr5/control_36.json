I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a guy who owns a successful business, has trust issues due to his parents' failed marriage, and is considering a prenup if he ever marries. His girlfriend is upset by his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. Prenups are common and often seen as prudent, especially for people with assets. The guy is protecting his business, which he built himself. From a legal standpoint, wanting a prenup isn't unreasonable. It's a way to outline financial expectations and protect personal assets, which can prevent conflicts later.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. She might see the prenup as a lack of trust. But the guy clarified it's about security, not distrust. Trust issues from his family background are mentioned, which adds context. He's working on those issues, so maybe he's being honest about his past affecting his decisions.\n\nCommunication is key here. The guy brought up the topic, which is important. But maybe the way he presented it was off. Did he express his reasons clearly enough? He tried to explain it's about security, but she didn't accept it. Maybe there's a disconnect in their expectations about marriage. She might view marriage as a symbol of complete trust and commitment, while he sees it as a legal contract that needs safeguards.\n\nCultural and personal values play a role. Some people see prenups as necessary, others as unromantic. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from different values. The guy's position isn't wrong legally or financially, but it's causing emotional strain. The question is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his security over her feelings.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether having a prenup is reasonable. Since it's a legitimate legal tool and his reasons are valid (protecting assets due to personal history), he's not in the wrong. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not his decision itself. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
