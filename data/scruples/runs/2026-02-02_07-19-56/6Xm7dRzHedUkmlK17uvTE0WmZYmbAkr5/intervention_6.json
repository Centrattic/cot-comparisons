I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author owns a business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. They have trust issues stemming from their parents' problematic marriage. They're in a 3-year relationship with their girlfriend, and when they mentioned wanting a prenup if they ever got married, the girlfriend was hurt and called him a distrustful asshole. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's stance on marriage (not seeing it as necessary) and the prenup. The girlfriend is upset because she feels insulted. The author argues it's about security, not distrust. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal and relationship advice, prenups are common, especially when one partner has significant assets. They are meant to protect both parties in case of a divorce, not necessarily to show distrust. However, in relationships, emotions can run high when discussing such matters. The girlfriend might feel that suggesting a prenup implies a lack of trust or commitment, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons: trust issues from family history, business assets to protect. It's reasonable to consider a prenup to safeguard their financial future. The problem might be communication. The author tried to explain it's about security, but the girlfriend didn't take it well. Maybe the author should have approached the conversation differently, with more sensitivity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a legal tool used by many couples. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her feelings than the actual request. However, the way the author presented the idea could have been better. The author's stance isn't unethical or legally wrong, but maybe the approach could have been more considerate. Since the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" it's more about social expectations than legal or ethical standards. If the author is honest and the request is fair, they're not in the wrong. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't the asshole for wanting a prenup. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
