I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author built a business earning $150k+ a year. They come from a family with unsuccessful marriages, where their parents frequently tried to undermine each other. This background has led to trust issues, and they don't see marriage as a necessity. After discussing marriage with their girlfriend, the author expressed wanting a prenup if they did get married. The girlfriend was hurt and called the author a distrustful asshole. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and practical aspects of prenups. A prenup is a legally binding contract that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. It's common in many places, especially when one or both partners have significant assets, businesses, or children from previous relationships. The author has a business, so a prenup would protect that in case of divorce, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nNow, the emotional aspect. The girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, interpreting the prenup request as a lack of trust. Marriages are often seen as a union of trust, so suggesting a prenup can feel like not having trust in the relationship. However, the author explains that it's about personal security, not distrust in the relationship. They mention family history contributing to their cautious approach.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, prenups are more accepted, while in others, they might be viewed negatively. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by such societal expectations. The author's background with family issues might justify their desire for a prenup as a protective measure.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting a prenup? Legally and practically, no. It's a reasonable step to protect assets. Emotionally, it's about communication. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend didn't accept it. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for having a valid reason and seeking legal protection. Since they're not doing it out of distrust towards the girlfriend specifically but based on past experiences and asset protection, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings being hurt is a valid reaction. The author's approach might need to be more sensitive. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about who's more hurt. The author's actions are justified from a legal and personal history standpoint. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
