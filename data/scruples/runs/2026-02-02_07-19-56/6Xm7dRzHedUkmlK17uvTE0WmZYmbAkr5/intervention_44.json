I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author owns a successful business, has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage, and wants a prenup if they do get married. His girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about financial security and past trauma. He's not against marriage but wants a prenup for protection. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the prenup is a sign of lack of trust, even if he says it's about security. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Legally, a prenup is a valid and common practice, especially when one partner has significant assets. It's not inherently wrong to want one to protect their business. However, communication is key here. The author tried to explain his reasons, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not feel heard or respected. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the prenup is a reasonable precaution and he's being transparent, then he might not be in the wrong. But if the way he presented it was hurtful or dismissive of her feelings, maybe there's room for improvement. However, the core issue is his right to have a prenup, which is a personal decision. \n\nSo, considering that financial protection is a legitimate concern and the prenup isn't about distrust but security, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But if the execution of the conversation was poor, that's a different matter. The question is about being in the wrong, not about communication skills. Since the request for a prenup is valid, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
