I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. They provided their own opinion that the author is in the wrong but want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author owns a successful business and comes from a family with troubled marriage experiences. They have trust issues due to their parents' behavior. They mentioned not seeing marriage as a necessity but considering a prenup if they do get married. Their girlfriend got upset, feeling insulted and hurt. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but she wasn't receptive.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations in a relationship. Marriage is a big step, and prenups are legal agreements that outline financial arrangements in case of divorce. The author's stance is about protecting their assets, especially since they built their business from scratch. Their background with parents who had a contentious relationship might influence their desire for a prenup to avoid similar issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she may view the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. In many relationships, marriage is seen as a union where both partners are committed to each other long-term, and a prenup can sometimes be perceived as planning for the worst rather than trusting each other. The author's hesitation to marry without a prenup might be seen as prioritizing their own security over the emotional aspect of the relationship, which could be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is practical. They have significant assets to protect, and a prenup can provide clarity and security for both parties. The fact that they built their business from the ground up shows they value hard work and may want to ensure that their efforts aren't compromised in case the marriage doesn't work out. Their trust issues stem from family history, which is a valid reason for seeking a prenup as a precaution.\n\nThe girlfriend's hurt feelings are understandable if she interprets the prenup as a lack of faith in the relationship. But the author is clear that it's about security, not distrust. The problem arises when the communication isn't effective. The author tried to explain their perspective, but the girlfriend didn't accept it, which might indicate a deeper issue in their communication or differing values regarding marriage and financial matters.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for wanting a prenup, as it's a common practice for people with substantial assets. However, if the girlfriend sees it as a breach of trust, the author might need to address that perception. The key here is mutual understanding and compromise. If both parties can't find common ground, it might lead to conflict. The author's position is justified from a practical standpoint, but the emotional impact on the girlfriend shouldn't be ignored. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions are seen as reasonable given their circumstances. Since the author is being transparent about their needs and the prenup serves a practical purpose, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the prenup is causing significant emotional distress without a valid reason, that could tip the scale. Here, the author has valid reasons rooted in their background and financial situation, so the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
