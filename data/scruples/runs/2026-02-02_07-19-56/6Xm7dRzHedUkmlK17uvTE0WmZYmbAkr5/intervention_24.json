I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The scenario involves the author running a successful business, having trust issues from their parents' marriage, and the girlfriend getting upset when he mentioned wanting a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. A prenup is a legal document that can outline financial arrangements in case of divorce. It's common in many marriages, especially when there are assets involved. The author has a business earning $150k+, so a prenup might be prudent from a financial standpoint. Legally, it's a standard practice, so there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting one.\n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. The author explained that it's about security and his past experiences, not distrust. Trust is a big issue here. The author is working on trust issues, but his request for a prenup might be seen as a lack of commitment or trust in the relationship. However, the author's reasoning is about protecting themselves, not doubting the partner's intentions. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing financial security through a prenup. Legally, no. Emotionally, it's a communication issue. The problem might not be the prenup itself but how it was presented. The author tried to explain it's for security, but the girlfriend perceived it as distrust. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given their background. However, the situation highlights a need for better communication and understanding both perspectives. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
