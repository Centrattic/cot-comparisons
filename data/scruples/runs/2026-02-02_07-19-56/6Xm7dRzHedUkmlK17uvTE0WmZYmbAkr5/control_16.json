I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The key points here are the author's background and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author has built a successful business, which is a significant asset. They come from a family where marriage wasn't successful, leading to trust issues. They mention wanting a prenup not out of distrust but for security. The girlfriend felt hurt and insulted, interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust and the hesitation to marry as not valuing commitment.\n\nNow, considering the legal perspective, a prenup is a common practice for protecting individual assets, especially when one partner has substantial property or a business. It's not inherently distrustful but a practical legal measure. The author's stance is about financial security, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the emotional side, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling undervalued. She might see marriage as a commitment that shouldn't need legal safeguards. The conflict arises from differing views on commitment and security. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend didn't accept it, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup is not unethical or wrong. It's a personal choice influenced by their background. However, communication is key here. The author might need to work on explaining their reasoning better and addressing the girlfriend's feelings of being untrusted. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault for prioritizing their assets and having realistic expectations based on their family history. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
