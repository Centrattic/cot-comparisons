I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who owns a successful business, is being asked by his girlfriend about marriage. He's hesitant because of his family's failed marriage and trust issues. He mentioned wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a valid reason for wanting a prenup\u2014his parents' marriage was problematic, and he has trust issues. A prenup is a legal document that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. For someone with significant assets, like a business earning $150k+, a prenup is a common and responsible step to protect their financial interests. So from a practical standpoint, wanting a prenup is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she might view the prenup as a lack of trust. In many relationships, marriage is seen as a commitment where both parties are supposed to trust each other implicitly. The author tried to explain it's about his personal history and security, but she took it as a personal attack. That's a communication issue. The author's intention might be to secure his assets, but the way he presented it might have hurt her feelings.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? If he had a valid reason and communicated it clearly, then maybe not. But if he didn't consider how she might feel or didn't approach the conversation with sensitivity, that could be a problem. The key here is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. A prenup is a standard practice in many marriages, especially when one party has significant assets. So, in that sense, he's not wrong for wanting it.\n\nHowever, the way he brought it up might have been insensitive. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or framed it as a standard precaution rather than linking it to his distrust of her. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's need for financial security is also valid. It's a matter of mutual understanding and compromise. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer likely depends on whether his action (wanting a prenup) is inherently wrong. Since it's a common and reasonable step, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about communication and differing expectations rather than a moral wrong.\n"
