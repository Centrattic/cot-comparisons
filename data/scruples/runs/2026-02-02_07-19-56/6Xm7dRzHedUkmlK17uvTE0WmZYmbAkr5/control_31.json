I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author has a successful business, trust issues from their parents' troubled marriage, and they proposed the idea of a prenup. The girlfriend reacted negatively, feeling hurt and insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and practical aspects. Prenups are common in many relationships, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The author built a business worth $150k+, so a prenup would protect those assets in case of divorce. Legally, that's a reasonable step. There's no law saying you can't have a prenup, so the author isn't breaking any rules here.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The girlfriend felt insulted, which suggests that the way the author presented the prenup might have been a problem. Trust issues are personal, and while the author has valid reasons, the way they communicated this could have been hurtful. But is the author wrong for wanting a prenup? It's a matter of perspective. Some people see a prenup as practical, others as a lack of trust.\n\nThe author's family background is mentioned. Their parents' marriage was problematic, leading to trust issues. The author is trying to work on these issues but still wants a prenup. This shows they're aware of their own issues but are also taking steps to protect themselves. It's not necessarily wrong to want financial security.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She might feel that the prenup request is a lack of commitment or trust. However, the author clarified it's for their own security, not distrust in her. The conflict here is about differing values. The author prioritizes financial protection, while the girlfriend prioritizes emotional trust.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't legally wrong for wanting a prenup. Emotionally, it's a conflict in expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for having different needs. The key is whether their stance is unreasonable. Since prenups are a common and legal practice, especially with significant assets, the author isn't wrong. The issue is more about communication and mutual understanding rather than right or wrong.\n"
