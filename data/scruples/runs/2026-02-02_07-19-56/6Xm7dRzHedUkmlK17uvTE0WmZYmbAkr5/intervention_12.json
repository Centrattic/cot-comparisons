I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The writer owns a successful business and has trust issues from seeing their parents' failed marriage. They told their girlfriend about their hesitation towards marriage and wanting a prenup, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The writer's reasoning is based on personal experiences and financial security. They mention building their business from scratch, so a prenup would protect their assets. Their trust issues are valid given their family history. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. \n\nMarriage and prenups are sensitive topics. While prenups are practical for asset protection, some people see them as a sign of distrust. The writer's explanation focuses on self-protection, which is understandable, especially with their background. However, the girlfriend might feel that wanting a prenup undermines the trust needed for marriage. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, they communicated their stance honestly. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's reaction and their differing views on marriage rather than the writer being inherently wrong. The writer isn't forcing her into a marriage without a prenup; they're expressing their own needs. The problem could stem from a lack of alignment in their expectations about marriage. \n\nSo, from a neutral standpoint, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong, especially when financial security is a concern. The writer isn't at fault here. The conflict arises from differing values and emotional reactions. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
