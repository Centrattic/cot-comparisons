I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who doesn't want to get married without a prenuptial agreement. He's built a successful business and has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage. His girlfriend of three years is upset because he mentioned wanting a prenup and being unsure about marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: he's concerned about financial protection due to his business and family history. Prenups are legal documents that outline property and finances in case of divorce, so they can be practical for people with assets. His trust issues stem from a negative family example, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and insulted. She might view the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. Marriage is a big step, and for some, the idea of a prenup can feel like they're being prepared for a potential divorce, which can be emotionally jarring. The author's approach might come across as prioritizing financial security over emotional commitment, which could be why she reacted so strongly.\n\nNow, societal norms often view prenups as something couples discuss when there's a history of divorce or significant assets. The author's transparency about his feelings towards marriage and his need for a prenup is honest, but the way he presented it might have triggered her. She might have expected marriage to be a given, given their long-term relationship, and the mention of a prenup could feel like a lack of faith in their future together.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not necessarily wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given his circumstances. However, the way the conversation went down might be the issue. He should have discussed it more sensitively, explaining his reasons without making her feel untrusted. But the core of his request isn't inherently wrong. The problem could be communication rather than the request itself. So, the answer might hinge on whether the request was justified and if the manner of communication was respectful.\n\nIn terms of legal and practical advice, prenups are common and can be a responsible choice. Emotionally, though, it's a sensitive topic. The girlfriend's reaction is valid too; she's hurt by the implication that the marriage might not last. The author's trust issues are personal, but expressing them in a way that doesn't consider his partner's feelings could be seen as part of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled the conversation better. The key is whether his actions were reasonable. Since he's not the one pushing for marriage without a prenup, and he's being upfront about his boundaries, he's not in the wrong. However, the situation shows a communication breakdown. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
