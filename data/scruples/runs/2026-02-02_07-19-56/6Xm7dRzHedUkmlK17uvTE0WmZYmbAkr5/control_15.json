I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author has a successful business, earning over $150k a year. They built it from scratch. Their family's marriages were bad, with parents who constantly schemed against each other. This led to trust issues. The author doesn't view marriage as necessary and wants a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend took it as a personal insult, feeling hurt and distrustful. The author tried to explain it's about security, but she wasn't having it.\n\nFirst, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Prenups are legal tools to protect assets, especially if one or both partners have significant assets. The author's business is a big asset here. Their family history adds context\u2014seeing parents' marriages fail might make them cautious. Trust issues from that background could influence their decision.\n\nThe girlfriend reacting negatively is also valid. Marriage is a big commitment, and for many, a prenup can feel like a lack of trust. The author's explanation about security makes sense, but it's possible the way it was communicated hurt her feelings. Maybe she felt it wasn't about trust in her personally but a general distrust. However, the author is clear that it's not about her but their own experiences and need for security.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have valid reasons for wanting a prenup. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but the author isn't obligated to get married without legal protections, especially given their background. The key is that the author isn't denying love or commitment; they just want financial security. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from different views on marriage, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own security based on their experiences.\n"
