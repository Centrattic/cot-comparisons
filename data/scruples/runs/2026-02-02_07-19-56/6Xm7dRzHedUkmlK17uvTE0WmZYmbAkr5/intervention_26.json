I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a 27-year-old guy who owns a successful business, built from scratch. His family's marriages weren't healthy, leading to trust issues. He's in a 3-year relationship with a 26-year-old girlfriend, and when he mentioned wanting a prenup if they marry, she got upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning: he has a business, family history of distrustful marriages, and trust issues. He sees marriage not as a necessity but wants a prenup for his own security. His girlfriend, on the other hand, feels hurt and insulted by the prenup idea and the hesitation to marry.\n\nLegally, prenups are common to protect assets, especially when one partner has significant property or business. The author's stance is about financial security, which is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she might view the prenup as a lack of trust in the relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his financial security, even if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. Some people see prenups as practical, others as a lack of commitment. The author's background with problematic family marriages might make him more cautious. But the girlfriend's hurt feelings indicate that she might not share this view, seeing the prenup as a negative assumption about the marriage's future.\n\nTrust is a key component in relationships. The author mentions working on his trust issues, but bringing up a prenup might be perceived as undermining trust. However, he clarifies it's about security, not distrust in her. The conflict arises from differing values: financial protection vs. emotional trust.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not legally wrong to want a prenup. Financially, it's a smart move. Emotionally, though, it depends on mutual understanding. The problem is communication. The girlfriend felt insulted, which suggests the author didn't convey his reasoning effectively. He might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but perhaps in the way he communicated it, not considering her feelings. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, it's more about whether his stance is justified. Since he's protecting his assets and has valid reasons, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the prenup is causing unnecessary hurt without a real legal need, perhaps he is. But given his business and family history, it's reasonable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
