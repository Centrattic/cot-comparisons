I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 27-year-old with a successful business, making over $150k a year. They've been with their 26-year-old girlfriend for three years, living together for a year and a half. The author's family has a history of a troubled marriage between their parents, which led to trust issues. The author is considering marriage but wants a prenup. The girlfriend was upset, called the author a \"distrustful asshole,\" and felt insulted. \n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup. They mention trust issues from their parents' marriage and wanting security. The girlfriend reacted negatively, feeling hurt and insulted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, prenups are common and practical, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The author has a business, so protecting those assets makes sense. It's a way to ensure that in the event of a divorce, their business isn't split without their consent. \n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend might see the prenup as a lack of trust, even if the author explains it's about security. However, the author's stance is based on their personal history and experiences, not necessarily distrust of their partner. It's about protecting their own interests, which is a valid reason.\n\nIn relationships, differing views on marriage and legal protections can lead to conflict. The author isn't the only one at fault here; the girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. However, the question focuses on the author's actions. They are being honest about their needs and concerns, which is important in a relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a legitimate reason for wanting a prenup, especially given their financial situation and family history. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own security. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
