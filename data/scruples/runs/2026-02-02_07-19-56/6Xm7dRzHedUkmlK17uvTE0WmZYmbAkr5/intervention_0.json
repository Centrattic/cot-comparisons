I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author built a successful business, has trust issues due to their parents' failed marriage, and doesn't see marriage as necessary. When discussing marriage with their girlfriend, the author mentions wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend was hurt and felt insulted, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break down the factors. A prenup is a legal document that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. It's common in many relationships, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The author has a business earning over $150k, so protecting that makes sense legally. They also mention trust issues from their family background, which might influence their desire for a prenup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. She might view the prenup as a lack of trust in the marriage's longevity or fidelity. Marriage is often seen as a lifelong commitment, and a prenup could be perceived as planning for failure. However, the author's reasoning is about financial security and personal history, not distrust of the girlfriend herself. They tried to explain it's about their own security and past experiences.\n\nIs it wrong to want a prenup? Legally, it's a standard practice. Emotionally, it can be a sensitive topic. The key here is communication. Did the author approach the conversation appropriately? They tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend was upset. Maybe the way it was presented or the girlfriend's expectations played a role. However, the author isn't obligated to get married without a prenup, especially given their circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from hurt feelings or different views on marriage. It's possible she had different expectations about marriage and felt the prenup request was a red flag. But the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their assets. They're not the one being unreasonable here. The conflict arises from differing perspectives on marriage and financial security.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for wanting a prenup, and it's their right to set that condition. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable but doesn't make the author at fault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
