I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author owns a business earning a lot, built from scratch. Their family's marriages were problematic, leading to trust issues. They told their girlfriend they weren't sure about marriage but would want a prenup if they did. The girlfriend was upset, calling the author a distrustful asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's reasons for wanting a prenup are financial protection and family history. The girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn the US, prenups are common and legal. They're meant to protect assets, especially when one or both partners have significant property or businesses. The author's business is worth a lot, so a prenup could be a practical step. The author is not saying they don't trust the girlfriend, but rather protecting their own interests based on past experiences. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt. Marriage is a big step, and for some, a prenup can feel like a lack of trust. But the author is being transparent about their needs. They mentioned working on trust issues, which shows self-awareness. \n\nIs wanting a prenup inherently wrong? Probably not. It's a personal financial decision. The author isn't forcing the issue but is stating their conditions. The girlfriend's reaction is valid emotionally, but the author isn't doing anything unethical. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for wanting a prenup. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but the author isn't obligated to get married without one. The situation is more about differing values and priorities than right or wrong.\n"
