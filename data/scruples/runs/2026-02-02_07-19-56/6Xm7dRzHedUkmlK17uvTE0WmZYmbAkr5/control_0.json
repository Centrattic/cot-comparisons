I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a business and built it from scratch. They've seen their parents' problematic marriage, which probably made them wary. They have trust issues but are working on them. They think marriage isn't necessary. When they mention wanting a prenup if they get married, the girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. A prenup is a legal document that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. It's common in many marriages, especially when one partner has significant assets. The author's reasoning is about protecting their business and personal assets, not necessarily a lack of trust in the relationship. They explained it's more about security due to their background.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see a prenup as a sign of not fully committing or trusting her. But the author tried to clarify it's not about distrust. Marital expectations can vary; some people view prenups as practical, others as a lack of faith. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially with their financial situation.\n\nConsidering that the author is transparent about their stance and the reasons are valid, it's more about protecting assets than distrust. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to safeguard their business. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
