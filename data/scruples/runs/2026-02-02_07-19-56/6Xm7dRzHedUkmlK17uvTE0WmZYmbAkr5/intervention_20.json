I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author has a successful business, has trust issues from seeing their parents' bad marriage, and when discussing marriage with their girlfriend, the author mentions wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend got upset, calling the author a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's reasons for wanting a prenup are based on their personal history and business ownership. They mention trust issues from their family's example. The girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. The question is whether the author is wrong for this stance.\n\nPrenups are legal documents that outline the division of assets in case of divorce. They are common in situations where one or both partners have significant assets, businesses, or debts. The author's business earning $150k+ is a substantial asset. From a legal and financial perspective, having a prenup can protect both parties, especially if there's a business involved. The author isn't refusing marriage but is seeking legal protection, which is a reasonable consideration.\n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is important. The girlfriend felt that the prenup request implied a lack of trust in her. Marriage is typically seen as a lifelong commitment, and some might view a prenup as a sign that one partner doesn't trust the other to be faithful or to handle financial matters properly. The author is trying to explain it's not about distrust but about security, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way.\n\nThe author's age is 27, and the girlfriend is 26. They've been together three years and living together for 1.5 years. It's a significant relationship, but perhaps not long enough for both to fully understand each other's perspectives on marriage. The author's trust issues stem from their parents' toxic marriage, which is a valid reason. However, the way the author introduced the prenup could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about differing expectations. The author has a legitimate financial reason for a prenup, but the girlfriend's emotional response is also valid. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but they could be at fault for not discussing it more carefully. The girlfriend's feelings of being insulted might stem from how the prenup was brought up rather than the desire itself. Communication style matters here. If the author had approached it as a practical step rather than a legal safeguard, maybe the reaction would be different.\n\nIn many cases, prenups are discussed as part of planning the marriage, showing preparedness rather than distrust. However, if the author didn't consider the emotional impact, they might share some responsibility for not addressing the girlfriend's feelings adequately. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the author's stance is also reasonable given their circumstances.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Legally and financially, they're justified. Emotionally, maybe they could have handled it better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the request for a prenup is a common legal practice and the author's reasons are valid, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the way it was communicated could be improved, but that's about communication style rather than being in the wrong. The author isn't wrong for wanting a prenup, just perhaps could have explained it more effectively.\n"
