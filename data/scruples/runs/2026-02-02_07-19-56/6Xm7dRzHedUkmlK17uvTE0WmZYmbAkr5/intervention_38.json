I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author owns a business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. They have trust issues from their parents' failed marriage. They told their girlfriend they're unsure about marriage and would want a prenup if they did. The girlfriend was hurt and called him a distrustful asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is about protecting their assets, given their business and family history. Prenups are legal tools to protect individual assets, so that's a valid point. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, possibly seeing the prenup as a lack of trust in the relationship's future.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Legally and financially, prenups are common and sensible, especially with significant assets. Emotionally, the author's past might justify their stance. However, the way the author presented the prenup could have affected the girlfriend's feelings. The key is whether the author's request for a prenup is unreasonable.\n\nMarriage is a big step, and having a prenup doesn't necessarily mean distrust; it's about practicality. The author is being proactive. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from emotional hurt, possibly expecting marriage to be a symbol of trust without legal safeguards. The author isn't the one who said \"I do\" first; he's stating his conditions if they marry. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. The issue is more about communication and differing expectations. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
