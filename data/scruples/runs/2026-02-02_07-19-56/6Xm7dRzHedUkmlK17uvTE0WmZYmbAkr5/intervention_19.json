I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author built a successful business and has trust issues due to their parents' troubled marriage. They mentioned wanting a prenup if they got married, which upset their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is considering a prenup for financial security, not distrust. Their partner felt insulted and hurt. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, prenups are common and practical, especially when one partner has significant assets. The author's reasons are about protecting their business and managing trust issues. However, the girlfriend perceived it as distrust, which can be a valid emotional response. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They have a legitimate reason for wanting a prenup. The conflict arises from the girlfriend's reaction. In relationships, differing expectations can lead to conflict. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong; it's about personal boundaries and financial planning. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing their security. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author's decision is based on their personal history and financial protection, which is reasonable. The issue is more about communication and differing values rather than one party being wrong.\n"
