I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old who runs a successful business earning over $150k a year. They've been together with their girlfriend for three years and have been living together for about a year and a half. They mentioned not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement. Their girlfriend got upset, calling them a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt that he might never want to get married. The author explains that their family history of unsuccessful marriages and deep-seated trust issues influence their stance. They argue that the prenup is for their own financial security, not a lack of trust in their partner.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has built a successful business, which likely has significant financial value. Given that, a prenup is a common-sense legal measure to protect personal assets in case of a divorce. Many people in similar situations opt for prenups to avoid potential conflicts and ensure their financial stability. The author's reasoning is based on their family history, which has shown them negative examples of marriage, leading to trust issues. They are trying to approach marriage with practicality and caution.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. She might view the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment, interpreting it as a sign that the author doesn't believe the marriage will last. This is a common reaction because, in romantic relationships, especially when discussing marriage, emotions run high. The girlfriend might feel that her partner is not fully committing to the marriage if a prenup is required, even if the author's intention is purely financial protection.\n\nThe author tried to explain that the prenup is about personal security, not distrust, but she didn't accept that. This suggests a communication breakdown. The author might need to work on explaining their perspective more effectively, but does that make them at fault? The author's stance is legally sound and financially prudent. It's not against the law to have a prenup, and it's a reasonable step in many cases. The emotional reaction from the girlfriend is valid too, as relationships involve emotional bonds, and financial discussions can be sensitive.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are: the author's right to protect their assets, their history and trust issues, and the girlfriend's feelings. Legally, the author is not in the wrong for wanting a prenup. The disagreement is more about differing expectations and emotional responses rather than a moral or legal fault. The author is prioritizing their financial security based on past experiences, which is a personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting a prenup. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but that doesn't make the author wrong for having that request.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
