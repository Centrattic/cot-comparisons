I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves trust issues from a bad family history and financial considerations from owning a business.\n\nFirst, the author has valid reasons. Their parents' failed marriage with constant conflict might make them cautious. They built a successful business, so a prenup makes sense for financial security. They communicated their stance, explaining it's about personal security, not distrust. The girlfriend got upset, feeling insulted and hurt. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a legal tool to protect assets, especially when one partner has significant property or earnings. The author isn't dismissing marriage but setting boundaries. However, the girlfriend's reaction shows she might view the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The author tried to explain it's not about trust but security. The girlfriend didn't accept that. Maybe the issue is more about differing expectations rather than right or wrong. If the author is honest about their needs and the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe she's the one with an issue. But if the author's stance is rigid without flexibility, that could be a problem. However, given the context, the author's position seems reasonable. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
