I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Their background is they own a successful business making $150k+ a year, built from scratch. They had trust issues from their parents' failed marriage where they constantly tried to screw each other over. They told their girlfriend (26) that they weren't sure about marriage but if they did, they'd want a prenup. The girlfriend got really upset, called them a distrustful asshole, felt insulted and hurt. The user is 27, they've been together 3 years, living together for 1.5 years.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The main points here are the decision to not marry without a prenup and the girlfriend's reaction. The user's reasoning is about personal security and past experiences. The girlfriend is hurt because she feels the prenup is a sign of distrust and the user doesn't want to marry her.\n\nPrenups are legal documents that outline the division of assets in case of divorce. They can be seen as practical, especially for people with significant assets. The user has a business, so protecting that makes sense. However, the girlfriend interprets it as a lack of trust. There's also the part where the user says they're not sure if they ever want to get married, which might be the bigger issue here. The girlfriend might feel that the user isn't committed, or is using the prenup as a way to avoid marriage altogether. \n\nThe user's family history of failed marriages could influence their fear of legal and financial entanglements. But in a relationship, especially when discussing marriage, communication is key. The user tried to explain it's for security, but the girlfriend didn't accept that. Maybe the way it was presented was off-putting. If the user is hesitant about marriage in general, that's a separate issue from the prenup. The girlfriend might be ready for marriage and sees the prenup as a red flag, while the user sees it as necessary protection.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Many people in similar situations with assets do it. But if the user is not committed to marriage and is using the prenup as a way to avoid it, then maybe. The problem here is that the user is hesitant about marriage and brings up a prenup, which the girlfriend takes as a mistrust. The user's honesty about their hesitation is important, but maybe the girlfriend saw the prenup request as a dealbreaker, while the user sees it as a necessity. It's a conflict of values and priorities. The user isn't being inconsiderate about their own needs, but they might be underestimating the emotional impact on their partner. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because in her eyes, the prenup is a barrier to marriage, which she might perceive as a lack of commitment or love. The user's trust issues are from their family, but marriage is a personal choice. The key is whether the prenup is a reasonable request given their circumstances. Since the user has a business and a history of financial issues in the family, a prenup is a responsible step. However, the girlfriend feeling insulted and hurt suggests that the user's approach might have been insensitive or that the issue runs deeper than just the prenup. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but the situation shows a fundamental disagreement about the institution of marriage itself. The user's reluctance to marry, even with a prenup, might be the real issue here. The girlfriend could see marriage as a commitment they're not willing to make, which is hurtful. So, the user's stance on marriage as a necessity is conflicting with the girlfriend's desire for it. The prenup is a symptom, not the root problem. The user is being honest, but if the core issue is not wanting to get married at all, then that's where the problem lies. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling untrusted and not wanted in marriage, which is a significant emotional aspect. The user's trust issues are personal, but the request for a prenup isn't inherently wrong. However, if the user is using the prenup as a reason to avoid marriage entirely, that might be the issue. The user is not in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but the underlying reluctance to commit to marriage is where the conflict is. The answer would depend on whether the prenup is a reasonable request or a way to avoid marriage. Since the user is a business owner with a history of family issues, a prenup is a practical measure. The girlfriend's reaction is about the emotional aspect, but the user isn't wrong for prioritizing their own security. So, Answer B.\n"
