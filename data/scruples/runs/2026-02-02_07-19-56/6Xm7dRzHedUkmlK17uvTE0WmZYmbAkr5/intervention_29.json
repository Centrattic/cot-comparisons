I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author owns a successful business and has trust issues from their parents' failed marriage. They told their girlfriend they want a prenup if they get married, which upset her. She felt insulted and called him a distrustful asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me break it down. A prenuptial agreement is a legal contract that outlines how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce. It's common in many relationships, especially when one or both partners have significant assets or businesses. The author has a business earning over $150k a year, so protecting that makes sense from a financial standpoint. \n\nThe girlfriend might see the prenup as a lack of trust, but the author explains it's about security. Trust issues stemming from his parents' marriage might contribute to his desire for a prenup. However, the reaction from the girlfriend suggests that she values trust and commitment highly, and the mention of a prenup might have been perceived as not having faith in the relationship's longevity.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. Some people view prenups as practical, while others see them as a sign that someone expects the marriage to fail. The author's stance isn't about not wanting to marry but about wanting financial security. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his need for a prenup, which is a reasonable request given his circumstances. However, the way he communicated it might have hurt her feelings. The key is whether his request is justified. Since he's protecting his assets and has a history of family issues, it's understandable. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel hurt. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. Legally and financially, a prenup is a normal part of marriage planning for some. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting one. The conflict arises from differing expectations and communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
