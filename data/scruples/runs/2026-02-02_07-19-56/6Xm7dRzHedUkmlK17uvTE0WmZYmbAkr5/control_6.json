I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person owns a successful business and is considering not getting married without a prenuptial agreement. Their girlfriend is upset because she feels insulted and hurt by the idea of a prenup and the possibility that he might not want to get married at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and practical aspects. A prenup is a legal document that outlines how assets are divided in case of a divorce. For someone with a business and significant earnings, having a prenup makes sense to protect their assets. It's a common practice in many places, especially when there's a big difference in assets between partners or when one partner has a business.\n\nThe author mentions trust issues from seeing their parents' failed marriage. They're not necessarily not trusting their girlfriend but are cautious due to past experiences. The girlfriend, however, feels insulted, which suggests she might view the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. There's a communication gap here. The author tried to explain it's about security, but the girlfriend didn't accept that reasoning.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, wanting a prenup is not wrong. It's a protective measure. Emotionally, the girlfriend's feelings are valid\u2014she's upset because she might feel the prenup implies doubt in the marriage's longevity. But the author's perspective is about protecting their assets, which is also reasonable. \n\nThe key here is mutual understanding and negotiation. If the author had approached the prenup discussion earlier and more collaboratively, maybe the reaction would have been different. However, the question is about right or wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's stance is practical. Since the author has a legitimate reason for wanting a prenup, it's not necessarily wrong. The problem might be in how the conversation was handled, but the desire itself isn't unethical or wrong. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
