I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding wanting a prenup before getting married. The context is that the author has a successful business, earns $150k+ a year, built it from scratch, and has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage. His girlfriend is upset because he mentioned not being sure about marriage and wanting a prenup, which she took as a personal insult and distrust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around prenups. In many places, prenuptial agreements are legal and often used to protect individual assets, especially if one party has significant property or business interests. The author is in a position where his business is valuable, so a prenup could make sense to safeguard that in case of a divorce. It's not necessarily about distrust in the relationship but more about practical legal protection.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. The author tried to explain it's for security, not distrust, but she didn't accept that. This shows a communication issue. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable and if the girlfriend's reaction is unfair. In some cases, people might feel that a prenup is a negative start to marriage, but others understand it as a responsible step.\n\nThe author's family background with problematic marriages might influence his perspective. He's seen how things can go wrong, so he's trying to avoid similar issues. However, the girlfriend might not share that history and might feel it's being projected onto her. Trust issues from the family could be a valid reason, but the way it's communicated matters. If the author approached the discussion without blame and focused on the practical aspects, maybe the reaction would be different.\n\nConsidering the girlfriend's age and the length of the relationship, they've been together for three years. That's a significant time, and discussing marriage is natural. The author's hesitation isn't necessarily a bad thing. Wanting a prenup is a common practice, especially when there are assets involved. The main question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his financial security. Legally, no. Emotionally, it depends on how it's handled.\n\nBut the girlfriend's feelings are important too. If she feels that the prenup request is a betrayal of trust, even if it's not intended that way, it can strain the relationship. The author might need to work on his communication style to address her concerns, but he isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. It's about mutual understanding and compromise. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
