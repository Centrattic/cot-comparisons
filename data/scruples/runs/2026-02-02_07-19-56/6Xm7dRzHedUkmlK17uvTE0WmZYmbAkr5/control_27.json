I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author has a business, so they probably have significant assets. Their family history includes a problematic marriage, leading to trust issues. They proposed the idea of a prenup, but their girlfriend reacted negatively, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author's stance is about financial security and past experiences affecting their trust. A prenup is a legal document that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. It's a common practice, especially for those with substantial assets. The author isn't refusing marriage entirely but is setting a condition for it. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected. Marriage is often seen as a symbol of trust and commitment, so suggesting a prenup might come across as a lack of faith in the relationship. The emotional reaction is understandable because she might perceive it as a lack of commitment or a preemptive move for divorce, even if that's not the case. \n\nLegally, a prenup is a legitimate and responsible step, especially when protecting personal assets. The author is not wrong for wanting to secure their financial future. However, the way the conversation was handled could be a point of contention. The author should have approached the discussion more sensitively, explaining the rationale behind the prenup to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author's intention was about security, not distrust. But the girlfriend interpreted it as distrust. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because seeking a prenup is a reasonable decision given their background and financial situation. However, the lack of effective communication might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, marriage often comes with certain emotional connotations, and introducing a prenup can be seen as a pragmatic but emotionally charged step. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might have envisioned marriage as a trust-based union without legal safeguards. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. Their actions are rooted in personal history and financial responsibility. The conflict arises from differing views on marriage and communication issues rather than the author being inherently wrong.\n"
