I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe author owns a successful business, earns $150k+ a year, and built it from the ground up. Their family background includes unsuccessful marriages and trust issues. They mentioned that their parents had a contentious relationship, which probably influenced their views. The author is 27, the girlfriend is 26, and they've been together for three years. When discussing marriage, the author proposed wanting a prenup if they ever married, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, saying the author is distrustful. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, prenups are practical for protecting assets, especially if one partner has significant property. The author's business is a major asset. A prenup can prevent legal battles in case of divorce, which is a reasonable step. The author's stance is based on protecting their own financial future, not necessarily distrust. However, the girlfriend perceived it as distrust, which is a common emotional reaction. The author's family history of failed marriages might make them more cautious. \n\nBut the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. Marriage is seen as a trusting union, so suggesting a prenup might feel like a lack of commitment. The author's explanation is about security, but the girlfriend's emotional response is valid. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Prenups are common in many relationships, especially when there's a business or significant assets. The author isn't refusing marriage; they're just wanting a prenup for protection. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might see this as a red flag. It's possible the author is in the right for wanting to protect their assets, but the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The author tried to explain it's not about distrust, but the girlfriend didn't accept that. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but maybe they could have handled the conversation better. But according to the question, are they in the wrong for not wanting marriage without a prenup? The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because wanting a prenup is a reasonable step for financial protection, especially given their background and assets.\n"
