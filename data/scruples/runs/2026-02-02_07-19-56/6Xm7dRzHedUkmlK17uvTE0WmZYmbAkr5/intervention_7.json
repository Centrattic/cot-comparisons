I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author runs a successful business and has trust issues due to their parents' failed marriage. They told their girlfriend they wanted a prenup if they got married, which upset her. She felt hurt and accused him of distrust.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, wanting a prenup is about protecting his assets and personal security, especially since he built a business. His trust issues stem from family experiences, so he's being cautious. Legally, prenups are common in many places to outline financial arrangements in case of divorce. His stance isn't necessarily about distrust in the relationship's success but about personal protection.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. Marriage is a big step, and the mention of a prenup might make her feel like he doesn't believe in the marriage's longevity or trust. Her reaction shows that she values trust and commitment, seeing a prenup as a lack of faith in their future together.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. The key points are: Is wanting a prenup inherently wrong? In many legal systems, it's a standard practice, especially for those with significant assets. The author isn't refusing marriage but setting conditions for it. His reasons are based on personal history and financial protection. However, communication is crucial. If he approached the topic without considering her feelings and the emotional impact, that might be a problem. But given his explanation, he tried to explain his reasoning, even though she didn't accept it.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid too. She might feel that the prenup request undermines the trust and commitment marriage symbolizes. However, her not accepting any discussion about it is also a factor. The conflict arises from differing values\u2014his need for security versus her need for trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Arguably, no. He's making a decision based on his personal experiences and financial situation. Wanting a prenup isn't inherently disrespectful; it's a legal precaution. The issue might be more about their communication styles and differing expectations rather than one party being wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
