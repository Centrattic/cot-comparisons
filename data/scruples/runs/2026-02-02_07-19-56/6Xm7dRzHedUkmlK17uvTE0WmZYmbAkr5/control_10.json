I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has a successful business and trust issues from their parents' failed marriage. They're not sure about marriage and want a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend felt hurt and called the author a distrustful asshole. She didn't want a prenup, which led to a conflict.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for wanting a prenup. From a legal standpoint, prenups are common and can protect both parties, especially if one has significant assets. The author's background with trust issues and their parents' experiences might make a prenup a reasonable precaution. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt the prenup was a sign of distrust, which could be emotional for her.\n\nMarriage is a big step, and having a prenup can actually show a desire to handle things responsibly rather than a lack of trust. But communication is key here. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way. Maybe the way the author brought it up was hurtful, but the desire for a prenup itself isn't wrong. It's about mutual understanding and whether both parties are willing to compromise. \n\nSince the author is advocating for their own security and has valid reasons based on their history, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's feelings and how the topic was discussed. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
