I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author owns a successful business, has trust issues due to parents' failed marriage, and proposed a prenup when discussing marriage with his girlfriend. She was hurt and called him a distrustful asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he built his business and wants financial security, especially given his family history. He's not against marriage but wants a prenup for protection. The girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, possibly because she viewed marriage as a sign of trust and commitment without legal safeguards. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Legally, prenups are common and advisable in many cases, especially when there's significant assets involved. The author has a valid point about protecting his business and financial status. However, the way he communicated this might have caused hurt feelings. The girlfriend might feel that suggesting a prenup implies a lack of trust in their relationship. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the context. If the prenup is about financial security and not distrust, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the girlfriend felt disrespected or that the prenup was a personal attack, then the approach could be seen as insensitive. However, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step for many people. The key might be how it's discussed rather than the decision itself. The author might need to better explain his reasoning to avoid misunderstandings, but he isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting one.\n"
