I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. He owns a successful business earning over $150k a year. He comes from a family where his parents' marriage was problematic, with constant distrust and manipulation. He has trust issues as a result and hasn't seen marriage as necessary. When discussing marriage, he mentioned not being sure about getting married and wanting a prenup if they did. His girlfriend was upset, calling him a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt. The author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. A prenuptial agreement is a legal document that outlines each partner's financial rights and obligations in case of divorce or death. It's a common practice in many places to protect individual assets, especially if one partner has significant assets or a business. The author's concern about protecting his business and earnings makes sense from a legal standpoint. He's not the first person to consider a prenup for this reason.\n\nNow, the emotional side. His girlfriend was hurt and felt insulted. Marriage is often seen as a symbol of trust and commitment. Proposing a prenup might be interpreted as a lack of trust in the relationship's longevity or in his partner's intentions. However, the author clarifies that it's about security and his personal history, not distrust in her. That's an important distinction. He's not necessarily distrustful of her but wants to protect his assets based on his family's experiences.\n\nCommunication is key here. Did he approach the topic in a way that respected her feelings? He mentioned trying to explain it's about security, but she might not have felt heard. Maybe the way it was brought up was abrupt or not sensitive enough. Relationships require both parties to feel secure and respected. If she felt disrespected, that's a valid concern.\n\nHis background adds context. His parents' marriage was toxic, leading to his trust issues. That's a legitimate reason to be cautious. However, his girlfriend might not understand or relate to that history, leading to conflict. It's possible he didn't communicate his reasons effectively, or she might not be open to the idea of a prenup, seeing it as a lack of commitment.\n\nIn many cultures, marriage without a prenup is the norm, and suggesting one can be a red flag for some people. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from different expectations about marriage. If she views marriage as a lifelong partnership where assets are shared, a prenup could feel like a breach of that trust. But from his perspective, it's about protecting his hard-earned assets and not repeating his parents' mistakes.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being honest about his needs and circumstances, he's not being dishonest. However, if he didn't consider her feelings or didn't present the idea in a way that shows mutual respect, that could be where things went wrong. Alternatively, if she's unwilling to consider a prenup despite his valid concerns, the issue is more about differing values.\n\nIn summary, the author's stance is legally sound and based on personal experiences. However, the conflict arises from how it was communicated and how his partner perceives it. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their communication and expectations. Since he's trying to set boundaries and protect his assets, which is reasonable, and she's reacting emotionally, it's a complex situation where both might have valid points. But based on the information given, he's not necessarily in the wrong because he's being upfront about his needs.\n"
