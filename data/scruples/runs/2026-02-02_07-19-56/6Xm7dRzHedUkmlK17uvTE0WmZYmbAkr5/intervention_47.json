I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 27-year-old with a successful business, making $150k+ a year. They've been in a 3-year relationship, living together for 1.5 years. The girlfriend is 26. The issue arose when the author expressed hesitation about marriage without a prenup. The girlfriend felt insulted and accused the author of distrust. The author explains it's about personal security and trust issues stemming from their parents' troubled marriage. The girlfriend, however, reacted negatively.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have valid reasons. Their business is a significant asset, and a prenup is a financial safeguard. They mention trust issues from their family background, which could influence their desire for legal protection. The author isn't saying they don't trust their partner, but they want to protect their own interests. This is a common practice, especially when one or both partners have substantial assets. The author is being proactive about their financial security, which is a reasonable step.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling hurt and insulted. She might see marriage as a pure, trust-based commitment, and the mention of a prenup could be perceived as a lack of faith in the relationship. Her emotional response is understandable, as prenups can sometimes be seen as a sign of distrust. However, it's also important to recognize that financial planning is a mature and responsible aspect of marriage, especially with high-value assets involved.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for wanting a prenup. Legally and financially, prenups are standard for protecting individual assets. Emotionally, the girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author's concerns are also legitimate. The problem might lie in how the author communicated their stance. If the author had introduced the idea earlier or framed it more as a practical decision rather than a distrustful one, it might have been received differently. However, the author did explain their reasoning was about security and past family issues, which could mitigate the perception of distrust.\n\nIn many relationships, discussing a prenup is part of the planning for marriage, especially when significant assets are involved. The author isn't refusing marriage outright but is setting conditions. The girlfriend's refusal to consider a prenup might be the crux of the issue. She might not be open to the idea, which could lead to conflict if they proceed with marriage without one.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision based on their personal history and financial situation. The girlfriend's reaction is more about emotional hurt than actual wrongdoing by the author. The author isn't being disrespectful or untrustworthy by wanting a prenup; they're protecting themselves. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). However, there's a balance here. If the author had communicated better or considered the emotional impact more, maybe the situation could have been handled differently, but the core issue of wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong.\n"
