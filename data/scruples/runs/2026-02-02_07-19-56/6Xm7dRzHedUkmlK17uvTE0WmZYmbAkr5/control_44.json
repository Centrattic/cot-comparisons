I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about him not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is 27, has a successful business, and has trust issues from seeing his parents' failed marriage. He's in a 3-year relationship, and when he mentioned not wanting marriage without a prenup, his girlfriend of 26 was upset, feeling insulted and hurt. He tried to explain it's about security, but she didn't accept it.\n\nNow, considering the context: Prenups are legal documents that outline asset division in case of divorce. They're common in marriages where one or both partners have significant assets. The author's business is valuable, so a prenup would protect his assets. His trust issues come from his family's history, which isn't the girlfriend's fault. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is emotional; she feels the prenup implies distrust. But the author's stance is about financial security, not personal trust in the relationship. It's reasonable for him to want a prenup, especially with his business background. \n\nLegal perspective: Prenups are a standard practice in many marriages, especially when there's substantial property. It doesn't necessarily mean distrust; it's a practical step. The author isn't wrong for wanting that. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but her reaction might stem from personal insecurities or different views on marriage. \n\nThe author tried to explain his reasoning, which is important. The conflict here is about differing expectations. Neither side is entirely wrong; they need to communicate better. Since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, he's not in the wrong for wanting a prenup. His reasons are justified given his background and assets. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
