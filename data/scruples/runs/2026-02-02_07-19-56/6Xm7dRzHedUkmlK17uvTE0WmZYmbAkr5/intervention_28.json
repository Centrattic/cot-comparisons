I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a guy who owns a business and his girlfriend. He's hesitant about marriage due to his family's negative experiences and wants a prenup for security. His girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective is about financial security and trust issues stemming from his parents' marriage. He's not against marriage but wants a prenup as a precaution. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, feeling disrespected and possibly seeing the prenup as a lack of trust.\n\nIs wanting a prenup inherently wrong? In many cases, prenups are seen as practical, especially when one partner has significant assets. It's a way to protect both parties, actually. However, the way it's communicated matters. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but his girlfriend felt insulted. Maybe the communication wasn't effective. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the issue is about not wanting to get married without a prenup, that's a personal decision. However, if the problem is that he's causing emotional pain without considering her feelings, maybe there's some fault. But the girlfriend's reaction is extreme. She called him a \"distrustful asshole,\" which is harsh. Her not listening to his reasoning could indicate she's not open to discussion. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, prenups are becoming more accepted, especially in cases where there's a significant financial disparity or assets to protect. The author has a legitimate concern. The girlfriend's hurt feelings might stem from not feeling trusted, but he clarified it's about his own security, not hers. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a responsible choice to protect his assets, which is a common practice. The girlfriend's overreaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
