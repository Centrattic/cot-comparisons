I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves trust issues from the author's family background and a conflict with his girlfriend over marriage and a prenup.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he has a successful business, trust issues from his parents' failed marriage, and sees marriage as unnecessary. He's proposed a prenup to protect his assets, which seems practical. But his girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, interpreting it as a lack of trust in her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Many people use them to protect their assets, especially if they have significant property or businesses. The author's trust issues stem from his family's experiences, which adds context. However, the way he presented the prenup might have been a dealbreaker for his girlfriend, who may view marriage as a symbol of trust and commitment. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's stance is disrespectful or if it's a valid precaution. Since he's clear that it's for his security and not distrust of her, but she still feels hurt, it's a communication issue. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup; it's a personal choice. The conflict arises from differing views on marriage and trust. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might see a prenup as necessary, especially with significant assets. Others might see it as undermining trust. The author's position is justified from a practical standpoint, so he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid too, given her feelings about marriage. It's a clash of perspectives, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing his security. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
