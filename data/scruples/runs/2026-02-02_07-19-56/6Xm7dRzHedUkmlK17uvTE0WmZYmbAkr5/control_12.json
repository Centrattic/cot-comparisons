I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves him not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy owns a successful business making over $150k a year. He built it from the ground up. His family's marriages were problematic, especially his parents' constant conflicts. He has trust issues because of that. He doesn't see marriage as necessary. When discussing marriage with his girlfriend, he mentioned not being sure about marriage and wanting a prenup. She was hurt and called him a distrustful asshole. Now he's questioning if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here are his reasons for wanting a prenup and his stance on marriage. Let me consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. She might view the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. On the other hand, the guy has valid reasons based on family history and financial security. A prenup is a common legal tool to protect assets, especially when one partner has significant property. His hesitation about marriage could be due to past experiences, not necessarily distrust of his partner.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step for financial protection. His reasons are personal and based on his background. However, the way he presented it might have been hurtful. Maybe he could have approached the conversation more sensitively, emphasizing that it's about security rather than distrust. But the core issue isn't about him being untrustworthy; it's about his own experiences and financial prudence.\n\nHis girlfriend's reaction is understandable too. Feeling insulted suggests she might view marriage as a union without such legalities. There's a mismatch in their expectations. The problem here is more about differing values and communication rather than one party being wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since his stance is based on personal history and financial protection, which are reasonable, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The conflict arises from their differing perspectives, not from his actions being inherently unethical or unfair.\n"
