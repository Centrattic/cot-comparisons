I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author has a successful business, trust issues from their parents' marriage, and their girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about protecting their assets and trust issues. Prenups are legal documents that can protect both parties in case of divorce, so that's practical. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and insulted, interpreting it as a lack of trust in the relationship.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a common and responsible step for people with significant assets. The author's background with family issues adds context. However, the way it was communicated might have contributed to the girlfriend's hurt feelings. The key is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since both parties are entering a marriage, discussing financial terms is a normal part of planning. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling untrusted, but the author's need for a prenup is also valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason, and having a prenup can prevent future conflicts. The issue might be more about communication. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
