I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting a prenup and being unsure about marriage.\n\nFirst, the author has a business and a good income. They come from a family where marriage wasn't successful, leading to trust issues. They've been with their girlfriend for three years and live together. When they mention wanting a prenup and hesitation about marriage, it causes conflict. The girlfriend feels insulted and hurt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, wanting a prenup is common, especially when one partner has significant assets. It's a way to protect those assets in case of divorce. The author isn't saying they don't trust their partner; they're focusing on personal security based on family history. \n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend is hurt because she might see marriage as a commitment where a prenup isn't necessary. But the author's reasoning is tied to their past experiences and financial situation. \n\nIt's possible that the conflict arises from differing views on what marriage entails. The author isn't the first to want a prenup, but the way it's communicated might matter. However, the core issue is the author's right to seek legal protections. \n\nIn many cases, having a prenup is a responsible decision, not a sign of distrust. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting it. The problem might be more about how the conversation was handled rather than the request itself. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
