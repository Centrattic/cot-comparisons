I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author owns a successful business, making over $150k a year. They have trust issues because of their parents' failed marriage, where each tried to take advantage of the other. They told their girlfriend that if they get married, they want a prenup and aren't sure they want to get married at all. The girlfriend got upset, called him a distrustful asshole, and felt insulted and hurt. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the key points are the author's reasons: their personal history with their parents' marriage, the desire for a prenup for security, and not being certain about marriage. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling insulted and hurt, interpreting the prenup as distrust and the lack of marriage interest as a lack of commitment.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup is a common practice, especially for someone with significant assets. Prenups are meant to protect both parties in case of a divorce, not to distrust the partner. The author is being upfront about their feelings and financial planning. However, the way the author communicated this might have been problematic. Instead of explaining it as a precaution, it might have been perceived as a lack of trust. The girlfriend's hurt feelings could stem from feeling that the author isn't fully committed or doesn't trust their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons based on their family history. They're being honest about their stance on marriage and their need for financial security. The girlfriend might have different expectations about marriage, expecting it to be a lifelong commitment without legal protections. The conflict here is about differing values and expectations. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their assets, but perhaps could have approached the conversation with more sensitivity to the girlfriend's feelings about marriage.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. It's a reasonable step for someone with their financial situation and family background. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she views the prenup as a lack of trust, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's more about whether they can reconcile these differing perspectives. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
