I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author owns a business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. Their family has a history of problematic marriages, especially their parents who were constantly trying to undermine each other. This has led to trust issues for the author. They're in a 3-year relationship, living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author mentioned uncertainty about marriage and wanting a prenup if they did get married. The girlfriend was upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. So, the key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup and not being sure about marriage. They built their business themselves, which probably means they have significant assets. A prenup is a legal document that outlines financial arrangements in case of divorce. It's common in situations where one partner has substantial assets to protect them, especially if there's a history of trust issues or complex financial situations.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was anger and feeling insulted. She might see the prenup as a lack of trust in the relationship. But the author's stance is based on their personal history and need for financial security. The author is trying to be honest about their feelings and concerns. They're not avoiding marriage entirely but setting conditions if they do choose to marry.\n\nNow, societal norms might suggest that marriage is a lifelong commitment, so some might view a prenup as undermining that trust. However, others argue that a prenup is a practical step to protect both parties, especially when there's a significant disparity in assets or a history of family issues.\n\nThe author's trust issues stem from their parents' toxic relationship. They're working on these issues, which shows self-awareness. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be expecting a more traditional approach to marriage without legal protections. The conflict arises from differing expectations and the emotional weight the girlfriend attaches to the idea of marriage without a prenup.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a personal decision based on their circumstances. They're not forcing the relationship into marriage but are being upfront about their conditions. The girl's reaction is valid in that she feels hurt, but the author's reasons are rooted in their experiences and practicality. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners need to communicate their needs and expectations. The author is taking responsibility for their feelings and financial situation. The girlfriend might need to address her own expectations about marriage. Since the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their assets and is honest about their stance, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). However, it's important to note that relationships require mutual understanding, so while the author isn't in the wrong, their approach might need more empathy or discussion to address the girlfriend's feelings.\n"
