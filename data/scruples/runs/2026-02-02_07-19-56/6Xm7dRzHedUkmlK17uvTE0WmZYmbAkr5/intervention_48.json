I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation involves a couple discussing marriage. The author runs a business earning over $150k a year, built from scratch. His family's marriages were problematic, leading to trust issues. He's considering a prenup if they get married, but his girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is based on personal experiences and financial security. His trust issues come from family conflicts, and he wants a prenup as a safeguard. On the other hand, the girlfriend is hurt because she perceives the prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. \n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing his own security? Well, wanting a prenup isn't about distrust in the relationship but about legal and financial protection. However, the way he communicated it might have been a problem. Did he explain it properly? He says he tried to explain it's about security, not distrust. But maybe he could have approached it more sensitively.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should consider each other's feelings. The author has valid reasons, but if the girlfriend feels insulted, there's a communication issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, but perhaps he didn't handle the conversation well. However, the question is if he's in the wrong for the stance itself. \n\nPrenups are common in many relationships, especially with significant assets. The author's business adds complexity. His stance isn't unethical. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from unmet expectations about marriage. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
