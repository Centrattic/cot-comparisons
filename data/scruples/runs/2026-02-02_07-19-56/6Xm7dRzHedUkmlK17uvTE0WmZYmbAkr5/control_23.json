Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 27, has a successful business making over $150k a year, built it from the ground up. Their family's marriages weren't great; parents had constant issues and tried to undermine each other. They have trust issues but are working on them. They don't see marriage as necessary. \n\nWhen discussing marriage with their 26-year-old girlfriend, the author says they're unsure about getting married and would want a prenup if they did. The girlfriend reacts strongly, calling them a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt that they might never want to marry her. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but she wouldn't listen.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key points here are: the author's personal history affecting their view on marriage, their financial situation and the importance of a prenup, and the girlfriend's reaction based on her feelings. \n\nMarriage and prenups can be a sensitive topic. A prenup is a legal agreement that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. For someone with a business, it's a way to protect their assets. The author's hesitation is understandable given their family's negative experiences. They mentioned it's about security, not distrust. \n\nBut the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. It's possible she didn't want to consider the possibility of a prenup because it might have made the idea of marriage feel more transactional or less trusting. The author brought up the topic during a discussion about marriage, which could be seen as a red flag or a practical step. \n\nThe author is being honest about their needs and concerns. They have a right to protect their assets, especially given their background. However, the way they presented it might have come off as a rejection of the marriage itself. Maybe the girlfriend expected marriage to be a more idealistic step without considering the practical aspects. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to explain their reasoning as being about security, but the girlfriend didn't accept that. It's a conflict between practicality and emotional expectations. \n\nI don't see anything inherently wrong with wanting a prenup. It's a common practice in many marriages, especially when there are significant assets involved. The author isn't against marriage, just wants to have a prenup for their own protection, which is valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own views or insecurities. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own boundaries and wanting to protect their business. However, the situation might require more discussion to align their expectations. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), because the author is not wrong for wanting a prenup to secure their assets, especially given their family history and financial situation. It's a personal decision and a common legal measure.\n"
