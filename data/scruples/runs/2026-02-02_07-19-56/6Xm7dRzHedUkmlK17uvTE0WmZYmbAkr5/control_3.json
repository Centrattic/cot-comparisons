I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who doesn't want to get married without a prenup, and his girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy has built a successful business, has trust issues from his parents' marriage, and is considering a prenup for security. He's not necessarily against marriage but wants the prenup. His girlfriend feels insulted and hurt, interpreting it as distrust. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. Legally, a prenup is a standard tool for financial protection in case of divorce. It's common in marriages where one or both partners have significant assets, which fits the guy's situation. The fact that he's open to marriage but wants a prenup shows he's thinking about practical aspects, not just distrust.\n\nEmotionally, his girlfriend might feel that a prenup implies he doesn't trust her, but he's explaining it's for his own security. Trust issues from his family background are valid. However, communication might be a problem here. Maybe he didn't present the prenup idea in a way that reassured her. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's being honest about his needs and the prenup is a reasonable request, then no. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, which is understandable, but that doesn't make his position wrong. The guy isn't denying the possibility of marriage but is setting conditions for his protection. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
