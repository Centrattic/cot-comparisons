I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wants a prenup before marriage is in the wrong. The user provided the scenario where the author has a successful business and a history of family issues, leading to trust problems. The girlfriend is upset about the mention of a prenup and not wanting to get married.\n\nFirst, prenups are legal documents that outline financial terms in case of divorce. They're common in many marriages, especially when one or both partners have significant assets. The author's stance is about protecting their business and financial security, which is a valid concern. Given their family background, the author's hesitation towards marriage and need for a prenup could stem from personal experiences and not necessarily distrust of their partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels hurt and insulted. It's possible she views the prenup as a lack of trust, even though the author clarifies it's about security. Communication is key here. If the author tried to explain their reasoning without success, maybe there's a gap in understanding or differing values.\n\nHowever, the core issue is whether the author is wrong. The author's position is about practicality and personal history. A prenup doesn't automatically mean mistrust; it's more about legal and financial protection. The author isn't refusing marriage because of distrust but because they want to ensure their assets are protected. \n\nThe girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their security. It's a matter of differing perspectives on marriage. The author's right to set boundaries for themselves is important. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
