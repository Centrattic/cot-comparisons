I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old guy who owns a successful business earning over $150k a year. He's been with his girlfriend for three years, living together for 1.5 years. He doesn't want to get married without a prenup. His reasons include his parents' failed marriage with constant conflict, trust issues, and he never saw marriage as necessary. When he mentioned wanting a prenup if they married, his girlfriend was upset, calling him a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt. The author argues it's about security, not distrust in her specifically.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's stance is based on personal history and financial protection. The girlfriend felt insulted and hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around marriage and prenups. Prenups are becoming more common, especially for people with significant assets or businesses. The author has built a successful business, so protecting that makes sense legally. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she might view the prenup as a lack of trust, even if the author clarifies it's for security. Communication is key here; the author tried to explain it's not about her but about his own history and financial protection.\n\nBut is he wrong? Legally, he's not in the wrong for wanting a prenup. Emotionally, it's possible the way he presented it might have been hurtful, but if he's been honest from the start, that's fair. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because proposing marriage with a prenup can be seen as a red flag by some, even if the intent is practical. However, the author isn't the asshole just for wanting a prenup. The issue is more about differing expectations and how they handle communication. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his financial security based on his family's history. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having his own reasons. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
