I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting a prenup before marriage. The situation is that the author, who owns a successful business, has trust issues due to his parents' failed marriage. He told his girlfriend that he's unsure about getting married and if he does, he wants a prenup. She took it badly, feeling insulted and hurt. The question is whether the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author has a valid reason for wanting a prenup\u2014his business is valuable, and he's seen how his parents' marriage ended with conflict. A prenup can protect each party's assets, especially if there's a divorce. It's a common financial precaution in many marriages. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted, possibly interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust in the relationship.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for suggesting a prenup. Legally, prenups are standard in many high-asset relationships. They don't necessarily indicate distrust in the relationship itself but rather a practical approach to financial matters. The author's trust issues stem from his family background, which is a personal history, not a reflection on his current partner. However, communication is key here. The way he presented the prenup idea might have been a shock to his girlfriend, who might not have considered it because she comes from a different perspective or has different values.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she might not be ready for a prenup, which could indicate that she's not comfortable with the level of financial discussion or the implications of a prenup in their relationship. If she's unwilling to discuss it, that's a valid point. But the author's desire for a prenup is reasonable given his circumstances.\n\nHowever, the author's stance on marriage itself is another angle. He says he's unsure about getting married. If he's not committed to marriage, then wanting a prenup might be a red flag for her, as it could imply he's already planning for a divorce. But the author clarifies that it's about security, not distrust of her. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while prenups are becoming more accepted, some people still view them as a sign of potential divorce rather than a practical safeguard. The girlfriend might feel that the prenup is a betrayal of the idealistic view of marriage. The author's trust issues might also make communication about such a sensitive topic more challenging.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. He's not in the wrong for wanting a prenup due to his personal circumstances and financial assets. It's a responsible decision. However, the way he communicated it might have been insensitive if he didn't consider her feelings or if he brought it up without prior discussion. The key is whether both parties can find a middle ground. If the girlfriend is unwilling to even consider a prenup, that might indicate a fundamental disagreement about the nature of marriage, which could be a bigger issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup. It's a practical step given his background and assets. However, the situation highlights a significant difference in perspectives between him and his girlfriend. The responsibility isn't entirely on the author; both need to communicate better and possibly seek counseling to resolve their differing views on marriage and financial security.\n"
