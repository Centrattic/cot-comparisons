I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let's start by breaking down the details given.\n\nThe author owns a business making over $150k a year, built from scratch. Their family's marriages have been problematic, with parents who constantly tried to undermine each other. This has led to deep trust issues. The author has been in a 3-year relationship with their girlfriend, living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author expressed uncertainty about wanting to get married and mentioned wanting a prenup if they did. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling the author a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt and insulted. The author tried to explain it's about security and their family background, but she wasn't receptive. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms around prenups. In many places, prenups are legal and often recommended for individuals with significant assets to protect them in case of divorce. The author's business is a substantial asset, so wanting a prenup might be a practical decision. Legally, there's no wrongdoing in wanting a prenup; it's a common practice.\n\nEmotionally, though, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend didn't accept it. This points to a communication issue rather than a moral wrong. The author's past with their parents might contribute to their desire for a prenup, stemming from a lack of trust in marriage's stability. However, the girlfriend might see the prenup as a lack of trust in her, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting a prenup? Legally and financially, no. It's a responsible move to protect their assets. Emotionally, it's possible the author didn't communicate their reasoning effectively or the girlfriend felt disrespected. But the act of wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. The situation is more about differing values and expectations. The author isn't obliging the girlfriend to agree, but they should respect her feelings and work on mutual understanding. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is within their rights to request a prenup, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for discussion about communication and emotional impact.\n"
