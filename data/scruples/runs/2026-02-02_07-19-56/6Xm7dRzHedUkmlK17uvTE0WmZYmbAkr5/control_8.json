I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a 27-year-old who owns a successful business making over $150k a year. They've been in a 3-year relationship with their girlfriend, 26, and have been living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author expressed uncertainty about wanting to get married and mentioned wanting a prenuptial agreement if they did. The girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling insulted and hurt, and the author is now asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. They have trust issues stemming from their parents' troubled marriage, where there was constant manipulation and betrayal. They built their business from scratch, which is a significant asset. Their desire for a prenup is likely about protecting their financial future, not distrust of their partner. They emphasized that it's about security, not a lack of trust in their girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. Her reaction suggests that she might have expected marriage without a prenup and felt disrespected by the suggestion. It's possible she interpreted the prenup as a sign that the author doesn't fully commit or trust the relationship. In many cultures, marriage is seen as a lifelong commitment, and a prenup might be seen as planning for the worst, which can be emotionally hurtful even if it's a practical measure.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Legally and financially, wanting a prenup is a reasonable step, especially when one partner has substantial assets. It's a way to protect both parties in case of separation, not just the one initiating the prenup. The author's trust issues are part of their personal history and might influence their decisions, but they're trying to work on those issues. However, communication is key in relationships. The author might need to better explain that the prenup is about financial planning, not distrust. But does that make them wrong? Not necessarily. However, if the girlfriend felt disrespected and the author didn't adequately address her feelings, maybe there's a lack of emotional consideration.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could be valid if she felt the prenup was introduced without proper discussion or empathy. Relationships require compromise. The author's stance is practical, but the girlfriend's emotional reaction is also valid. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on how they approached the conversation. If they were dismissive of her feelings, that's a problem. If they tried to explain but she was unwilling to listen, it's a communication breakdown on both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given their background and assets. However, the way the conversation was handled might have contributed to the conflict. The right answer is B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup based on their circumstances, even though the situation requires better communication from both sides.\n"
