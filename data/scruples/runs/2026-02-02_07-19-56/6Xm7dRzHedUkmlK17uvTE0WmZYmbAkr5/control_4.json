I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author not wanting to get married without a prenuptial agreement, which led to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is 27, owns a successful business making over $150k annually, and has trust issues due to his parents' troubled marriage. He's been in a 3-year relationship with a 26-year-old girlfriend. When discussing marriage, he expressed uncertainty about getting married and mentioned wanting a prenup if he did. His girlfriend was upset, feeling insulted and hurt. \n\nThe key points here are his reasons for wanting a prenup and his trust issues. The author explains that his stance isn't about distrust towards his girlfriend but about personal security, given his family history. Legally, prenups are common and serve to outline financial terms in case of divorce, which can be practical, especially for someone with significant assets like a business. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a proactive step to protect one's assets, which is a valid consideration. Emotionally, the girlfriend felt hurt, interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust. The author tried to clarify that it's about security, not distrust, which is reasonable. However, communication might have been an issue. The way he presented the prenup could have been insensitive, especially if it was introduced without context or during a vulnerable moment.\n\nIn relationships, differing values and expectations can lead to conflict. The author's perspective is rooted in his experiences and practicality, while the girlfriend's reaction stems from emotional hurt. Neither side is entirely right or wrong. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" \n\nConsidering societal norms, there's a growing acceptance of prenups as practical tools rather than signs of distrust. The author's reasons are legitimate. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also valid; marriage is often seen as a symbol of trust and commitment, and a prenup can feel like a lack of faith in the relationship's future. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given his background and assets. The conflict arises more from differing perspectives on marriage and trust rather than one party being inherently at fault. It's a communication issue rather than a moral wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's taking a practical approach based on his experiences and assets, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but that doesn't make him the asshole here.\n"
