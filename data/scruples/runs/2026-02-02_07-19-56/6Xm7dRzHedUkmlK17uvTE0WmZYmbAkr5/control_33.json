I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author owns a successful business, making over $150k a year. They come from a family with a history of a troubled marriage, where trust was an issue. They mention having deep-seated trust issues from that. They've been in a three-year relationship with their girlfriend, living together for 1.5 years. When discussing marriage, the author expressed uncertainty about wanting to marry but if they do, a prenup is necessary. The girlfriend reacted negatively, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, prenups are practical, especially for someone with significant assets. They protect both parties in case of divorce, which can be financially devastating. The author's stance could be seen as responsible, especially given their background and the potential for conflict in their family. They're also trying to work on trust issues, which is a positive step. The prenup isn't about distrust in the relationship but about financial security.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and insulted. Marriage is a big step, and some people see a prenup as a lack of trust or commitment. The author's hesitation about marriage itself might have added to the girlfriend's feelings of rejection. She might have expected a more enthusiastic approach to marriage, especially after three years together. However, the author is clear that the prenup is for their own security, not a reflection on the girlfriend's trustworthiness.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, prenups are becoming more accepted, especially among those with significant assets or businesses. The author's perspective is pragmatic. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt personally attacked, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their financial interests. The key here is whether the author's request for a prenup is reasonable. Since the author has a business and given their family history, it's understandable. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are real, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for wanting to protect their assets.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is taking responsible steps to protect their financial future and has valid reasons based on family history and personal experiences. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting a prenup.\n"
