I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author built a successful business earning over $150k a year. They come from a family where their parents' marriage was full of conflict and distrust. This background has led them to have trust issues, even though they're working on it. They don't see marriage as a necessity and are hesitant to get married without a prenup. Their girlfriend, who's 26, got upset when he mentioned wanting a prenup and the possibility of not getting married. She felt insulted and hurt, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, prenups are common and often recommended, especially when one partner has significant assets. The author's concern for financial security makes sense, especially given their family history. However, the emotional aspect is important too. The girlfriend felt hurt and insulted, which suggests that the way the author communicated their feelings might have been a problem. The author tried to explain it's about security, not distrust, but the girlfriend perceived it as a lack of trust in her.\n\nThe key points here are the author's valid reasons for wanting a prenup and the way they presented it. If they approached the conversation with empathy and explained their reasoning clearly, maybe the reaction would be different. But the girlfriend's emotional response indicates that the author might not have considered her feelings adequately. So while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, the manner of communication might be an issue. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Since wanting a prenup is a reasonable precaution, especially given their circumstances, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong. The conflict arises more from communication style than the decision itself.\n"
