I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author owns a business making $150k+ a year, built from scratch. They have trust issues from their parents' failed marriage. They told their girlfriend they're unsure about marriage and would want a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about protecting their assets, which is common nowadays. Prenups are legal documents that can protect individuals, especially if they have significant assets. The author's background with their parents' toxic relationship might contribute to their desire for a prenup, even if they don't trust their partner. They mention trying to work on trust issues, so it's not necessarily about distrust of their girlfriend but maybe a precaution based on past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is hurt and feels insulted. Marriage is a big commitment, and for some people, a prenup can feel like a lack of trust or a setup for potential divorce. The author's hesitation about marriage in general might be a deal-breaker for her. Emotional reactions are valid here; if someone feels that their partner isn't committed to a lifelong partnership, it can be really upsetting.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. Legally and practically, having a prenup is a responsible decision, especially when there's significant assets involved. It's a way to outline expectations and protect both parties. However, the emotional aspect is crucial. The author's communication might have been a trigger for the girlfriend. Maybe there's a disconnect between the practical need for a prenup and the emotional significance she attaches to marriage.\n\nThe key points are: the author's valid concern about asset protection, the girlfriend's emotional response, and the communication breakdown. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting a prenup. Legally, no, but emotionally, it's a sensitive issue. The answer might depend on societal norms and relationship expectations. In some views, wanting a prenup is wise; in others, it's seen as not fully trusting the partner. \n\nSince the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess. If the author is being reasonable and the girlfriend is overreacting, maybe not. But if the author's stance is causing unnecessary hurt without a valid reason, that's different. However, given the author's business and family history, their stance is understandable. The girlfriend might need to consider the author's perspective, but the author should also consider her feelings. It's a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a practical decision based on their circumstances. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
