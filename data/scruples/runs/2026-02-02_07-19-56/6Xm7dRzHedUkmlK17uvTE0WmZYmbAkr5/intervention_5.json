I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old guy who has a successful business making over $150k a year. He comes from a family where his parents' marriage was problematic, full of distrust and manipulation. He has trust issues because of that. He's been in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend, 26, and they've been living together for 1.5 years. When they discussed marriage, he mentioned he wasn't sure about getting married and would want a prenup if he did. His girlfriend was upset, calling him a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt that he might never want to get married. He tried to explain it's about security, but she didn't accept that. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's at fault here. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he has a successful business and wants to protect his assets. Prenups are legal documents that outline how assets would be divided in case of divorce. That's a common reason people get prenups, especially if one partner has significant assets. He also mentions his family's history of distrust and his own trust issues. So he's not against marriage, but he wants to have a prenup if they do get married. \n\nHis girlfriend's reaction is that she felt insulted and hurt. She might see the prenup as a lack of trust in the marriage, which can be a sensitive topic. The author tried to explain it's for security, but she didn't accept the reasoning. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. Is wanting a prenup a reasonable request? In many ways, yes. Prenups are practical for asset protection, especially when one partner has significant property or income. It's a proactive step to avoid future conflicts. However, the way it was communicated might be an issue. If he brought it up without considering her feelings, maybe he didn't frame it in a way that reassured her. \n\nBut the core issue is that he's being honest about his needs. He's not saying he doesn't love her or doesn't want to get married; he's just cautious due to his upbringing and financial situation. On the other hand, his girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel that the prenup request signals a lack of commitment or trust, which is a big deal in a marriage proposal.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a matter of perspective. Legally and practically, prenups are a standard tool. Emotionally, it's a sensitive topic. The problem might be that they have different expectations about marriage. The author is prioritizing his financial security based on his past, while she sees marriage as a union that shouldn't need such a contract. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a prenup, especially given his background and financial situation. However, he might not have communicated his reasoning effectively, leading to her feeling hurt. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could be No (B), because wanting a prenup is a legitimate request, and he's being honest about his needs. However, some might argue that insisting on a prenup in a relationship can be seen as distrustful, even if that's not the intent. But given the context, his reasons are valid. So I think the answer is B.\n"
