I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a successful business and a high income. Their family's marriages were problematic, leading to trust issues. They're in a 3-year relationship, living together, and the girlfriend was upset when he mentioned not wanting marriage unless there's a prenup. She felt insulted and hurt.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about financial security and past family experiences. The girlfriend, on the other hand, saw it as a lack of trust. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives. \n\nMarriage and prenups can be sensitive topics. Some people view prenups as practical, especially for those with significant assets. Others might see it as a lack of commitment or trust. The author's background with family issues might justify their cautious approach. However, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that she values the symbolic aspect of marriage more, without legal safeguards.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal values here. In some cultures, prenups are common and expected, while in others, they're seen as distrustful. The key is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since he's protecting his assets (which he built himself) and has valid reasons from his upbringing, it's reasonable. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid too, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether prioritizing financial security with a prenup is justifiable. Given the author's circumstances, it seems justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
