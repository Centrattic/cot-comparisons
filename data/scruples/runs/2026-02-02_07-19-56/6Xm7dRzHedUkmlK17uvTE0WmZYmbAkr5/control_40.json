I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is that the author has a successful business, trust issues from their parents' bad marriage, and wants a prenup. The girlfriend got upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons are about personal security, not distrust of their partner. They also mention their family background and trust issues. Wanting a prenup isn't necessarily about distrust but legal protection, especially when one has significant assets. \n\nIn many cases, having a prenup is a practical step, especially if one party has a business or substantial assets. It's about protecting both parties in case of a divorce, not implying a lack of commitment to the marriage. The author is upfront about their stance, which seems reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that a prenup is a sign of not fully committing, but the author's perspective is more about security.\n\nLegally, prenups are common and encouraged in some situations. Emotionally, it's about communication. The author tried to explain their reasoning, so they're not being secretive. The girlfriend might need time to process, but wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. The author isn't avoiding marriage; they're just cautious. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
