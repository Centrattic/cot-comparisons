I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author owns a successful business, has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage, and doesn't see marriage as necessary. When discussing marriage with his girlfriend, he mentions wanting a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend reacts negatively, feeling insulted and hurt. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's reasons for wanting a prenup. He's not against marriage entirely, but he wants financial security, which is a common reason for prenups. His trust issues stem from his parents' experiences, so it's not necessarily about distrusting his current partner. Prenups are legal documents that can protect both parties' assets, especially if they have separate financial histories or different life goals.\n\nBut the girlfriend is upset because she interprets the prenup as a lack of trust. That's a valid emotional response. Marriage is often seen as a commitment without such legalities, so bringing up a prenup might feel like a red flag to her. However, the author is being upfront about his needs and concerns. It's important in relationships to communicate such things early to avoid future conflicts.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, some people view prenups as practical, while others see them as distrustful. Legally, prenups are recognized in many places as a way to protect assets. The author's stance isn't inherently wrong; he's prioritizing his own financial security based on his background. However, the way the conversation went down might have been rough. He should have explained his reasoning more clearly and been prepared for her reaction.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his needs and the prenup is a mutual decision, then it's not his fault. However, if he dismissed her feelings without trying to understand her perspective, that could be an issue. The scenario says he tried to explain it's about security, not her, but she wouldn't listen. So maybe the problem is her reaction, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting a prenup. It's more about differing values and how they handle conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a prenup. It's a personal choice based on his experiences and financial situation. The conflict arises from differing expectations and emotional reactions, not necessarily from one party being at fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
