I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author owns a business making $150k+ a year, built from scratch, and has trust issues from his parents' failed marriage. His girlfriend is upset because he mentioned wanting a prenup and being unsure about marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has financial assets and a successful business. A prenup is a legal document that outlines the division of assets in case of divorce. The girlfriend feels hurt and insulted by the prenup suggestion. The author argues it's about security, not distrust.\n\nIn many cultures, marriage is seen as a commitment, and a prenup might be viewed as a lack of trust. However, from a legal and financial standpoint, a prenup can protect both parties. The author's background with family issues might contribute to his perspective. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see marriage as a symbol of trust and commitment, and the prenup as a red flag.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's about differing expectations. The author is being honest about his needs and concerns. The girlfriend is reacting emotionally to that honesty. Neither might be in the wrong, but it's causing conflict. The question is whether not wanting to get married without a prenup is unreasonable.\n\nSome might say the author is being practical and responsible, while others might see it as a lack of commitment. The girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The answer depends on societal norms, personal values, and the context of their relationship. Since the author is upfront and explains his reasons, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The issue might be more about compatibility in their views on marriage and financial planning. So I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
