I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup.\n\nFirst, the author has built a successful business and has a family history of unsuccessful marriages with trust issues. They mention considering a prenup if they ever do get married. The girlfriend was upset, feeling insulted and hurt.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, wanting a prenup is about financial security and personal history. Prenups are legal documents that can protect both parties in case of divorce, so it's a practical consideration. The author's hesitation about marriage itself might stem from their family's experiences, which isn't uncommon.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt and seen as untrustworthy. Marriage is a big commitment, and some people might view a prenup as a lack of trust, even if that's not the case. The author did explain it's for security, not distrust, but communication can be challenging in such situations.\n\nLegally, prenups are valid in many places and are meant to outline asset division before marriage. The author isn't legally wrong for wanting one. Emotionally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid too; she might feel the prenup implies a lack of confidence in the marriage's success.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since they're asking for a prenup for financial protection, which is a legitimate reason, and considering their personal history, it's not necessarily wrong. The conflict arises more from differing expectations and emotional reactions rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because wanting a prenup is a reasonable and responsible decision given their circumstances.\n"
