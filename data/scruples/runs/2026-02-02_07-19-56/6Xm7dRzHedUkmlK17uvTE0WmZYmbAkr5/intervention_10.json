I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author has a successful business, trust issues from their parents' marriage, and wants a prenup if they ever get married. The girlfriend got upset, called him a distrustful asshole, and felt hurt. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: they built a business from scratch, have trust issues due to family history, and see marriage not as a necessity. They think a prenup is about financial security, not distrust of their partner. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels insulted and hurt, interpreting the prenup as a lack of trust in their relationship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Prenups can be practical for protecting assets, especially if one partner has significant assets or a business. The author's background with their parents' problematic marriage might contribute to their cautious approach. However, the way they communicated this might have been an issue. If they presented it without considering their partner's feelings or if it came across as dismissive, that could hurt her.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. It's a matter of perspective. The author isn't being unreasonable to want financial protection. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling hurt and untrusted, but the author's stance is based on personal history and financial prudence. Neither is entirely right or wrong. However, in the context of a relationship, communication is key. If the author approached the topic without considering how it might affect their partner emotionally, that's a mistake. But wanting a prenup itself isn't the issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is more nuanced. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because wanting a prenup is a reasonable decision, especially given their circumstances. The problem might lie in how it was communicated rather than the desire itself.\n"
