  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to get married without a prenup?\nA little background:  I own a business earning $150k+ a year that I built from the ground up. I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The situation is about a guy who owns a successful business and has trust issues due to his parents' troubled marriage. He told his girlfriend he might want a prenup if they ever married, and she got really upset, thinking he doesn't trust her. Now they're arguing about it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective: he's built his business from scratch, has trust issues from his family, and sees marriage as unnecessary. He's not against marriage but wants a prenup for security. His reasoning is about protecting his assets and personal history.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and insulted. She might see a prenup as a lack of trust in their relationship. Maybe she expected marriage to be a partnership without legal safeguards, which could indicate she has different expectations about marriage. Her reaction is emotional, which is understandable if she felt disrespected.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical step for financial protection, especially when someone has significant assets. However, the way he communicated it might have been an issue. If he focused on his own security without considering her feelings, that could be a problem. But the question is whether he's at fault for wanting a prenup, not how he presented it.\n\nIn many cases, prenups are seen as responsible, especially when there are businesses or substantial assets. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from different views on marriage\u2014she might prioritize emotional security over legal/financial ones. But that doesn't mean he's wrong for having a different perspective. It's more about differing expectations. The author isn't being disrespectful per se; he's advocating for his own interests. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
