I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is at fault for not wanting to get married without a prenup. The author built a business, has trust issues from family experiences, and wants a prenup if they do get married. The girlfriend is upset, feeling insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: wanting a prenup is about financial security, not distrust. They have valid reasons based on family history. Prenups are legal documents that can protect assets, especially if they have a business. It's common in many relationships to have a prenup, especially when there's significant wealth involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and insulted. She might view the prenup as a lack of commitment or trust. Marriage is a big step, and some people might see a prenup as undermining the trust required for marriage. The author's hesitation to marry without it could make her feel uncertain about the future.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's right to protect their assets versus the girlfriend's feelings. Prenups are legal and often used to prevent future conflicts. The author is not forcing the marriage, just setting conditions. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's stance is practical. \n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend didn't accept it. The issue here might be more about their differing views on marriage and trust rather than the prenup itself. The author isn't wrong for wanting a prenup; it's a personal choice based on their experiences. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing their financial security.\n"
