I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \n\n\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to get married without a prenup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author owns a successful business, making over $150k a year. They come from a family where their parents' marriage was full of distrust and manipulation. This has led to trust issues for the author, who's now in a three-year relationship with a 26-year-old girlfriend. When discussing marriage, the author mentions not being sure about getting married and wanting a prenup if they do. The girlfriend is upset, calling the author a distrustful asshole and feeling hurt. The author tries to explain it's about security, not distrust, but she won't hear it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, wanting a prenup is a common practice, especially when someone has significant assets. It's about protecting both parties in case of a divorce. The author's background with their parents' failed marriage might justify their cautious approach. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt insulted and hurt, which suggests that the author's approach might have been insensitive. The way the author communicated their stance could have been better. Instead of causing conflict, maybe addressing the issue earlier or finding a way to reassure the girlfriend about their intentions.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the reasons for wanting a prenup and how it was communicated. Legally, it's entirely reasonable to have a prenup, especially when one partner has substantial assets. The author isn't refusing marriage because they don't trust their partner; they're cautious due to their upbringing. However, the girlfriend might feel that the prenup implies a lack of trust or commitment. The author's explanation about security might not be enough if it's presented without empathy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The author isn't wrong for wanting a prenup, but maybe the way they approached the conversation could be improved. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which is a judgment call. Since the author had valid reasons and it's not uncommon to have a prenup, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the communication was hurtful, that's a different aspect. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the communication style. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the desire for a prenup is reasonable, even if the delivery could be better.\n"
