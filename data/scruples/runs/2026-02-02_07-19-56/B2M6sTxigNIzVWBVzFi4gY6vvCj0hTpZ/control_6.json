It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the story is about someone trying to take their dog to a dog park, but they're denied entry by a woman who says it's closed for an event. The author then gets angry, uses a curse word, and causes the park to be closed by calling park rangers. The main question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dog park was closed for an event, which the author wasn't aware of. The woman at the gate prevented entry, but the author tried to go in anyway. The argument escalates, leading to the use of a derogatory term. Then the author calls park rangers, which results in the park being closed for maintenance. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the first issue is whether the park was actually closed. The user mentioned it's a county-run park, and the woman said it's closed for an event by the Labradoodle Association. If the park was indeed closed for an event, then the author was technically not allowed in. However, the park isn't usually closed except for maintenance or official use, so maybe the couple was holding a private event without proper authorization. The park rangers later showed up, implying that maybe the closure wasn't legitimate.\n\nNext, the author's actions: They entered the park after being told it's closed, leading to a confrontation. When told to leave after 10 minutes, they used a harsh insult. The woman's husband threatened them, and the author then called the park rangers, leading to the park's closure. The author's defense is that they wanted their dog to play, were frustrated by the weather, and maybe the couple was being inconsiderate by hosting a private event.\n\nBut from a legal perspective, if the park was closed for an event, the author was trespassing. Even if the closure wasn't official, the people there might have believed it was closed. The author's use of a curse word was definitely inconsiderate and could be seen as rude or aggressive. However, if the closure was illegitimate, the author might have had a point in bringing in park rangers to check.\n\nThe park ending up closed might have been a collateral consequence that affected others, which the author now feels guilty about. The key is whether the author had the right to enter. If the park wasn't officially closed, the author had a right to be there and the couple was blocking access. But if it was a legitimate closure, the author trespassed. The park rangers' involvement suggests the closure wasn't official, so maybe the author was justified in calling them. However, the way the author reacted with the curse words is definitely a problem.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, the author shouldn't have used that language. Even if the couple was wrong, responding with a curse word is unprofessional and could escalate the situation. The author's actions led to a larger issue, affecting other people. So while there might be some justification for the author's frustration, their response was inappropriate, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nThe answer likely is A (the author is in the wrong) because they entered a closed park, had a confrontational argument, and used offensive language. Even if the closure was illegitimate, the way they handled it was poor. The park rangers' involvement might have been necessary, but the author's choice of words was definitely inconsiderate and contributed to the problem.\n"
