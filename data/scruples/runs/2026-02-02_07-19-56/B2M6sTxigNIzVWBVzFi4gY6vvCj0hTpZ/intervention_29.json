It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog park closure and a confrontation. \n\nFirst, the author went to the dog park, which was supposed to be open. However, upon arrival, they were told it was closed for an event by a woman named Rachel. The author refused to leave and argued, leading to a conflict. The woman then allowed them in for 10 minutes, but the author yelled an insult when time was up. Then they called the park rangers, resulting in the park being closed for maintenance, which affected others.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the park was closed for an event, the author was told to leave but stayed, then insulted Rachel, and then called the rangers, leading to the closure. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, was the park actually closed? The story mentions that the park was closed for an event by the County Labradoodle Association. If the park was indeed closed, then the author was on private property or unauthorized area. Even if the park is usually open, if it was closed for an event, entry might be restricted. So, the author might have been trespassing.\n\nNext, the confrontation: the woman blocked the gate, and the author laughed and said \"no thank you.\" Then, when the husband came, they argued. The author's dog was whining, but the author could have left. Instead, they stayed despite being told to leave. That's a point against the author.\n\nThen, the author was allowed in for 10 minutes. But when the time was up, they insulted Rachel. Using a derogatory term towards a woman is a clear issue. That's a major misstep. Even if frustrated, name-calling is not acceptable, especially towards a woman.\n\nCalling the park rangers after the incident led to the park's closure. The author might have done this to retaliate or to enforce the closure, but the result was other people being inconvenienced. The author seems to feel guilty about that, but still, initiating the closure could be seen as taking matters into their own hands.\n\nNow, considering the other side: Rachel and her husband organized the event. If the park was closed for their event, others might not have been allowed in. The author's presence could disrupt their event. However, the park is a public space, so unless there's a legal closure notice, the event organizers might not have the authority to block entry. But if the park was officially closed by the county, then the author was trespassing.\n\nThe author's actions: staying after being told to leave, using a vulgar term, then calling the rangers. All these steps are problematic. Even if the author felt wronged, the response was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for entering a closed park, refusing to leave after being asked, using a derogatory term, and causing a closure that affected others. The correct answer is A.\n"
