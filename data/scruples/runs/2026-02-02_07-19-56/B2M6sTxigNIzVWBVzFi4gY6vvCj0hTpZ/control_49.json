It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict at a dog park. The author wanted to bring their 60-pound German Shorthaired Pointer to the park to relieve cabin fever after a few days of bad weather. They arrived to find the park closed for an event by the Labradoodle Association, but a lady (Rachel) and her husband wouldn't let them in. The author initially refused to go to the small dog area, leading to some argument. Rachel physically blocked the gate, and after some back and forth, the author was allowed in for 10 minutes. When the time was up, the author yelled a profane comment, leading to a confrontation. The park rangers later closed the park due to reports of the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was in the wrong. The park was closed for an event, which might mean it wasn't officially closed by the county, but rather a private event. If the park is county-run and they only close it for maintenance or county use, but this event was organized by a third party (the Labradoodle Association), that might be a problem. However, the key issue is whether the author had a right to be there. If the event was happening, even if the park isn't officially closed, the organizers might have a claim to the space. The author's refusal to comply with the closure could be seen as trespassing or causing a disruption.\n\nThe author's actions escalate when they use profanity towards Rachel, which is clearly inappropriate and disrespectful. That's a clear wrong. Also, the fact that the park rangers closed the park after the author's call suggests there was some official issue, maybe the event wasn't properly sanctioned. However, the author contributed to the problem by being confrontational and using a slur. Even if they felt wronged, yelling at another person is not acceptable. The author's initial refusal to leave the small dog area (which might not be suitable for their large dog) could be seen as a point of contention, but the real issue is the verbal confrontation and causing the park to close. The author's actions led to unintended consequences for other people. So, the author is at least partially in the wrong for their verbal outburst and contributing to the closure. Answer A.\n"
