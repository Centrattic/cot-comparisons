It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog park conflict. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person went to a dog park that's usually open unless closed by the county. They found it closed for an event by the Labradoodle Association. The woman there wouldn't let them in initially, but after some back and forth, they were allowed in for 10 minutes. The author then yelled an insult and later called the park rangers, leading to the park being closed for maintenance. Now, they're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: unauthorized closure of a public park, conflict with another person, and the author's response. Let me check the facts again. The park was supposed to be open unless closed by the county. The couple was hosting an event there. The woman blocked the gate and forced others to leave, but then allowed the author in for 10 minutes. The author's dog was large, so the small dog area wasn't appropriate. \n\nThe author's actions: they refused to leave after 10 minutes, swore at the woman, and then called park rangers to report the incident. The rangers came and closed the park. The author feels bad because others' outings were ruined.\n\nNow, was the closure of the park legal? If the county didn't close it, but a private group did, that's a problem. Public parks are public, so unless the county has given permission for private events, the group can't close it. The woman and her husband might have been in the wrong by taking over the park for their event. The author was within their rights to use the park unless it was officially closed by the county.\n\nThe author's response: swearing was inappropriate, especially directing a slur at a woman. That's a clear transgression. However, the initial conflict was due to the couple's unauthorized closure. The author then escalated by calling the authorities, which led to the park being closed for maintenance. Did they know the park wasn't really under maintenance? The rangers came after the author's report and closed it. If the closure was due to the report, maybe the author's action was a form of retaliation, which could be wrong. But if the park rangers confirmed that the park was closed for maintenance, perhaps the closure was legitimate. Wait, the rangers said they received two other calls about people being turned away. So there might have been prior complaints, making the group's actions illegal. The author's report might have been valid, leading to the park being closed properly.\n\nSo the author's wrongdoings: using a slur and swearing, which is never acceptable. The rest\u2014refusing to leave after being allowed in for 10 minutes\u2014could be seen as self-defense if they were in their right to be there. The couple was likely the ones in the wrong by blocking access to the public park. The author's call to park rangers was a valid action if the group was indeed misusing the park's space. However, the initial response of swearing was misplaced. So the author is partially at fault for the verbal abuse but not necessarily for the rest. The question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. If the main issue is the swear word, then yes, they are in the wrong for that. But the context of the couple's unauthorized closure complicates it. The answer would depend on whether the swear word and subsequent actions are considered the author's fault. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering both the swear word and the report leading to closure, the answer might be A (Yes), because the author did say something inappropriate, even if the other party had issues. But the larger issue is the couple's actions. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So the answer is A.\n"
