It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dog park incident. The person went to the park expecting it to be open, but another couple claimed it was closed for an event. There was some conflict, the person got angry, used a derogatory term, and then called the park rangers, leading to the park being closed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The park was county-run and usually only closed for maintenance or county use. The hosts said it was closed for an event by their association. The main issue is whether the park was actually closed. The user called the park rangers, who confirmed they got two other calls about people being turned away, leading them to shut it down for \"maintenance.\" So maybe the closure wasn't official.\n\nThe person in question got angry and used a curse word. That's a clear mistake. Even if they felt wronged, using such language is unprofessional and could escalate the situation. Then, they called the park rangers, which might have been a way to take action, but it backfired because the rangers closed the park, affecting others.\n\nOn the other hand, the hosts might have been hosting an unauthorized event, which is also problematic. If the park wasn't officially closed, they had no right to block others. The person had a right to use the park if it was open. However, their reaction was impulsive and inappropriate. The main question is whether their response was justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on their actions\u2014using a derogatory term and then escalating the situation by calling the rangers. Even if the hosts were at fault, the user's response was not the best. So the answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong for their reaction.\n"
