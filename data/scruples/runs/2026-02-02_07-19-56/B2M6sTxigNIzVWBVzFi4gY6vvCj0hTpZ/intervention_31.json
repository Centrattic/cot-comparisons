It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The story is about someone who went to a dog park, was told it was closed for an event by a woman named Rachel, but decided to stay anyway. Then they had an argument, the person insulted Rachel, and the park ended up being shut down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The park was closed for an event organized by the Labradoodle Association. The person was informed of this and initially refused to leave, even when the gate was blocked. They laughed, which they say was a nervous reaction, but then continued to stay. Rachel and her husband were there for this event, which they had organized for three months. The person's dog was a large German Shorthaired Pointer, which doesn't belong in the small dog area. \n\nThen, the person was allowed in for 10 minutes. After that, Rachel told them to leave, and the person insulted her. This led to a confrontation, and the park rangers closed the park. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main points of contention are: Was the park actually closed? The author was told it was closed for an event. If the park was officially closed, then entering without permission is a problem. The woman and her husband were part of the event, so they had a right to be there. The author's dog is large, so the small dog area isn't suitable, so they might not have had a valid alternative.\n\nThe author's actions: Refusing to leave when told, blocking the gate, insulting a woman, which is a serious issue. Even if the author felt wronged, using a derogatory term is crossing a line. The confrontation led to the park being shut down, affecting others' plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman blocked the gate and was aggressive. The author might have felt frustrated, but that doesn't justify their response. The key factors here are respect for the rules and the event, the appropriateness of the dog area, and the author's response to the situation.\n\nThe author had no right to enter the park if it was closed. Even if they thought they were being unreasonable, the correct course of action would be to leave or check with the authorities. The insult was a direct attack on a person, which is unprofessional and inconsiderate. While the woman's actions were also questionable (blocking the gate, getting aggressive), the author's response was disproportionate and harmful.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for refusing to leave when the park was closed, staying despite being told to leave, and using derogatory language. Even if the event wasn't official, the author's actions led to a negative outcome for others. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
