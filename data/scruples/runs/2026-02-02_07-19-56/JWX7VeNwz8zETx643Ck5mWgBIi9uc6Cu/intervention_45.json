She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD and past trauma, including rape and abortion. The author mentions that he was just making small talk and didn't anticipate her strong reaction. He tried to explain his perspective but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma is significant, and the song's controversy relates to its lyrics being seen as non-consensual or coercive, which ties into #MeToo themes. The author's girlfriend aligns with the #MeToo stance, so bringing up this topic could naturally be sensitive. The author admits he didn't do much research beyond a quick read of an opinion piece, which might have led him to misunderstand the depth of the issue. He also acknowledges that if he had thought more, he might not have brought it up. \n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma, the sensitive nature of the song's lyrics, and the author's lack of thorough understanding before discussing it. Even if the author's intention was small talk, the topic inherently touches on issues that are very relevant to her past experiences. By not considering her history and the potential impact of the topic, he might have acted insensitively. \n\nHowever, the author did try to explain his viewpoint and later researched more to understand better. But the initial action was bringing up the topic without being aware of its emotional weight for her. In relationships, especially when a partner has trauma, it's important to be cautious about topics that might trigger them. The author's failure to recognize the sensitivity of the topic despite knowing her background could be seen as a mistake. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the action itself was a misstep. He should have been more mindful of her history and perhaps avoided the topic unless she brought it up. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider the potential impact of his words on her trauma.\n"
