She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD, including trauma from a past relationship involving rape and an abortion. The author mentioned the controversy in small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a big argument. He tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't back it up with much research beyond a quick read of an opinion piece. Now, they had a shouting match, and he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma is relevant here. The song's controversy is about consent, which could be a trigger for her given her past. The author didn't seem to consider how bringing up this topic might affect her, especially without understanding the deeper implications. He mentions he didn't do much research beyond a cursory read, which suggests he wasn't fully informed about the reasons behind the controversy. By bringing it up in a lighthearted way, he might have inadvertently dismissed her feelings or the seriousness of the issue she's dealing with. \n\nAlso, when she expressed her #MeToo aligned views, he tried to counter that the removal was excessive, which could be seen as opposing her stance. Since she has a traumatic history related to these issues, defending the song's removal as too harsh could come across as insensitive. His approach was to defend his viewpoint without acknowledging her perspective, which likely escalated the conflict. \n\nEven though he later tried to offer more information after the argument, the initial action of bringing up the topic without considering her trauma shows a lack of empathy. The key here is understanding that in relationships, especially with partners who have a history of trauma, certain topics need careful handling. The author didn't take the necessary precautions to consider her feelings and history, leading to the conflict. Therefore, he's more at fault for not being considerate enough in the first place.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
