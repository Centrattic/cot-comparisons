She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The key points here are the girlfriend's history with trauma\u2014complex PTSD, a past rape, and an abortion. The author mentions that they brought up the song's controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to discuss the song's background, possibly to share an interesting fact. However, they didn't consider the girlfriend's personal sensitivities. The song's controversy revolves around its lyrics being interpreted as non-consensual, which ties into the #MeToo movement. Given her history, this topic could be triggering. The author's initial reaction was to defend the song's removal as excessive, using a cursory opinion piece, which shows a lack of depth and consideration for her feelings.\n\nThe author did try to explain their perspective but didn't back it up with thorough research. After causing the argument, they decided to sleep on the couch and then tried to re-enter the discussion the next day with more information. However, the main issue here is that they didn't prioritize their girlfriend's emotional well-being by stepping back and apologizing first. Instead of immediately defending their point, they should have recognized the sensitivity of the topic and approached it with more empathy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable given her trauma. The author's failure to check their own biases and do proper research before bringing up such a contentious topic shows a lack of consideration. Even if they had valid points, the timing and approach were problematic. The fact that they used a casual \"small talk\" context for a potentially triggering subject without prior awareness of her history indicates negligence.\n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have experienced trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might cause distress. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, were careless. They should have been more proactive in understanding her perspective and avoiding topics that could reopen old wounds. The effort to explain their viewpoint wasn't enough to offset the initial insensitivity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking her trauma into account before bringing up the song's controversy.\n"
