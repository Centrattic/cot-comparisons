She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context mentions that she has complex PTSD from her upbringing, past relationships, including a rape and abortion. The author brought up the song's controversy in a casual conversation but ended up causing conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma. The song has been criticized for being non-consensual, which ties into the #MeToo movement. Since she has a history of being raped, this topic could be a trigger for her. The author's intention was small talk, but he didn't consider her personal experiences. He tried to argue against the controversy without enough background, which might have come off as dismissive.\n\nThe author mentions he didn't have much evidence beyond a quick read. That could be seen as not doing his homework, especially when the subject is sensitive. He also tried to explain his stance during a conflict, which might have escalated things. His approach was to push his views instead of backing down, leading to more arguments.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to express his perspective and understand her viewpoint. He's reflecting on his actions and is seeking to make amends by doing more research. But the key here is that he didn't prioritize her feelings and trauma, which is a valid concern in a relationship. Bringing up such a sensitive topic without considering her background was a misstep. He should have been more cautious and empathetic, maybe avoiding the topic altogether or discussing it in a safer context.\n\nSo, even though he had good intentions, the way he approached it was wrong. He should have been more aware of her trauma and how the subject could affect her. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
