She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, context is key. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, past relationships, including a traumatic experience. The author mentions that he just brought up the song as small talk, not expecting a strong reaction. But she took it in line with #MeToo, which likely relates to the song's lyrics being seen as coercive or non-consensual. \n\nThe author tried to explain his view that removing the song was excessive, but he didn't do much research beforehand. He later did more research and tried to discuss it again, but not before causing a conflict. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, considering his girlfriend's history, bringing up a song that has been controversial for its portrayal of consent could be triggering. Even if he had a different perspective, he should have been more aware of her sensitivities. The fact that he didn't do thorough research before discussing it shows a lack of consideration. \n\nAlso, when she reacted, he tried to argue his point instead of immediately acknowledging her feelings. That could have escalated things. Even though he later tried to reconcile with more info, the initial action was careless. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her trauma and the context of the song, leading to a conflict.\n"
