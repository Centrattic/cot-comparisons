  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for bringing up the \"Baby it's Cold Outside\" controversy with my girlfriend?\nContext: We have been together four years, and love each other very much. She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The author mentions that his girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and a past traumatic experience involving rape and an abortion. That's really important because it adds context to why this topic might be sensitive for her.\n\nThe author was making small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it turned into an \"earful\" from her. Her perspective aligns with #MeToo, which likely relates to the song's lyrics being seen as non-consensual or inappropriate. The author, on the other hand, thought the removal of the song was excessive and wanted to discuss his viewpoint. But he didn't do much research beyond an opinion piece, which led to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The girlfriend's trauma history makes this topic particularly sensitive for her. 2) The author didn't do thorough research before bringing it up, which might have been seen as insensitive. 3) He tried to explain his stance without fully understanding her perspective, leading to a conflict. 4) He didn't back down immediately, which escalated the situation.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that could trigger them. The author knew about her PTSD and past experiences, so bringing up a song that's controversial for its perceived encouragement of non-consensual behavior might not be the best choice. Even if he had a different viewpoint, not considering her feelings and not doing proper research before the discussion shows a lack of sensitivity.\n\nThe fact that he ended up on the couch and there were shouting matches suggests that his approach was hurtful. His intention might have been to discuss and understand, but the way he approached it without considering her trauma history was problematic. The #MeToo movement emphasizes consent and listening to survivors, so his initial stance against the song's removal could clash with her views, especially given her past.\n\nEven though he tried to reconcile by researching more and offering his viewpoint again, the initial act of bringing it up without proper consideration might have already caused harm. In such cases, it's important to prioritize the partner's well-being and avoid topics that could trigger their trauma unless they're comfortable discussing them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely acted inconsiderately by not taking into account his girlfriend's trauma and the sensitive nature of the topic. He should have been more cautious and empathetic, perhaps avoiding the topic altogether or approaching it with more care and preparation to understand her perspective better.\n"
