She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves bringing up the controversy around the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" with his girlfriend, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing, past relationships, including a rape and abortion. The author brought up the controversy, expecting small talk but it escalated. His stance was about the removal being excessive, which conflicts with her #MeToo views. He admits he didn't do much research and just shared his opinion, which he now realizes was a mistake.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the author's approach. He didn't consider her sensitive background before discussing a topic that could trigger her. Even though his intention was to discuss the song's history, his lack of awareness and preparation led to a harmful situation. He tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't validate her feelings first. The fact that he ended up on the couch and there was a shouting match suggests the impact was significant.\n\nIn relationships, especially when a partner has trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might trigger them. The author should have checked in with her feelings about the topic beforehand, especially knowing her history. Bringing up such a sensitive issue without proper context or understanding shows a lack of consideration for her emotional state. Even if he had a valid point, the way he approached it without prior discussion was inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's defense is that he was looking at a broader picture and enjoyed historical context, but in this case, his personal interest clashed with her emotional well-being. The fact that he later did more research and tried to explain his views again doesn't undo the initial harm. The mistake was in initiating the conversation without being fully informed and not prioritizing her feelings.\n\nTherefore, the author likely breached emotional boundaries by not being sensitive to her trauma. The answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
