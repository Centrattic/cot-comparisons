She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past rape, and an abortion. The song's controversy is related to #MeToo, which ties into issues of consent and power dynamics. The author brought it up as small talk but didn't realize how sensitive it was for her.\n\nHe tried to explain his view that removing the song was excessive, but he admits he didn't do much research beyond a quick read. The girlfriend clearly had a strong emotional reaction, which led to a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch. \n\nNow, the key points here: The author had prior knowledge of his girlfriend's trauma. He should have been more cautious about topics he brings up, especially ones that could trigger her. Even if he had his own perspective, the way he approached it\u2014without thorough understanding and without considering her feelings\u2014might have been insensitive. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. He tried to explain his viewpoint, and after the conflict, he did some more research to better understand the issue. However, the initial trigger was him bringing up a topic he knew could be sensitive. In a relationship where one partner has trauma, the other should be more attuned to avoid such triggers unless necessary. \n\nThe question is whether his actions were wrong. Given that he had the context of her trauma and still brought up a potentially triggering topic without proper consideration, it's likely he's in the wrong. Relationships require empathy and understanding, especially when one partner has a history of trauma. The author's failure to prioritize her well-being over his curiosity or need to discuss his perspective is a key factor here.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take into account her trauma and the sensitivity of the topic before bringing it up.\n"
