She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy. The situation involves the author's girlfriend who has complex PTSD, a history of rape, and an abortion. The author initiated a conversation about the song's controversy, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma history is significant. The song's controversy is tied to its perceived coercion, which aligns with #MeToo concerns. The author mentions not having done thorough research and just had a cursory read. He also tried to explain his view but didn't back it up with evidence, leading to a poor attempt at relating her perspective.\n\nThe key points here are the author's awareness of his girlfriend's trauma and whether he should have known better. Since she has a history that makes this song particularly triggering, bringing it up without proper understanding and sensitivity could be seen as insensitive. Even if he had a different viewpoint, the way he approached it without considering her feelings and without sufficient research might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, he acknowledges that if he thought for a minute, he wouldn't have brought it up. This self-awareness suggests he knew there could be issues but proceeded anyway. The result was a conflict that affected their weekend and required a shout match. His attempt to explain his stance was poorly executed, showing a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might trigger them. The author's failure to do proper research and his initial dismissiveness (relying on a gut feeling and an opinion piece) contributed to the problem. Even though he tried to make amends later, the initial action was careless.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't take into account his girlfriend's trauma history and approached a sensitive topic without sufficient care and understanding.\n"
