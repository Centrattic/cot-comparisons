She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and abortion. The author mentions that he was just making small talk and didn't anticipate her strong reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the girlfriend's trauma. People with complex PTSD often have heightened sensitivity to topics that trigger their past experiences. The song's controversy is linked to its lyrics being seen as non-consensual or coercive, which ties into #MeToo movements. Given her history, this song could be especially triggering for her.\n\nThe author brings up the topic without realizing how it might affect her. Even though he was just making small talk, he didn't consider her possible trauma related to the song's themes. He then tried to defend his stance without adequate knowledge, which could have made her feel invalidated. The fact that he only did a cursory read and relied on his gut (and an opinion piece) shows a lack of thorough understanding.\n\nHe didn't back down when she expressed her feelings but instead tried to explain his viewpoint further, which might have escalated the situation. The result was a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch. The key here is whether he should have known better given her history. Since he's aware of her PTSD and past trauma, he should have been more cautious about discussing potentially triggering topics. His failure to do so could be seen as insensitive, even if unintentional.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't have malicious intent. He was engaging in small talk and didn't foresee the reaction. However, the responsibility lies in being mindful of the other person's well-being, especially when they have known trauma. His attempt to continue the discussion without backing down might have been misguided, but his initial action of bringing it up was the main issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of bringing up a topic that's directly related to his girlfriend's trauma without considering her feelings and history makes him at fault. His subsequent actions also didn't help, but the initial mistake was not being aware of her sensitivities. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
