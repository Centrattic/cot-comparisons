She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including a rape and abortion. The author wanted to have small talk about the song's controversy but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's history with trauma is significant. The song in question has been criticized for being non-consensual, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. The author brought it up without understanding her perspective, leading to a negative reaction. \n\nThe author mentions he didn't do much research before bringing it up. He tried to explain his view but didn't have solid evidence, relying on a gut feeling and an opinion piece. This approach might have been dismissive of her feelings given her trauma. \n\nEven though the author later did more research and wanted to discuss further, the initial action of bringing up a sensitive topic without awareness of her personal history seems problematic. The key here is whether he should have known better given her background. Since he knew about her trauma, bringing up a topic that could trigger her was probably careless. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings and history when choosing the topic of conversation. It's important to be mindful of a partner's past, especially with trauma, and avoid subjects that could be triggering without prior understanding.\n"
