She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They provided the AITA scenario where the author talked about the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to past trauma, including rape and abortion. The author brought up the topic expecting small talk but ended up causing a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The girlfriend's trauma history is crucial here. The song's controversy is about consent, which ties into #MeToo. The author brought it up without considering how it might affect her. Even if they had their own reasons for thinking the removal was excessive, they didn't do their due diligence on the history or her feelings. \n\nThe author admitted they only did a cursory read and relied on their gut. That's a problem because they didn't take the time to understand the depth of the issue, especially knowing the girlfriend's background. They also tried to justify their stance but didn't consider the impact on her. The girlfriend's reaction was valid given her trauma, and the author's approach was insensitive.\n\nSo, the key points are: knowing her trauma history, bringing up a topic that's directly related to her past experiences, not doing proper research beforehand, and not being empathetic. Even if the author's intention was just small talk, the lack of awareness and consideration makes them at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
