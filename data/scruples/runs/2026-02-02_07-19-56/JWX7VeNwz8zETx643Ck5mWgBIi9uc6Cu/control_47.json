She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past relationship where she was raped, and had an abortion. That's a lot of trauma. The song in question was pulled because some people argue it's about a man pressuring a woman into staying, which is seen as non-consensual. So the #MeToo movement would definitely have a stance against that.\n\nThe author mentions he brought up the controversy in small talk. He expected casual conversation but got an emotional response from his girlfriend. He tried to defend the removal of the song as excessive, citing his own views and a quick read of an opinion piece. Then he slept on the couch, had a shouting match, and later tried to explain his views again with more research, but maybe it was too late.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's history, bringing up a topic that could trigger her PTSD was likely a mistake. Even if he had good intentions, he didn't consider her trauma enough before discussing it. The fact that he didn't do thorough research and just went off a cursory read shows a lack of thoughtfulness. \n\nAlso, when she reacted strongly, his attempt to explain his stance might have come off as dismissive of her feelings. Instead of backing down and acknowledging her pain, he tried to push his own views, which could have made her feel invalidated. That's a red flag in a relationship, especially with someone who has trauma.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The topic is sensitive and potentially triggering for her. 2) He didn't do enough research before bringing it up. 3) He didn't prioritize her feelings when she expressed distress, instead trying to justify his opinion. 4) The aftermath led to arguments and sleep on the couch, indicating significant conflict.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, you avoid topics that could harm or upset your partner, especially knowing their history. Even if he had a different viewpoint, the way he approached the conversation wasn't considerate of her emotional state. The fact that he later tried to explain himself after doing more research suggests he realized his mistake, but the initial approach was flawed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a mistake by not considering his girlfriend's trauma and bringing up a sensitive topic without proper understanding. He also didn't handle her reaction appropriately. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
