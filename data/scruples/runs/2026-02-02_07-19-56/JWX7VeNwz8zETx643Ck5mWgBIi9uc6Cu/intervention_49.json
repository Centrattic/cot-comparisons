She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD, a history of rape, and an abortion. The girlfriend's reaction was strong, aligning with #MeToo, and the author ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's background. She has complex PTSD from her upbringing and past relationships, including a traumatic experience. The song's controversy is about it being seen as non-consensual, which is a sensitive topic given her history. The author mentions he didn't do any thorough research before bringing it up, just a cursory read of an opinion piece. That shows a lack of preparation and possibly not considering how it might affect her.\n\nThe author's intention was small talk, but he didn't check if this topic was safe. Given her trauma, discussing a song that has been criticized for its content about a non-consensual situation could be triggering. The girlfriend's strong reaction makes sense in that context. The author tried to defend his stance but didn't do his homework, which might have made her feel invalidated or dismissed her feelings.\n\nHe ended up on the couch, and there's a shouting match. He admits he didn't back down and tried to explain his view again, but maybe he should have prioritized her feelings first. The key points here are the lack of consideration for her trauma, not doing proper research, and not backing down when it was clear he had upset her. \n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has a history of trauma, it's important to be sensitive to their triggers. Even if the author had his own reasons for bringing it up, he should have considered her perspective first. The fact that he continued to argue his point without apologizing might have escalated things unnecessarily. So, yes, he's in the wrong for not being mindful of her trauma and not handling the situation with care.\n"
