She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. Let me break down the context first.\n\nThe couple has been together four years and love each other. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past relationships, including a rape and abortion. The guy brought up the song controversy, expecting small talk but ended up causing a major argument. He tried to explain why he thought removing the song was excessive, using a cursory read of an opinion piece. The girlfriend's stance aligns with #MeToo. The guy ended up sleeping on the couch and there was a shouting match the next day. He tried to explain his view again with more research but it didn't go well. He feels he ruined their weekend and hates Christmas music now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy brought up a sensitive topic without considering his girlfriend's trauma, especially since she has a history of being raped and having an abortion. The song in question has been controversial for its lyrics that could be seen as non-consensual or coercive. The #MeToo movement focuses on consent and addressing sexual harassment, which the girlfriend supports.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think. When someone has a history of trauma, especially related to sexual violence, bringing up a topic that could trigger them requires a lot of sensitivity. The guy mentions he didn't do much research beyond a cursory read and didn't consider the potential impact. Even though he had good intentions to discuss and explain his viewpoint, he didn't take into account her possible trauma triggers. \n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have PTSD or similar issues, it's crucial to be aware of what topics might be triggers. The guy didn't check in with her about how she felt about the song before bringing it up. He also didn't back down when she was upset, instead trying to push his own perspective. That's probably why the situation escalated.\n\nEven if he had valid points about art and history, the way he approached it without consideration for her trauma was likely hurtful. The fact that she has a history of being raped makes the song's lyrics, which some see as non-consensual, a sensitive topic. His initial approach was thoughtless, and even when he tried to explain again later, it might have been too late because the trigger had already occurred.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). He brought up a sensitive topic without awareness of his partner's trauma and didn't handle her reaction appropriately, leading to conflict.\n"
