She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD, including trauma from a past relationship. The author mentions that he was just making small talk but ended up causing a big argument.\n\nFirst, considering the girlfriend's trauma, especially related to situations where she might feel pressured or manipulated, the song's lyrics could be triggering. The song has been criticized for being about coercion, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. The author acknowledges that if he had thought more carefully, he wouldn't have brought it up, which suggests he should have been more aware of her sensitivities.\n\nThe author tried to explain his perspective but didn't do thorough research beforehand. He relied on a cursory read and his gut, which led to an argument. Even though he later did more research and tried to explain his views again, the initial action of bringing up the topic without considering her feelings was problematic.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the author's failure to consider how the topic might affect her. The author's intention was small talk, but he didn't take into account her specific sensitivities. This lack of consideration and the resulting impact on their relationship suggest that the author made a mistake by not being more empathetic and prepared. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
