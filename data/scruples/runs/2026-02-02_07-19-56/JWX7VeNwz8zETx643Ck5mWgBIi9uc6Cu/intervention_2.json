She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The context is that the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her past, including a rape and abortion. The author brought up the song's controversy in small talk, expecting a light conversation but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's history of trauma is a significant factor. The song's controversy is related to it being seen as non-consensual, which aligns with #MeToo themes. The author mentions not doing thorough research and only having a cursory read of an opinion piece. That lack of preparation might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe author tried to explain their perspective but did so poorly, leading to a shouting match. The key points here are understanding the girlfriend's trauma and how bringing up a sensitive topic without being fully informed might have been insensitive. The author acknowledges that if they had thought more, they wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nIn relationships, especially when someone has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be empathetic and considerate. The author's intent was to discuss the controversy, but they didn't consider the emotional impact on their girlfriend. Even if the author had valid points about the song's removal, the way they approached it without sufficient research and without considering their partner's feelings was flawed. \n\nThe fact that the author ended up on the couch and there was a shouting match suggests that the conversation was hurtful. The author's decision to try again after doing more research is a positive step, but the initial action was problematic. The main issue is the lack of sensitivity towards the girlfriend's trauma and not doing enough to understand the context before bringing it up. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider their partner's emotional state and the potential impact of discussing a sensitive topic related to her past without thorough preparation and empathy.\n"
