She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend, which led to an argument. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he asked about the controversy during small talk. He wasn't aware of the depth of her trauma related to this topic. The girlfriend's reaction is in line with #MeToo, which suggests that the song's lyrics might be triggering for her because they could be seen as perpetuating non-consensual themes. \n\nThe key points here are: knowing the girlfriend's history with trauma, bringing up a potentially sensitive topic without realizing it's a trigger, and then trying to defend his viewpoint without fully understanding the issue. The author later tried to explain his reasoning but didn't have enough information initially. \n\nEven though he later researched more, the initial action was problematic. The girlfriend's trauma history means that certain topics can be deeply sensitive. The author should have been more aware of her triggers and perhaps avoided discussing such a controversial topic in the first place. Bringing it up without considering her perspective and history could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author's intention was to have small talk, but he didn't consider how it might affect her. The fact that she had a strong reaction indicates that it was a landmine. The author's approach of trying to explain his stance without backing down immediately also contributed to the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, communication and sensitivity are crucial. The author's failure to recognize the potential impact of the topic on his girlfriend's mental health suggests that he was in the wrong. Even if his intentions were good, the result was hurtful, so he should have approached the situation more thoughtfully.\n"
