She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the message is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together four years and are in a loving relationship. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past experiences, including rape and abortion. The man brought up the song's controversy during casual conversation, expecting small talk but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nThe song was pulled from radio due to #MeToo concerns because the lyrics can be seen as non-consensual. The man's reasoning was that he thought the removal was excessive and wanted to discuss the broader picture, but he didn't have much prior research. He tried to explain his view but did so poorly. The girlfriend was upset, and he ended up on the couch. Later, he tried again with more information, but it led to more conflict.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's trauma history, bringing up a topic that could trigger her is a significant factor. The man's intention was to discuss the controversy, but he didn't consider how it might affect her. Even if he had his own perspective, he didn't do sufficient research beforehand, which shows a lack of sensitivity. His attempt to explain his view after the fact was too late and may have worsened the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma and the man's failure to consider her feelings when choosing topics to discuss. While he might have had good intentions, the way he approached the topic without understanding its emotional weight on her is problematic. The man's actions led to a conflict that could have been avoided if he had been more mindful of her history.\n\nSo, even though he wasn't trying to be malicious, his lack of awareness and preparation made the situation hurtful. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize her emotional well-being in that moment.\n"
