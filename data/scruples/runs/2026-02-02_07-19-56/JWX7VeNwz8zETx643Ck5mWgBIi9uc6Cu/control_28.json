She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her past, including a rape and abortion. The author brought it up as small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma history is significant. Topics that might seem trivial to others could be deeply triggering for her. The author mentions she's aligned with #MeToo, which probably means she's sensitive to issues of consent and power dynamics. The song in question has been criticized for being non-consensual, which is a huge red flag in the #MeToo context.\n\nThe author's intention was small talk, but he didn't consider her trauma. Even if his intention was neutral, the impact was negative. He tried to defend his stance without enough research and ended up causing distress. The fact that he had to do more research later shows he didn't prepare adequately. He also continued to push his viewpoint instead of backing down, leading to a shouting match.\n\nIn relationships, especially with someone who has trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of triggers. The author should have been more empathetic and checked if bringing up such a sensitive topic was appropriate. He prioritized his own need to express his opinion over her emotional well-being. Even though he had good intentions, the result was hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being considerate of her history and for not backing down when the conversation turned negative.\n"
