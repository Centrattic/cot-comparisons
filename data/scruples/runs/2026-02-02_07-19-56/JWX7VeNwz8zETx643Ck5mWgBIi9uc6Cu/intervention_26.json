She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context mentions that the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and a past relationship where she was raped and had an abortion. The author brought up the controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's background. People with complex PTSD can have strong emotional reactions to topics that trigger their trauma. The song's controversy likely relates to its interpretation as a non-consensual interaction, which would be particularly sensitive given her history. The author didn't seem to anticipate how this topic would affect her, which might indicate a lack of awareness or sensitivity.\n\nThe author admits he didn't do much research beyond a cursory read of an opinion piece. This suggests he didn't fully understand the nuances or the potential impact on his girlfriend. When she expressed her view aligned with #MeToo, he tried to counter her without sufficient evidence, which could come off as dismissive or trivializing her experiences.\n\nAfter the argument, he tried to revisit the topic with more knowledge, but the initial approach was problematic. Even if he had good intentions, bringing up a sensitive topic without considering the emotional weight it carries for his partner shows a lack of empathy. The key here is that the girlfriend's trauma history makes this issue more than just a debate about a song; it's a personal and emotional trigger.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not checking his girlfriend's emotional state or history before introducing a topic that could be deeply triggering. He should have prioritized her well-being over his own curiosity or need to discuss the controversy. Even if he had valid points, the timing and lack of consideration for her trauma make him at fault. The answer would be A, as he is in the wrong for not being sensitive to her past and the potential impact of the topic on her mental health.\n"
