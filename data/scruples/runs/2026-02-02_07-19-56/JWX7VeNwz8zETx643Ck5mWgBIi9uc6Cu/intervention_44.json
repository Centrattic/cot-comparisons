She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The context given is that the girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, past relationships, including a rape and abortion. The author brought up the song's controversy during small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a conflict. The author's intention was to discuss the broader implications of removing the song, but without sufficient research, just a gut feeling and a quick read of an opinion piece. The girlfriend's stance is aligned with #MeToo, which the author acknowledges. The result was a shouting match, the author sleeping on the couch, and feeling like they ruined the weekend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's action was insensitive. The girlfriend's trauma includes experiences where she was vulnerable, so bringing up a song that has been criticized for potentially non-consensual lyrics could be triggering. The author didn't check the context of the conversation beforehand and didn't consider how the topic might affect her. Even if the author had their own perspective, the key issue here is the lack of awareness of the girlfriend's trauma and the topic's potential to cause distress. The author's approach was to push their own point of view without backing down, which might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The author didn't validate her reaction but instead tried to argue, which is not supportive in a relationship where one partner has significant trauma. \n\nThe author's justification is that they wanted to understand their own views and not trivialize her stance, but the method was flawed. Bringing up a sensitive topic without prior context or understanding of the girlfriend's history shows a lack of consideration. The author's actions led to conflict because they didn't prioritize their partner's emotional well-being. Even if the author had good intentions, the outcome was harmful. In a healthy relationship, partners need to be mindful of each other's triggers and past experiences. The author's failure to do so here makes them at least partially at fault. The fact that the girlfriend's history includes such severe trauma makes the author's choice to bring up the topic without caution even more problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being sensitive and for not backing down when it became clear the topic was upsetting.\n"
