She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context is that the girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past rape, and an abortion. The author brought up the song's controversy, expecting small talk, but it led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma history. Discussing a song that has been pulled due to its problematic lyrics could be triggering, especially if it relates to consent or coercion, which are relevant to her past experiences. The author mentions that her stance aligns with #MeToo, which emphasizes issues like consent and power dynamics in relationships. The song's lyrics have been criticized for being coercive, so bringing it up might have inadvertently triggered her trauma.\n\nThe author's intention was to engage in small talk and share his perspective on the controversy. However, he admits he didn't do thorough research and relied on a cursory read. This shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and trauma. Even though he later tried to back up his views with more research, the initial approach was hasty and possibly insensitive.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships, especially when one partner has trauma. The author didn't consider how the topic might affect her before bringing it up. He tried to explain his viewpoint but did so poorly, leading to a shouting match. This suggests that he didn't prioritize her emotional well-being in the moment, which is a significant factor.\n\nWhile he did attempt to reconcile by doing more research, the initial action of bringing up the topic without understanding its potential impact on her was a mistake. The fact that she had a strong emotional reaction and he ended up on the couch indicates that the conversation was harmful to their relationship dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's failure to consider his girlfriend's trauma and the sensitive nature of the topic before initiating the conversation makes him at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
