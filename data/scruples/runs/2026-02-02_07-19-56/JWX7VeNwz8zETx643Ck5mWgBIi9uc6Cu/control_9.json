She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD, has been through a traumatic abortion, and is aligned with #MeToo. The guy brought up the song's controversy as small talk but ended up causing a big argument. He admitted he didn't do much research and just had a gut reaction and a quick opinion piece read. Now he's trying to justify his point but realizes he might have been insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key elements of the situation. The girlfriend's trauma is significant\u2014rape and abortion. The song in question has been criticized for being about coercion in a relationship, which aligns with #MeToo themes. The author brought it up without considering her sensitive background. Even though he tried to explain his stance, he didn't have solid evidence or context, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe main question is whether he was in the wrong. The girlfriend's trauma makes this a sensitive topic. Discussing something that could trigger her PTSD without being considerate of her history is problematic. The author's intent was small talk, but he didn't check if it was appropriate given her background. He also admitted his approach was poor and based on a cursory read. Even if he had valid points, the way he approached it without research and in a context where he knew her sensitivities makes him at fault.\n\nAdditionally, after the argument, he tried to re-engage the discussion immediately, which might not have been the best approach. He should have focused on apologizing and understanding her feelings first rather than pushing his own views. His actions led to a ruined weekend and a major argument, which indicates that he didn't prioritize her well-being and emotional state. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
