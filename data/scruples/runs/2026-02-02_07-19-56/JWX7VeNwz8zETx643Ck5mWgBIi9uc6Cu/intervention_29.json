She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context is that the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The author brought up the song's controversy as small talk, not knowing it would trigger her. He tried to explain his viewpoint but ended up causing a conflict that led to them not sleeping together and a shouting match the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma. Complex PTSD can make certain topics very sensitive. The song in question has been criticized for potentially being about non-consensual relationships, which directly relates to the girlfriend's history of being raped. So bringing up a song that has such controversy could be triggering, especially without prior discussion about such topics.\n\nThe author admits he didn't do proper research and only had a cursory read. That suggests he didn't take the time to understand the depth of the issue, which could show a lack of consideration for her feelings. He also says he didn't want to trivialize her views but still tried to push his own perspective. That might come off as dismissive of her trauma.\n\nHowever, the author did try to explain his position and later tried to revisit the conversation with more knowledge. But the key issue here is the initial decision to bring up a topic that's likely to be problematic for his girlfriend. Even if his intent was small talk, he should have been aware of her history and the potential for that topic to trigger her. In a relationship, especially with someone with PTSD, being mindful of each other's triggers is crucial. The fact that he didn't know about the controversy's direct link to her trauma (the rape) might be a factor, but the trauma is already part of the context he should consider.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is in line with #MeToo, which is about addressing issues of consent and power dynamics. The song's controversy is part of that movement. The author's stance might be seen as conflicting with her values, which could lead to tension. The fact that he felt the need to defend the removal of the song as excessive could be perceived as not supporting her views, especially when they are rooted in her personal trauma.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely acted inconsiderately by not anticipating how bringing up that topic would affect his girlfriend. Even if he didn't have malicious intent, he should have been more aware of her sensitivities. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
