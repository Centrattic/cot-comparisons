She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together four years and is in a loving relationship. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The author initiated a conversation about the song's controversy, expecting light small talk, but it led to a significant conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the author's intent. The author mentions that he was making small talk and didn't anticipate the strong reaction. He also tried to explain his perspective but admitted he didn't do thorough research beforehand. He later tried to apologize and provide more context after realizing the depth of the issue.\n\nConsidering the girlfriend's history, discussing a song that's been linked to problematic gender dynamics could easily trigger her trauma, especially with the #MeToo movement's relevance. The author knew about her PTSD but still brought up a topic that could be emotionally charged. While his intention wasn't malicious, the impact was significant. He didn't take her trauma into account sufficiently before the conversation, even if he tried to backtrack afterward.\n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might be sensitive. The author's failure to preemptively consider how this might affect her suggests he was in the wrong. Even though he tried to explain his stance, the initial action of bringing up the topic without sensitivity was problematic. The outcome\u2014her emotional response, the shouting match, and sleeping on the couch\u2014indicates that his approach was hurtful.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her trauma and triggered a negative reaction, despite his intentions. It's about how the action affected her, not just his intent.\n"
