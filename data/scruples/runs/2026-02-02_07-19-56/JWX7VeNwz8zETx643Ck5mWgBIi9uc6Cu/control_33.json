She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who brought up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy is in the wrong. The context is that the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and abortion. The author, after making small talk about the song's controversy, ended up in an argument and slept on the couch.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are the girlfriend's trauma and the author's intent. The author mentions they were just making small talk and didn't expect a strong reaction. However, the girlfriend's response was intense, aligning with #MeToo, which the author acknowledges they might have overlooked.\n\nThe song controversy is about the lyrics being interpreted as non-consensual, which ties into the #MeToo movement. The author admits they didn't do thorough research, just a cursory read. That lack of preparation might have contributed to triggering the girlfriend. The girlfriend's past trauma makes her more sensitive to such topics, so bringing it up without considering her feelings could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author tried to explain their perspective but did so poorly. They also mention not wanting to trivialize her views, which is good, but the approach was flawed. The fact that they brought up the topic without knowing her history and the potential impact shows a lack of consideration. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given her background, so the author's mistake was not recognizing the sensitivity of the subject in their relationship.\n\nThe argument that the author was just making small talk might not excuse the outcome. Partners need to be aware of each other's triggers, especially when one has a history of trauma. The author should have been more cautious about discussing a controversial topic that could relate to their partner's past. Even if the intention was neutral, the effect was harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the potential impact and proceeding without adequate understanding.\n"
