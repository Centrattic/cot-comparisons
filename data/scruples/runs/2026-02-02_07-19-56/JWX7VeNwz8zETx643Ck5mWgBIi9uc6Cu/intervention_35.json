She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy to his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past rape, and an abortion. The author mentions that he was making small talk and didn't realize it would trigger such a strong reaction. He tried to defend his view but didn't have much evidence, just a gut feeling and an opinion piece. Now, he's upset about the conflict and wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma history. People with complex PTSD can be more sensitive to certain topics. The song's controversy is related to consent, which is a big part of the #MeToo movement. The author's girlfriend aligning with #MeToo makes sense given her experiences. Bringing up the controversy might have triggered her, especially since the song's lyrics can be seen as non-consensual.\n\nThe author's intention was casual conversation, but he didn't consider her trauma. He tried to argue his point without doing thorough research, which could come off as dismissive. Even if he had valid points, the way he approached it without understanding the emotional impact on his partner is problematic. He didn't check in with her feelings first, which is a key part of communication in a relationship. \n\nAlso, after the conflict, he tried to explain his side again but maybe too late. The initial reaction was a shouting match, indicating that the topic was a major trigger. The author should have been more considerate of her history and avoided the topic unless she brought it up. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take into account his girlfriend's trauma and brought up a sensitive topic without considering how it might affect her. He also didn't approach the conversation with the necessary care and understanding.\n"
