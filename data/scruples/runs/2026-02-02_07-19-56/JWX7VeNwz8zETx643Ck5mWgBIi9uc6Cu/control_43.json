She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD related to her past, including being raped and having an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's girlfriend has significant trauma, so discussing a song that has been criticized for its problematic lyrics could be triggering. The author mentions he brought it up as small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it escalated. His girlfriend's reaction is in line with #MeToo, which makes sense given her history. \n\nThe author tried to explain his perspective but did so with limited knowledge, just a cursory read of an opinion piece. That lack of depth might have made his argument seem dismissive of her feelings. He also didn't back down immediately and instead tried to push further after she was upset, which could be seen as not respecting her emotional state. \n\nHe ended up sleeping on the couch and caused a shouting match the next morning. Even though he later did more research, his initial approach was careless. The key issue here is whether he should have known better given her history. Since he's aware of her trauma, bringing up a potentially triggering topic without sensitivity is problematic. \n\nThe author's intention was to share his view, but he didn't consider the emotional impact on his girlfriend. He didn't prioritize her feelings and instead tried to debate, which exacerbated the situation. So, even if he didn't mean to, his actions were insensitive. The fact that he later tried to reconcile doesn't negate the initial mistake. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong for not being considerate of her trauma and pushing his viewpoint without proper understanding.\n"
