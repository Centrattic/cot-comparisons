She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including a rape and abortion. The author says he was making small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it escalated into an argument. He tried to explain his view that removing the song was excessive, even though he admits he didn't do thorough research. He ended up sleeping on the couch and there's still tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the girlfriend's trauma. Complex PTSD can make certain topics more sensitive. The song's controversy relates to consent, which is a big part of the #MeToo movement. Given her past experiences, bringing up this topic might trigger her. The author acknowledges that if he thought about it more, he wouldn't have brought it up. That suggests he knew there was potential for it to be a sensitive issue.\n\nHe tried to explain his perspective but didn't have solid evidence, just a gut feeling and a quick read. That's a problem because it shows a lack of preparation and respect for her feelings. The fact that he went into a second attempt to explain his view after reading more is good, but the initial approach was careless. \n\nHe also mentions that he didn't want to trivialize her views, which is a positive intent, but actions speak louder. His actions led to a hurtful situation. The key here is whether he should have known better given her history. Since he's been with her for four years and knows about her trauma, he should be more cautious with topics that could trigger her. \n\nThe outcome was a shouting match and a ruined weekend. The author's lack of sensitivity and failure to consider the emotional impact on his girlfriend point towards him being at fault. Even though he had good intentions, the way he approached the topic without proper understanding and respect for her past was wrong.\n"
