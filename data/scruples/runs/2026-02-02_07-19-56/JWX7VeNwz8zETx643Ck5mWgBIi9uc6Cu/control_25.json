She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing and a past trauma involving rape and abortion. The song in question has been controversial because of its lyrics where a man seems to be coercing a woman to stay with him. The song was removed from some radio stations in line with #MeToo movements, which challenge sexual harassment and violence.\n\nThe author mentions that he brought up the controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation. However, his girlfriend had a strong reaction, which led to a conflict. The author tried to explain his perspective, thinking the removal was excessive, but now feels guilty and wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's trauma history, bringing up a topic that can be triggering (like a song that's seen as promoting coercion) might not be the best idea. Even if the author's intention was just to start a conversation, he didn't consider her past experiences. The key here is that he didn't check in with her about how she might feel before discussing it. He also didn't back down when she expressed her strong feelings, instead trying to push his viewpoint further. That could be seen as insensitive, especially given her trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the author says he later tried to offer a more informed perspective. But the initial mistake was not considering her trauma. In relationships where one partner has significant trauma, it's important to be mindful of topics that might trigger them. The fact that he ended up causing an argument and she was upset shows that he might have been in the wrong for not being considerate enough.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he brought up a sensitive topic without considering his girlfriend's history and continued the discussion despite her strong reaction.\n"
