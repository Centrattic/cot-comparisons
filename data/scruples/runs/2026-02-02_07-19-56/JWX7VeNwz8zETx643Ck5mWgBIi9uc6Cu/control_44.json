She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The key points to consider are the context of their relationship, the girlfriend's trauma history, and the author's intent and actions.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past relationships, including a rape and an abortion. That's a significant piece of information because it means certain topics might be more triggering for her. The author mentions that they were making small talk and expected a casual conversation but ended up causing distress. \n\nThe song in question has been criticized for being problematic, with some viewing it as a predatory seduction scenario. The author's stance is that the removal of the song is excessive, but they didn't do thorough research before bringing it up. They admit to having a cursory read of an opinion piece and relying on their gut. \n\nThe author's intention was to discuss the controversy and explain their viewpoint, but they didn't consider the emotional impact on their partner. Even though they had good intentions, the lack of awareness about the song's problematic nature and the girlfriend's trauma history is a key point. The girlfriend's reaction was in line with #MeToo sentiments, which the author acknowledges they might not have considered enough.\n\nThe author also tried again the next day to explain their view, but the initial conversation likely caused more harm. They ended up on the couch and a shouting match ensued. The fact that the author didn't back down immediately and instead tried to push their perspective might have escalated the conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's mistake was not being sensitive to their partner's trauma and bringing up a topic that's triggering without understanding the depth of its impact. Even if the intention was small talk, the context of the girlfriend's history makes the author's action problematic. The correct answer here is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't prioritize their partner's emotional well-being and failed to recognize the sensitivity of the subject matter in the context of her trauma.\n"
