She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past relationship where she was raped and had an abortion. The author mentions that the song was controversial because of its lyrics that some find problematic, especially from a #MeToo perspective. The author brought it up as small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it escalated because of the girlfriend's trauma.\n\nThe author tried to explain why they thought the removal was excessive, but they didn't do thorough research beforehand. They relied on a cursory read of an opinion piece. The girlfriend was upset, leading to a shouting match and the author sleeping on the couch. The author later tried to discuss it again with more knowledge, but the initial approach was problematic.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's history, bringing up a song that has lyrics perceived as non-consensual or coercive could be a trigger. The author didn't consider the emotional impact before discussing it. Even if the author's intention was just small talk, they didn't take into account the girlfriend's past trauma. The fact that the girlfriend's reaction was strong indicates that the topic is sensitive for her.\n\nThe author also admits that if they thought for a minute, they wouldn't have brought it up. That suggests some level of awareness that this could be a sensitive topic. However, they proceeded anyway, which shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Additionally, the author tried to argue their point without sufficient evidence, which might have made the girlfriend feel her trauma was being dismissed.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has trauma, it's important to be mindful of topics that could trigger them. The author's actions here, while perhaps not malicious, were insensitive and disregarded the girlfriend's emotional well-being. Even though the author later tried to explain their viewpoint with more knowledge, the initial approach was flawed.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take the necessary precautions to consider their girlfriend's feelings and history before bringing up a potentially triggering topic. They should have been more empathetic and avoided the conversation until they understood its impact on her.\n"
