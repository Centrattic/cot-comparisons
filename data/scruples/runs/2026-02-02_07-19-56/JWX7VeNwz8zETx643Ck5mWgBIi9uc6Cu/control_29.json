She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The girlfriend has complex PTSD due to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The author mentions that her stance is aligned with #MeToo. The song in question has been criticized for being non-consensual, which is a big deal given his girlfriend's history.\n\nThe author initiated a conversation about a sensitive topic without considering her feelings or past trauma. He acknowledges that he didn't do much research beyond an opinion piece. Even though he had good intentions and wanted to discuss different perspectives, he didn't account for her emotional state. \n\nHe tried to explain his viewpoint but did it poorly, which led to a conflict. The key here is that he brought up a topic that's likely triggering for her. Even if he had his reasons, not being mindful of her trauma and pushing his opinion without understanding the depth of her feelings seems like a mistake.\n\nHe also mentions sleeping on the couch and a subsequent shouting match, which indicates that the conversation caused significant distress. The fact that he had to apologize later and looked up more information shows he realized his error. So, his initial action of bringing up the topic without considering her feelings was inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, especially with someone who has trauma, it's crucial to be aware of sensitive topics. The author's failure to take that into account makes him at least partially responsible. Even if the topic itself is debatable, the way and timing of bringing it up were problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
