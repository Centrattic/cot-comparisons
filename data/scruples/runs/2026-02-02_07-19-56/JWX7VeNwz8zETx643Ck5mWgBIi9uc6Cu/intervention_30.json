She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history with complex PTSD, including past rape and abortion, and how the author's comment triggered a strong negative reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he brought up the controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but got an intense response. His girlfriend aligns with #MeToo, so the song's context might be triggering for her. The song's lyrics have been criticized for being non-consensual, which could be a sensitive topic for someone with her history. \n\nThe author admits he didn't do much research before bringing it up and only had a cursory read of an opinion piece. This lack of preparation could show insensitivity. He also tried to defend his stance without considering her feelings, leading to a shouting match. He later tried to explain his viewpoint with more knowledge, but the initial approach was flawed. \n\nIn relationships, especially with a partner who has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might cause distress. The author didn't consider her emotional state and proceeded without understanding the potential impact. Even if his intentions were to discuss the controversy, the timing and manner were inappropriate. His actions led to conflict and hurt feelings, which suggests he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not being sensitive to his girlfriend's trauma and bringing up a triggering topic without proper consideration and emotional support.\n"
