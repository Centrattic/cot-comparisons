She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context is that the author brought up the controversy around the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her past, including a rape and abortion. The author was trying to have small talk but ended up causing a conflict. He expressed his view that the removal of the song was excessive, based on a quick read of an opinion piece. The girlfriend's response was in line with #MeToo, and the situation escalated, leading to them sleeping separately and a shouting match the next morning.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the sensitivity around the topic. The author didn't do enough research or consider her feelings beforehand. Even though he tried to explain his stance, his initial approach was careless. The song's controversy is about the lyrics being interpreted as non-consensual, which directly relates to the girlfriend's trauma. Bringing it up without knowing her history could be seen as insensitive, especially since she's been through similar experiences. \n\nThe author acknowledges he didn't back down but tried to re-enter the conversation with more info. However, the initial action of bringing up such a sensitive topic without understanding its impact on her was a mistake. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that he knew her trauma and still chose to discuss something that could trigger her, even if it was small talk, shows a lack of consideration. The answer leans towards Yes (A). But maybe there's a nuance. Did he have prior knowledge that this song would be a trigger? The user says she struggles with PTSD related to upbringing and past relationships, including rape and abortion. The song's lyrics about a man pressuring a woman could very easily trigger her. So, not checking in first or being aware of that connection would be wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
