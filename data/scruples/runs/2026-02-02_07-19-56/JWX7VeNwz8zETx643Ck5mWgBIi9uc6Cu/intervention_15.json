She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and abortion. The author mentions that he brought it up as small talk but didn't consider how it might affect her. He tried to explain his view but didn't back it up with thorough research, just a quick read of an opinion piece. The girlfriend is aligned with #MeToo, so the song's controversy about consent and power dynamics likely triggered her. The author didn't check the history of the song before discussing it, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the key point is whether the author should have considered his girlfriend's history before bringing up a topic that could be triggering. Since he knew about her trauma and the #MeToo movement's relevance to her experiences, he had a responsibility to be cautious. Bringing up a song that has been criticized for its portrayal of a non-consensual scenario could easily upset her. The fact that he didn't do proper research beyond a cursory read suggests he wasn't fully informed about the depth of the issue, which might have made it harder to have a respectful conversation. His approach was to express his opinion without fully understanding the context and without considering the emotional impact on his partner. Even if his intention was just small talk, the content of the topic was sensitive given her history. The author's failure to recognize the potential harm of his actions, especially knowing her background, places the responsibility on him to have been more considerate and informed. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
