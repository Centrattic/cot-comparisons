She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together four years, and they love each other. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past rape, and an abortion. The author brought up the song controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation. However, his girlfriend reacted strongly, aligning with #MeToo. The author tried to explain his view that the song's removal was excessive but didn't do enough research beforehand. He later tried to apologize with more knowledge, but it led to more conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't consider his girlfriend's trauma history when bringing up the topic. The song's controversy centers around it being seen as a non-consensual scenario, which directly relates to the girlfriend's experiences. Even though the author had good intentions and later tried to make amends, the initial action was careless. He didn't check if this topic was sensitive for her, which it clearly is. In relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of triggers. The author's failure to recognize and respect her boundaries led to a hurtful situation. So, even if he didn't mean to, his actions were insensitive. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
