She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing, a past rape, and an abortion. The guy mentioned the song's controversy, which she took as a #MeToo issue, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has a history of trauma, especially with issues related to consent and reproductive rights. The song in question has been criticized for its potentially coercive lyrics, which aligns with #MeToo themes. The author brought up the controversy as small talk, but didn't realize how sensitive the topic was for her. He tried to defend his view that removing the song was excessive, but without doing thorough research beyond a quick opinion piece.\n\nThe question is whether he was wrong. The key points here are: 1) He didn't consider her trauma when choosing the topic of conversation. 2) He didn't do proper research before discussing it. 3) He insisted on his viewpoint despite her strong emotional reaction. 4) He later tried to explain his stance but didn't initially back down, which might have escalated the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, it's important to be mindful of sensitive topics. Even if the topic isn't inherently offensive, the way it's approached and the partner's personal history matter. The author might not have intended harm, but he didn't account for her feelings. His attempt to explain his view after the fact was better, but the initial reaction shows a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A) Yes, the author is in the wrong because he brought up a sensitive topic without considering her trauma and didn't handle the discussion with the necessary care and research.\n"
