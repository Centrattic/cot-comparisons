She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD, which is related to her upbringing and past relationships, including being raped and having an abortion. The author says he was just making small talk and didn't realize it would be such a sensitive topic. He tried to explain his perspective but ended up causing a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author knew his girlfriend's history with trauma, which is significant. Bringing up a topic that could trigger her PTSD without considering its impact on her seems problematic. Even if he was just making small talk, he should have been more mindful of her past experiences. The fact that he continued to argue his point after she expressed her strong views (aligned with #MeToo) adds to the issue. He didn't back down and instead tried to push his perspective further, which might have invalidated her feelings.\n\nThe song's controversy is about consent, which is directly related to her trauma. The author's initial lack of research and his approach to discussing it without empathy likely made her feel dismissed. Even though he later tried to read more and explain his stance, the immediate reaction and the way he handled the conversation were probably hurtful. The result was a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch, indicating the conversation was not productive.\n\nIn relationships, especially when someone has a history of trauma, communication needs to be handled with care. The author should have considered her feelings first and maybe avoided the topic unless he was sure it was safe. His actions show a lack of awareness and sensitivity, which is where he went wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize her emotional well-being and pushed his views instead of backing down when she was upset.\n"
