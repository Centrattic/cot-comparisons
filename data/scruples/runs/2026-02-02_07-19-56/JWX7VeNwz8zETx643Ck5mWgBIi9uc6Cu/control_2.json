She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing up the \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has a history of complex PTSD and past trauma, including rape and abortion. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the context.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that his girlfriend's trauma is related to her upbringing and past relationships, specifically a rape and abortion. The song in question has been controversial because it's seen as having a non-consensual undertone, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. The author brought it up as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend's trauma history, the sensitivity of the topic, and the author's approach. The author admits he didn't do thorough research and only had a cursory read of an opinion piece. He tried to argue that removing the song was excessive, which could be seen as dismissing the concerns of the #MeToo movement. Given his girlfriend's background, discussing such a topic without considering her feelings could be very triggering.\n\nThe author's intent was to share his perspective, but he failed to consider how the topic might affect her. Even if he had his own reasoning, the way he approached it\u2014without adequate understanding and in a casual manner\u2014was insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given her trauma. The author acknowledges that he probably should have thought more before bringing it up, which suggests he recognizes his mistake. The fact that he ended up on the couch and had to apologize later also indicates that his actions were harmful, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he brought up a sensitive topic without considering his girlfriend's trauma and history, leading to a conflict. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
