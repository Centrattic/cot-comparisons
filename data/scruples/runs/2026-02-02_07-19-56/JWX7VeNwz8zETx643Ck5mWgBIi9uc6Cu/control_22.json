She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context is that his girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD, including being raped and having an abortion. The author mentions that he brought up the topic expecting casual conversation but ended up causing a conflict. He tried to explain his view that removing the song was excessive, but he didn't do much research beforehand. They ended up having a shouting match, and he slept on the couch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Given her trauma history, certain topics might trigger her. The song's controversy is related to consent, which is a sensitive issue for someone with her background. Even if the author's intention was just small talk, the topic itself could be triggering. The fact that he didn't do much research beforehand suggests he might not have been fully aware of how sensitive this issue is for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to explain his viewpoint and later did more research. He also tried to apologize and understand better. But the key point here is that he brought up a topic that could be deeply personal and triggering without considering her past. Even if he had good intentions, the action of bringing it up without prior knowledge of her sensitivities could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he acknowledged her trauma, but still proceeded to discuss a controversial topic that relates to consent and possibly her personal experiences, it seems like he overlooked her feelings. The fact that she reacted strongly indicates that the topic was a significant issue for her. The author's mistake was not checking in with her about how she feels about such topics beforehand. \n\nEven though he tried to explain his side and did more research later, the initial act of bringing it up without understanding the context of her trauma might be where he went wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given her history, so the author's approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
