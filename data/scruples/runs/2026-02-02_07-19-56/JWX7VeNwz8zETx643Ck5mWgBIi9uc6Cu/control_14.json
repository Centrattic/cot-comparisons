She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD related to past trauma, including rape and abortion.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD, which makes her more vulnerable to certain topics. The song in question has been controversial because of its lyrics being interpreted as non-consensual, aligning with #MeToo movement critiques. The author brought up the controversy as small talk without knowing her personal history. That seems like a misstep because he didn't consider her trauma background.\n\nHe tried to explain his perspective but didn't do thorough research beforehand. Even though he later looked into the song's history, the initial action was careless. The girlfriend's reaction was intense because the topic likely triggered her past experiences. The author's approach was to defend his view without fully understanding the emotional weight for her. \n\nIn relationships, especially when a partner has trauma, it's crucial to be sensitive to their triggers. The author didn't check in with her feelings first, which led to conflict. Even if his intentions were to discuss the controversy, he didn't account for her personal history. The result was her feeling invalidated and him sleeping on the couch, followed by more conflict the next day.\n\nSo, considering her trauma and the sensitive nature of the topic, the author's action was insensitive. He should have been more cautious and aware of her history before bringing up such a charged subject. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
