She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The context mentions that the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including being raped and having an abortion. The author brought up the song controversy during small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma. The song has been criticized for being about a man pressuring a woman into sexual activity, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. Since the girlfriend has a history of trauma, especially related to rape, the song could be triggering. The author's initial approach was just a casual mention without considering her potential sensitivity. Even if the author had their own perspective on the controversy, they didn't take into account her feelings or history before bringing it up.\n\nThe author then tried to explain their viewpoint using a cursory read and gut feeling, which didn't show much research or empathy. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, leading to a shouting match and the author sleeping on the couch. Afterward, the author tried to revisit the conversation with more knowledge, but it seems like they didn't fully address their initial mistake of not considering her trauma.\n\nIn relationships, especially with someone who has PTSD, it's crucial to be aware of triggers and sensitive topics. The author's action of bringing up a potentially triggering subject without prior consideration of the girlfriend's history shows a lack of empathy and awareness. Even if the intention was just small talk, the content of the topic was inappropriate given her background. The fact that they didn't back down immediately and tried to justify their stance further could have exacerbated the situation.\n\nSo, the author did make a mistake by not considering the girlfriend's trauma and bringing up a sensitive topic without understanding the potential impact. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
