She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD and a history of trauma. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past relationships, including a rape and an abortion. That's a significant factor here. Trauma can make certain topics extremely sensitive, and the user is bringing up a song that's been controversial for its perceived coercion in lyrics, which directly ties into the girlfriend's history.\n\nThe author's intention was small talk, but he didn't consider how the topic might affect her. Even if he had a genuine interest in discussing the song's history, he didn't check in with her or be mindful of her past. The fact that he \"didn't do any evidence besides gut and a cursory read\" shows he didn't put in the effort to understand the sensitivity or the deeper implications for her.\n\nHe also tried to defend his point of view, which might have made her feel invalidated. In a relationship, especially with a partner who has trauma, communication needs to be empathetic and considerate. Bringing up such a topic without being aware of her triggers is a mistake. Even if he later tried to explain his stance, the initial approach was flawed.\n\nThe outcome was a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch. This suggests that the conversation wasn't handled well. The key here is that he should have been more attuned to her emotional state and avoided the topic. The fact that the song relates to consent and coercion, which are directly linked to her trauma, makes it a trigger. \n\nSo, the author's error was not recognizing the sensitivity of the subject given her background. He prioritized his own curiosity over her emotional well-being. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
