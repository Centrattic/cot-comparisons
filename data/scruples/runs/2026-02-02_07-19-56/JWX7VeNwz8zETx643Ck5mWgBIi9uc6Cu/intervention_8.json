She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" song controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD, including a past rape and abortion. The author thought he was making small talk but ended up causing a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the girlfriend's trauma. Since she has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past relationships, especially the rape and abortion, any content that could be triggering should be approached carefully. The song in question was controversial for being suggestive and potentially non-consensual, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. \n\nThe author mentions he brought it up expecting small talk but didn't consider her perspective. He admits he didn't do any research beyond a cursory read, which might have led to him missing the deeper issues related to consent and power dynamics in the song. His attempt to explain his view came off as not respecting her stance, which is tied to her traumatic experiences.\n\nHe also tried to defend the song's removal as excessive, which could be seen as dismissing the valid concerns about consent. Even if he had a different opinion, the way he approached the conversation without understanding her trauma history could be harmful. The result was a heated argument and sleep on the couch, indicating the conversation was hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are understanding the girlfriend's trauma, the sensitive nature of the topic, and the author's lack of preparation and empathy. Bringing up a potentially triggering subject without thorough understanding and consideration of her feelings is where he went wrong. Even though he later tried to explain with more knowledge, the initial act of bringing it up without awareness of its impact on her is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her trauma and the sensitive context before discussing the song, leading to harm in their relationship.\n"
