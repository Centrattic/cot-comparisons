She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The author brought up the song's controversy during small talk, which led to a conflict. The girlfriend's stance is aligned with #MeToo, which the author acknowledges. He tried to explain his perspective but didn't have a lot of evidence, just a gut feeling and an opinion piece.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma history is significant. \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" has been controversial because of its lyrics being seen as problematic in light of consent, which ties into #MeToo themes. By bringing it up, the author might have inadvertently triggered her. Even if he had good intentions, he didn't consider her history and the emotional impact the topic might have on her. \n\nThe author admits he didn't do much research beyond a cursory read. This suggests he wasn't fully informed about the nuances of the controversy, especially given his girlfriend's background. He should have been more mindful of her trauma and the potential for the topic to be triggering. Even if he wanted to discuss it as part of his interest in song history, he didn't take into account her emotional state. \n\nAlso, when she reacted negatively, he tried to push his point of view without backing down, which escalated the situation. Instead of apologizing and addressing her feelings first, he doubled down, leading to another argument. This shows a lack of empathy and prioritization of his own perspective over her emotional well-being. \n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history, the sensitivity of the topic given that history, and the author's failure to approach the conversation with the necessary care and consideration. Even if the intention was to engage in small talk, the subject matter was potentially harmful, and he didn't have the right approach. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
