She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up a song controversy that upset his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from past trauma, including rape and abortion. The song in question is \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" which has been controversial due to its lyrics being seen as non-consensual. The author mentions that he brought up the controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma is significant, and topics related to non-consensual acts could be triggering. The author knew about her PTSD and her alignment with #MeToo, yet he brought up the song without considering how it might affect her. Even if he had his own reasons for thinking the removal was excessive, the key point here is whether he considered her feelings and history before initiating the conversation.\n\nHe admitted that if he had thought for a minute, he probably wouldn't have brought it up. That suggests he realized the potential sensitivity but proceeded anyway. His attempt to explain his viewpoint was \"poorly\" done, and he didn't do thorough research beyond a cursory opinion piece. This lack of preparation and sensitivity could have made her feel that her trauma wasn't being respected.\n\nAlso, after the initial conflict, he tried to re-engage by reading more, but the initial act of bringing up the topic without checking if she was comfortable was a misstep. People with PTSD often need to avoid certain triggers, and discussing controversial content related to their trauma can be deeply hurtful. The author's approach was to present his viewpoint without ensuring mutual understanding or safety in the conversation.\n\nEven if the topic itself isn't inherently wrong, the way he approached it, given her history, shows a lack of consideration. The fact that they ended up in a shouting match and he had to apologize indicates that his actions caused harm. The author's intention was to have a discussion, but the outcome was negative because he didn't prioritize her emotional well-being.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has significant trauma, the onus is on the other partner to be mindful and avoid bringing up topics that could be triggering without prior discussion. The author's mistake was not respecting her boundaries and history in this case. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
