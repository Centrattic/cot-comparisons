She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing up a controversial song, \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" with their girlfriend who has a history of trauma, including rape and an abortion. The girlfriend has strong #MeToo views, and the author's comment about the controversy led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD and a traumatic history. The song in question has been criticized for its lyrics being seen as non-consensual, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. The author brought up the controversy during casual conversation, not expecting such a strong reaction. However, their motivation was to discuss the broader implications and historical context, but they didn't do thorough research beforehand.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the author's approach. The author mentions they \"didn't do any of that [research] before stepping on that landmine,\" which suggests they weren't fully informed about the song's problematic aspects. Even though they had good intentions to explain their perspective, they didn't consider the emotional impact on their partner. The girlfriend's reaction was significant enough that they ended up on the couch and had a shouting match the next morning.\n\nThe author tried to defend their stance by citing a cursory read of an opinion piece, which isn't sufficient, especially when discussing a topic that could trigger someone with a history of trauma. The fact that the author didn't back down immediately and instead tried to re-enter the conversation with more information might have come off as dismissive of their partner's feelings. The girlfriend felt her views were being challenged, which is a sensitive area given her past experiences.\n\nIn relationships, especially with a partner who has trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that could trigger them. The author's lack of thorough research and the context of the girlfriend's trauma suggest that bringing up the song's controversy without being fully aware of its implications was a misstep. The author's actions led to emotional distress for their partner, which is a valid reason for the girlfriend's reaction. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not considering the potential impact of their words and not backing down immediately to prioritize their partner's well-being.\n"
