She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing up the controversy around the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD related to past trauma, including rape and an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend has complex PTSD, which is a serious mental health condition. Her past experiences are significant here, especially given the #MeToo movement's alignment with her stance. The song in question has been controversial because some interpret it as a man pressuring a woman into a sexual situation. \n\nThe author says he brought it up as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but ended up causing a major conflict. His reasoning for bringing it up was due to his interest in the history of songs and their meanings. However, he didn't do thorough research beforehand and only had a cursory read of an opinion piece. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's trauma, even if the song is a work of art, it's possible that the content triggered her. The #MeToo movement emphasizes consent and the power dynamics in such scenarios, which the song's lyrics might reflect. The author's initial approach was to defend the song's removal as excessive, which could come across as dismissing her feelings or the broader cultural conversation around consent. \n\nHe tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't back it up with solid evidence, relying instead on his gut and a quick read. This lack of preparation might have made the conversation seem insincere or dismissive of her trauma. Even though he later researched more and tried to revisit the discussion, the initial approach likely hurt her. \n\nImportant factors here are the girlfriend's history and the sensitivity of the topic. The author should have been more mindful of her trauma before discussing something that could be triggering. Even if he had a valid point, the way he approached it\u2014without considering her feelings first\u2014was a misstep. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key here is whether he should have known better. Given her history, bringing up a controversial song that relates to consent and pressure might not have been the right choice without considering her perspective first. He prioritized his own curiosity and viewpoint over her emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he should have been more considerate and researched more thoroughly before bringing up the topic, especially knowing her trauma.\n"
