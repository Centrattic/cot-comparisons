She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author brought up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend, who has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The author mentions that they were expecting small talk but it escalated into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the girlfriend's trauma. People with PTSD, especially from situations like rape, can be very sensitive to certain topics. The song in question has been criticized for being non-consensual, which could trigger her. The author knew about her history but still brought up the topic. Even if they intended small talk, knowing her background makes it a risky move.\n\nThe author also admits they didn't do much research beyond a cursory read of an opinion piece. That might have led them to be uninformed about the deeper issues the song presents, especially from a victim's perspective. They tried to argue against the removal of the song, which could be seen as dismissing the victims' experiences. Even if they had a different opinion, the way they approached it without proper understanding or sensitivity could have been hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was strong, leading to a shouting match and the author sleeping on the couch. The author then tried to explain their stance again with more knowledge, but it seems like they didn't back down immediately, which might have made things worse. The key here is whether the author should have known better, given the girlfriend's history. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to be aware of each other's triggers. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but bringing up a sensitive topic without considering the emotional impact could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the topic is neutral to some, it's not neutral for someone with related trauma. The fact that the author didn't apologize immediately and tried to push their point further might show a lack of empathy, which would place them in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author had knowledge of the girlfriend's trauma, brought up a potentially triggering topic without understanding the depth of the issue, and didn't back down when it became clear it was causing distress. Therefore, they are likely in the wrong.\n"
