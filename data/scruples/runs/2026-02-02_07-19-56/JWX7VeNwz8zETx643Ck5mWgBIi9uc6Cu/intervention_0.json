She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD and a history of trauma. The author's girlfriend had a past where she was raped and had an abortion, which probably makes the topic especially sensitive for her.\n\nThe author mentions that he brought up the controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it escalated. He tried to explain why he thought the removal of the song was excessive, but he didn't do much research beforehand\u2014just a quick read of an opinion piece. His girlfriend's reaction was strong, leading to a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch. He later tried to provide his perspective with more knowledge, but maybe it was too late.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: the girlfriend's trauma history, the sensitivity of the topic given her background, and the author's lack of prior research and consideration. He brought up a potentially triggering subject without understanding its impact on her. Even though he had good intentions, he didn't take into account how it might affect her. The #MeToo stance she has aligns with the controversy, which is about consent and power dynamics in the song. By not being more cautious and instead arguing his point with limited understanding, he likely caused emotional harm.\n\nThe author should have considered her trauma before discussing the song. He didn't check if she was comfortable with the topic, and his initial approach was to debate rather than empathize. Even after realizing he might have been insensitive, he tried to push his argument again, which could have been even more hurtful. The result was a ruined weekend and a conflict that could have been avoided with more sensitivity and research.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might trigger them. The author's failure to do so and his approach to the conversation likely made the situation worse. So, the answer here is that the author is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's emotional well-being and acted without sufficient consideration of her perspective.\n"
