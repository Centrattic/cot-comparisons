She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has a history of complex PTSD and a traumatic past, including rape and an abortion. The key points here are understanding the context of the girlfriend's trauma and whether the author's actions were insensitive or not.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past relationships. That's a significant red flag. When someone has such a history, certain topics might trigger them. The song in question has been criticized for being non-consensual, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. Given her background, bringing up this controversy without being aware of how it might affect her seems like a mistake.\n\nThe author says he was making small talk and expected a casual conversation but ended up causing a big reaction. He tried to explain his views but didn't have much evidence, just a gut feeling and a quick read. That lack of preparation and sensitivity is problematic. He acknowledges that he didn't do enough research into the song's history and context before discussing it, which shows he may have been careless.\n\nHe also mentions that he wanted his girlfriend to understand his perspective but ended up not considering her feelings first. The result was a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch. Even after realizing his mistake, he tried to re-enter the conversation with more knowledge, but the initial approach was flawed.\n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have a history of trauma, it's crucial to approach topics carefully. The fact that he brought up something that could be so triggering without considering her past shows a lack of empathy. The #MeToo movement emphasizes consent and respect, which aligns with her stance. His argument that the song's removal was excessive might be his personal opinion, but introducing it without understanding her perspective led to conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was bringing up a potentially triggering topic without being aware of his girlfriend's trauma, not doing sufficient research beforehand, and not prioritizing her feelings. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
