She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The key points here are the context provided: the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and a past traumatic experience involving rape and an abortion. The author mentions that he didn't do much research before bringing up the topic, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma. Since she has a history of complex PTSD, certain topics might be particularly sensitive for her. The song's controversy is tied to themes of consent and pressure, which could trigger her given her past. The author's intention was to make small talk, but he didn't consider how the topic might affect her. Even though he later tried to explain his perspective, the initial approach lacked sensitivity.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he didn't take the time to understand her potential triggers. Even though he later researched and tried to explain his stance, the initial bringing up of the topic without awareness of her trauma could be seen as the issue. The fact that she had a strong reaction indicates that the topic is highly sensitive for her. The author's justification of looking at a broader picture and historical context doesn't outweigh the immediate emotional impact on his partner. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent; he was making small talk. However, given her history, he should have been more cautious. The problem might be that he didn't prioritize her feelings in that moment, even if he later tried to explain his viewpoint. The key here is the lack of prior awareness and consideration of her trauma when choosing the topic of conversation.\n\nSo, weighing the intent against the impact, the impact here is significant (sleeping on the couch, shouting match), which suggests that the author's actions were indeed inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
