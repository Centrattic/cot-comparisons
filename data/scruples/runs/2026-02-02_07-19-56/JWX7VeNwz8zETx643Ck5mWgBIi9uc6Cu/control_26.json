She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend, who has complex PTSD from past trauma, including sexual assault and an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend has a history of trauma, especially related to being raped and having an abortion. She's aligned with the #MeToo movement, which focuses on addressing sexual harassment and assault. The song in question has been controversial because some interpret it as a man trying to seduce a woman, which could trigger people with similar experiences. The author brings this up as small talk but ends up causing an argument because he didn't consider her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The girlfriend's trauma history makes her more sensitive to issues related to consent and unwanted advances. 2) The author brought up a topic without knowing her personal connection to it. 3) He tried to defend the song's removal but didn't do thorough research beforehand, relying on a cursory read. 4) He continued to push his viewpoint even after causing a conflict, leading to a shouting match.\n\nIn relationships, especially with someone who has trauma, it's crucial to be considerate of their triggers. The author might have known about her history but didn't think about how the topic could affect her. Even if he had a different opinion, the way he approached the conversation\u2014without researching the song's history and being insensitive to her feelings\u2014could be seen as wrong. He also didn't back down initially, which escalated the situation. \n\nHowever, he did make an effort afterward to understand better and try to explain his stance with more knowledge. But the initial action of bringing up a potentially triggering topic without considering her trauma might still be inconsiderate. The question is whether his actions were wrong despite his intention to explain his perspective.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the focus is on whether the person's actions were thoughtless or hurtful. Here, the author's lack of awareness of the girlfriend's specific trauma and pushing his view without considering her feelings likely makes him at fault. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, was the topic brought up in a way that's unavoidable? The song is a Christmas classic, so maybe he didn't realize the connection. But given her history, he should have been more cautious. Also, he didn't apologize immediately and tried to explain further, which might not help. So overall, A makes sense.\n"
