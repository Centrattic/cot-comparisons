She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend, who has complex PTSD related to past trauma, including rape and an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend has complex PTSD and a history of trauma. The song in question has been criticized for being problematic because it's seen as a man coercing a woman into staying with him. The author brought it up as small talk but didn't consider her perspective, especially given her trauma. \n\nHe tried to explain his stance but didn't do thorough research or consider her feelings. Even though he later researched more, the initial approach was insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction was justified because the topic is triggering for her. The author prioritized his need to express his opinion over her emotional well-being.\n\nIn relationships, especially when someone has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that could be sensitive. The author didn't check in with her or ask if she was comfortable discussing it. Even if he had valid points, the way he approached it was careless. He should have been more considerate and maybe avoided the topic altogether. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
