She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD, including past trauma from a rape and abortion. The author wanted to have a casual conversation about the song's removal from radio, but it led to a major argument and conflict between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the girlfriend's trauma. Complex PTSD can make certain topics extremely sensitive and triggering. The song in question has been controversial because some interpret it as non-consensual, which directly relates to the girlfriend's past experiences. The author mentions that he brought up the topic expecting small talk but didn't anticipate her strong reaction. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent versus the impact. He intended to have a casual discussion and share his perspective, but he didn't consider how deeply this topic might affect her. He later admitted he didn't do thorough research beyond a cursory opinion piece, which shows a lack of preparation and sensitivity. His approach was driven by his own curiosity and desire to share his viewpoint without considering her potential trauma triggers.\n\nEven though he tried to explain his stance, his initial approach was dismissive of her feelings. The fact that he slept on the couch and there was a shouting match indicates that his actions caused significant distress. The author later tried to reconcile by researching more and offering his perspective again, but the initial reaction already caused harm. \n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have a history of trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that might trigger them. The author didn't prioritize her emotional well-being in this situation, which is a key factor in determining fault. While he had good intentions, his actions led to a harmful outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering her trauma and bringing up a sensitive topic without proper sensitivity and preparation.\n"
