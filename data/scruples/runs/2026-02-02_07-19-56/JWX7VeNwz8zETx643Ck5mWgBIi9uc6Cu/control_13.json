She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including a rape and abortion. The author mentions that he brought it up as small talk, not expecting a big reaction. He tried to explain his viewpoint but ended up causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's history with trauma is significant. Topics that might seem like small talk to one person could be triggering for someone with PTSD. The song in question has been controversial because some see it as a potential rape culture element, given the lyrics where a man persuades a woman to stay. Given her past, this would naturally be a sensitive subject for her.\n\nThe author acknowledges that he didn't do thorough research before bringing it up. He based his opinion on a cursory read and his gut. That's a problem because he didn't consider the depth of his girlfriend's trauma. Even if he had a valid point about the song's removal, the way he approached it was insensitive. He didn't prioritize her feelings or her history, which he should have known about since they've been together four years.\n\nHe also tried to argue his point instead of backing down. That's a mistake because in such situations, it's important to listen and validate the other person's feelings first. His attempt to explain his stance without understanding her perspective could have made her feel dismissed. The fact that he ended up on the couch and there was a shouting match suggests that his actions caused significant distress.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The topic is inherently sensitive given her trauma. 2) He didn't do proper research or consider her feelings beforehand. 3) He responded poorly during the conversation instead of empathizing. \n\nEven though he later tried to understand more, the initial approach was flawed. People in relationships need to be aware of each other's triggers and handle them with care. Bringing up a controversial topic without knowing it's a trigger shows a lack of consideration. So, the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
