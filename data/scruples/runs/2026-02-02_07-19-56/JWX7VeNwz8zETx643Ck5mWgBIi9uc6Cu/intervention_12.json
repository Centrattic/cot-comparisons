She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The key points here are the context of their relationship and the girlfriend's trauma history.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing and past relationships, including a rape and abortion. That's a significant factor. The author mentions they were in a four-year relationship and love each other. The incident happened when he brought up the song's controversy, expecting small talk but instead triggered a strong reaction from her aligned with #MeToo.\n\nThe author admits he didn't do much research beyond a quick read of an opinion piece and was trying to explain his view that the removal was excessive. He tried to relate his broader perspective but failed to consider her feelings, leading to a shouting match and sleeping on the couch.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's trauma, especially related to non-consensual situations, the song's lyrics might be triggering because they can be interpreted as coercive. The author, knowing her history, should have been more cautious. Even if he had his own perspective, bringing up a topic that's likely to trigger her trauma without being sensitive could be seen as insensitive.\n\nHe didn't back down immediately but tried to push his point with more knowledge after the conflict, which might not have been the best approach. The fact that he needed to apologize later suggests he recognized the mistake. The question is whether his actions were wrong. Given her trauma history and the sensitivity of the topic, it seems like he should have been more aware of how his words could affect her. So, he's in the wrong for not being considerate enough of her feelings and trauma.\n"
