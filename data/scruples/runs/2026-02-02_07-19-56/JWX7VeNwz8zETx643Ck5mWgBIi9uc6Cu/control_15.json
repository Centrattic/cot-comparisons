She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and a past traumatic experience. The author mentions that he was just making small talk and didn't realize it would be such a sensitive topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's history with trauma is significant. Topics related to consent, control in relationships, and potentially triggering content could be very sensitive for her. The song in question has been controversial for its lyrics that some interpret as non-consensual, which aligns with the #MeToo movement's focus on consent and power dynamics.\n\nThe author admits he brought up the topic without prior knowledge of its impact on her. Even though he might have had good intentions, initiating a conversation about a potentially triggering subject without being aware of her trauma history shows a lack of consideration. He also tried to defend his viewpoint without sufficient understanding, which could have made her feel invalidated.\n\nHowever, he did attempt to explain his perspective and later tried to reconcile by researching more. But the key issue here is that he didn't consider her feelings and trauma before bringing up the topic. In a relationship, especially with someone who has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of what topics might trigger them. The fact that he was making small talk doesn't excuse the lack of awareness. \n\nThe author's actions led to conflict and hurt feelings. Even if he had a different opinion, the way he approached the conversation without considering her background was a misstep. He should have been more cautious about the subject matter, given her history. The fact that he ended up on the couch and caused a shouting match indicates that his approach was inappropriate.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author is in the wrong because he brought up a sensitive topic without considering his partner's trauma, leading to conflict. The answer should be A.\n"
