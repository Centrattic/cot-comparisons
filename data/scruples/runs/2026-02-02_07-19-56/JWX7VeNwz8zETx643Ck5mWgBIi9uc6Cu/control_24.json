She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context mentions that his girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and a past traumatic experience. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the importance of the topic. The song's controversy is about consent and power dynamics, which are core issues in the #MeToo movement. Given the girlfriend's history, bringing up this topic might trigger her trauma.\n\nThe author mentions he brought it up as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but got an intense reaction. He tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't have much evidence, just a gut feeling and a quick read. This shows he didn't do thorough research, which could have revealed the potential sensitivity of the topic.\n\nHe also tried to defend his stance instead of backing down, leading to a shouting match. Even after sleeping on the couch, he decided to bring it up again, which might not be the best approach when someone is upset. The fact that he caused a conflict and ruined their weekend suggests that his actions had negative consequences, especially considering her trauma history.\n\nIn relationships, especially when a partner has a history of trauma, it's crucial to be sensitive to their triggers. The author didn't consider how his choice of topic might affect her, which shows a lack of awareness. While he might have had good intentions to discuss, the timing and approach were problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely didn't mean harm but failed to consider his girlfriend's emotional state and past experiences. His actions were insensitive and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
