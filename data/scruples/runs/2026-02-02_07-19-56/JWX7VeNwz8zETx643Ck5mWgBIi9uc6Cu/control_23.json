She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by carefully reading the context provided.\n\nThe author is a partner in a four-year relationship. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past experiences, including being raped and having an abortion. The author brought up the controversy around the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" which was pulled from radio play due to its lyrics being seen as non-consensual. The author expected small talk but the girlfriend was very upset, aligning with #MeToo. The author tried to explain their view that the song's removal was excessive, but didn't do much research beforehand. They ended up sleeping on the couch after a shouting match. The next day, they tried again with more knowledge but it didn't help.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the girlfriend's history and the sensitivity of the topic. The author knew about her trauma and past experiences, yet brought up a song that's directly related to issues of consent and non-consensual interactions, which could trigger her. The author didn't do thorough research before discussing it, which shows a lack of consideration. Even though they tried to explain their stance, the initial decision to bring up such a sensitive topic without understanding the emotional impact on their partner seems misguided. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given her history. The author's approach was to present their view without acknowledging her trauma first, which likely made her feel invalidated. The fact that they had to apologize later and it caused significant conflict suggests that the approach was wrong. So, the answer here would be that the author is in the wrong. They should have considered her trauma and approached the topic differently, if at all. The main issue is not the topic itself but how it was handled without sensitivity to her past.\n"
