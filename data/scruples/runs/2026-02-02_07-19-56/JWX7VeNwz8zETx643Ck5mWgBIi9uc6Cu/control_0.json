She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, past relationships, including being raped and having an abortion. He brings up the controversy, expecting small talk, but it escalates because her views align with #MeToo. He admits he didn't do much research and now feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma makes her sensitive to certain topics. The author knew her history but still brought up a potentially triggering issue without understanding her perspective. Even though he had his reasons for discussing the song's history, he didn't consider how it might affect her. He tried to explain his stance but didn't back it up with thorough research, which might have shown he wasn't fully informed. He also mentions sleeping on the couch and a shouting match, indicating the conversation was hurtful. His follow-up attempt to explain his view with more knowledge came after the conflict, which might have been too late. The key points are his lack of empathy, insufficient research, and triggering a sensitive topic without considering her feelings. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize her emotional well-being despite knowing her history.\n"
