She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing and past relationships, including a rape and an abortion. The author brought up the song controversy, which is related to #MeToo issues. The song was pulled because some see it as problematic due to the lyrics implying coercion. The author expected small talk but it escalated into a conflict.\n\nThe author admits he didn't do much research before bringing it up, relied on a cursory read and his gut. He tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't consider how it might affect his girlfriend's trauma. The girlfriend's reaction was strong, leading to a shouting match and the author sleeping on the couch.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's history, bringing up a topic that's tied to trauma without being sensitive or informed seems insensitive. The author didn't check his girlfriend's triggers or the emotional weight of the subject. Even though he had his own perspective, he should have prioritized her well-being. The fact that he tried to explain his viewpoint without backing down immediately shows he might not have fully considered her feelings. The outcome was a ruined weekend and ongoing conflict.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not being aware of his girlfriend's trauma history and bringing up a sensitive topic without proper understanding. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
