She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, they brought up the controversy around the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" with their girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including being raped and having an abortion. The author was making small talk, expecting a casual conversation, but it escalated into a big argument. The author defended the song's removal as being excessive, but the girlfriend felt it was a #MeToo issue. The author later tried to explain their perspective better after doing some more research, but it didn't help, and they ended up on the couch.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has significant trauma, especially around situations that could be triggering. The song in question has been criticized for being non-consensual or coercive, which aligns with the #MeToo movement. The author didn't consider the potential impact of bringing up such a sensitive topic, especially without having done thorough research. They mentioned they just read a cursory opinion piece and went in with their gut. That seems like they didn't take the time to understand the deeper issues involved, which is a problem when discussing topics that could be so emotionally charged for someone with a history of trauma.\n\nEven though the author's intention was to have small talk and explore the song's history, they failed to consider their girlfriend's emotional state and past experiences. The fact that the girlfriend reacted strongly shows that the topic was indeed a trigger for her. The author's approach was to defend their viewpoint rather than listen and validate her feelings. They admitted their attempt to relate was poor, which probably made the situation worse. The key here is whether the author should have known better, given the girlfriend's history. Since they knew about her complex PTSD and past trauma, bringing up a topic that could be triggering without considering the context shows a lack of sensitivity and awareness.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't back down or apologize immediately, choosing instead to try to explain their stance further. This might have been perceived as dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable given her background, and the author's continued insistence on their viewpoint without considering her trauma could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author had good intentions, the outcome was harmful to the relationship and the girlfriend's emotional well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being mindful of the girlfriend's trauma and for not respecting her feelings in the conversation.\n"
