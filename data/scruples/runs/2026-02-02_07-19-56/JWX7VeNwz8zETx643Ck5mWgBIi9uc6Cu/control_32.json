She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The key points here are about sensitivity and communication in a relationship, especially when one partner has trauma.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend's views align with #MeToo, which emphasizes consent and power dynamics. The song in question has been criticized for its coercive lyrics, which can be seen as problematic in the context of consent. The author brought up the controversy as small talk but didn't consider how it might affect his girlfriend given her trauma. That seems like a misstep. Even if he had good intentions, he didn't take into account her history and how the topic could trigger her.\n\nThe author tried to defend his stance by talking about historical context and broader perspectives, but he did so without sufficient prior research and without considering her feelings. It's clear he realized his mistake later when he looked into the song's history more deeply. However, the initial conversation was poorly handled, leading to conflict and her sleeping on the couch. His decision to try to explain his viewpoint further after the argument might not be the best approach; sometimes, it's better to listen and validate first, especially in sensitive situations.\n\nThe fact that he didn't back down and instead tried to re-enter the conversation with more info suggests he didn't fully grasp the emotional impact of his actions. In relationships where one partner has trauma, it's crucial to approach topics that could be triggering with caution and empathy. The author's failure to do so here indicates he was in the wrong for not prioritizing her emotional well-being over his desire to discuss the controversy.\n"
