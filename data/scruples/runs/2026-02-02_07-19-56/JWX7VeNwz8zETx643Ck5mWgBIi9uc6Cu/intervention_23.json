She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing, a past relationship where she was raped, and an abortion. These are significant trauma points, especially related to consent and control, which the #MeToo movement addresses. \n\nThe author mentions that he brought up the controversy as small talk, expecting a casual conversation but instead got a strong reaction. He defends his stance by saying he wasn't aware of the deeper implications and was just interested in the history of the song. However, he admits to not doing proper research before discussing it, which might have been a mistake.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend's trauma history, the sensitive nature of the topic, and the author's lack of preparation in discussing it. The song's controversy is about the lyrics being seen as non-consensual, which directly ties into the girlfriend's experiences. Even if the author had his own perspective, introducing such a topic without considering her triggers was likely insensitive.\n\nHe tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't take the time to understand her perspective or the song's problematic aspects beforehand. His approach was to defend his opinion rather than listen, which could have made her feel invalidated. The fact that he ended up on the couch and caused a shouting match shows the impact of his actions.\n\nWhile he did later do more research and tried to reconcile, the initial approach was flawed. The mistake was in bringing up a sensitive subject without being aware of how it might affect her. Even if his intention was small talk, the subject matter was too charged given her history. The author's failure to recognize the potential harm and his lack of preparation contribute to being in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
