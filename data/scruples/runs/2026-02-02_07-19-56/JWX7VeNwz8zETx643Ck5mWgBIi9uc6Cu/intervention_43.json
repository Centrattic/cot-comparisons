She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The context given is that the girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her upbringing and past trauma, including a rape and an abortion. The author tried to discuss the song's controversy, expecting small talk, but it led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma. She's dealing with complex PTSD, which means certain topics might trigger her. The song's controversy is related to consent, which is a sensitive issue given her history. The author brought it up without considering how it might affect her, even though he later tried to explain his stance. \n\nHe mentions he didn't do any thorough research before bringing up the topic, just read an opinion piece. That might have contributed to his misunderstanding of the issue. Also, he tried to argue against the song's removal, which could be seen as dismissive of the #MeToo movement's concerns. \n\nThe author's intention was to share his perspective, but he didn't take into account the emotional impact on his partner. Even if he had good intentions, the timing and topic were inconsiderate. He ended up causing a conflict and hurting her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, especially with partners who have trauma, it's important to be mindful of triggers. The author should have been more empathetic and checked in with her feelings before discussing such a sensitive topic. His attempt to explain his viewpoint afterward didn't happen until after the conflict, which might have been too late. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's trauma and brought up a topic that was emotionally charged for her without proper sensitivity.\n"
