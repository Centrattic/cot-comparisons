She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy was a mistake, given their girlfriend's history with trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing and a past relationship where she was raped and had an abortion. The author mentions that he just brought up the song controversy as small talk without doing much research, expecting a casual conversation but got a strong reaction. The song has been controversial, with some viewing it as non-consensual, which aligns with #MeToo themes. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, leading to arguments and him sleeping on the couch.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the author's lack of awareness or preparation before discussing a sensitive topic. The author admits he didn't do thorough research, only a cursory read of an opinion piece. That's a red flag because when someone has a history of trauma, especially related to issues like consent and sexual assault, it's crucial to approach such topics with care and empathy.\n\nThe author tried to explain his perspective but failed to validate her feelings, leading to conflict. He also mentions that he didn't want to trivialize her views but still pushed to explain his stance. This suggests that even though his intention was to share his viewpoint, he didn't prioritize her emotional well-being first.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has trauma, it's important to be mindful of triggers. The song controversy could be a trigger for the girlfriend given her history. The fact that the author didn't realize the potential impact until after the argument indicates a lack of consideration. Even if he had good intentions, not checking in with her feelings first and not being prepared to listen without pushing his own views could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe outcome\u2014sleeping on the couch and another shouting match\u2014shows that the conversation wasn't handled well. The author acknowledges that he should have backed down and apologized instead of trying to explain his position again. His approach was more about defending his viewpoint rather than supporting her, which is a sign of being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely didn't consider the emotional impact of bringing up a sensitive topic, especially without proper understanding and without prioritizing his partner's feelings. That makes me think the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
