She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with their girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from her upbringing and past trauma, including rape and an abortion. The author mentions that the girlfriend's stance is in line with #MeToo, and he probably shouldn't have brought it up. He tried to explain his perspective but didn't do it well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's trauma is significant. Discussing a song that's been linked to problematic themes might trigger her. The author, even if he had good intentions, didn't consider how this topic might affect her. He admits he didn't do thorough research and only had a cursory read. That's a red flag because he didn't take the time to understand the deeper context, which could have shown respect for her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intent was to make small talk and share his perspective, but the impact was negative because it brought up trauma. In relationships, especially with partners who have PTSD, it's crucial to be sensitive to their triggers. The fact that he slept on the couch and there was a shouting match suggests that his actions caused significant distress.\n\nAlso, the author later tried to explain his point of view with more knowledge, which is good, but the initial approach was flawed. He didn't back down and wait it out, which might have been a better strategy. Instead, he pushed further, leading to a worse outcome. \n\nIn #MeToo context, the song's lyrics have been criticized for depicting a non-consensual situation. The girlfriend's strong reaction aligns with that movement's principles. The author's defense that the removal was excessive doesn't account for the trauma of survivors. His position might come across as dismissive of their experiences, which is problematic.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author did have a good intention but failed to consider the emotional impact on his partner. In such cases, being mindful of the other person's trauma is more important than defending one's own viewpoint. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
