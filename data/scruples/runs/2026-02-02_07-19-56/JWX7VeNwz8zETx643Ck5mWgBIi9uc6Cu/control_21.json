She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD, including trauma from a past rape and abortion. The author mentions that he was just making small talk but ended up triggering her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has significant trauma related to being in relationships and possibly situations where she felt pressured. The song in question is controversial because some see it as a man coercing a woman into staying, which could be a trigger for someone with her background. The author was aware of the controversy but still brought it up without knowing her perspective. Even though he had good intentions and tried to explain his viewpoint, he didn't take into account her trauma.\n\nHe tried to explain his side by referencing an opinion piece and his broader perspective on song history, but that might have come across as dismissive. She was aligned with #MeToo, which emphasizes consent and power dynamics. The key here is whether he should have checked in with her before bringing up such a sensitive topic. Given her trauma history, it seems like he should have been more cautious. He also admits he didn't do thorough research before discussing it, which might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nHe tried to apologize the next day but still pushed his viewpoint, which might have made her feel unheard. The result was a shouting match and him sleeping on the couch. Even though he later did more research, the initial action was problematic. The question is whether bringing up the song without considering her trauma was wrong. Since he knew her history and the song's potential to trigger her, he should have avoided the topic or approached it with more sensitivity. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings and trauma first.\n"
