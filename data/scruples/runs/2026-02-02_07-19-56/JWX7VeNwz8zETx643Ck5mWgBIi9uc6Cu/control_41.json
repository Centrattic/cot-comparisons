She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has complex PTSD related to her past, including a rape and abortion. The author brought up the song controversy as small talk but ended up causing a big argument. The song has been criticized for being non-consensual, which aligns with #MeToo movements.\n\nThe author tried to explain his viewpoint but didn't do thorough research. He now realizes he might have been insensitive. The key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history and the author's lack of preparation before discussing a sensitive topic.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has trauma, it's crucial to be mindful of topics that can trigger them. The author didn't consider her emotional state and the potential impact of the song's message. Even if he had his own perspective, bringing up such a topic without understanding its context and her personal history seems like a mistake.\n\nHe also tried to argue his point without sufficient knowledge, which could have made her feel invalidated. The fact that he ended up on the couch and caused a shouting match shows the conversation was harmful. The author should have prioritized her feelings and chosen a different time or topic, or done more research to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. So, it seems like he's in the wrong here.\n"
