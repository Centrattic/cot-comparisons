She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a history of complex PTSD related to her upbringing, a past rape, and an abortion. The author mentions that he was just making small talk and didn't realize how sensitive the topic was for her. \n\nFirst, the main point is whether bringing up that specific song was a mistake. The song has been controversial because some people see it as a non-consensual interaction, which ties into the #MeToo movement. The author's girlfriend aligns with that perspective, so it's a touchy subject for her. The author, on the other hand, thought the removal of the song was excessive and wanted to discuss his view. But he didn't do much research and just brought it up in a casual conversation.\n\nThe key here is that the author didn't consider his girlfriend's trauma and history before bringing up the topic. He mentioned that if he had thought about it more, he probably wouldn't have brought it up. So he acknowledges that he should have been more mindful. Even though he tried to explain his stance, he didn't have solid evidence or deep understanding, which might have made the discussion more contentious.\n\nAlso, after the initial argument, he tried to revisit the topic with more knowledge, but that didn't go well either. The result was a shouting match, and he ended up on the couch. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nConsidering all that, the author didn't take into account his girlfriend's trauma and the sensitivity of the topic. He brought it up in a small talk context without understanding the potential impact. Even though he had his own views, the way he approached the conversation was careless. The fact that he later did some research but still tried to push his view might not have been the best approach either. So, the answer is likely A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong for not being considerate of her feelings and history before discussing the controversial topic.\n"
