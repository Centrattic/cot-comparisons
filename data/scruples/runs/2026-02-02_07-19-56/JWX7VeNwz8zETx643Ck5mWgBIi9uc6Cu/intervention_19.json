She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.\n\nLast night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. \n\nI attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.\n\nI didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.\n\nNeedless to say, I slept on the couch. \nI woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. \n\nI feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for bringing up the \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" controversy with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has complex PTSD from past trauma, including a past relationship where she was raped and had an abortion. The author brings up the song controversy, expecting small talk, but it leads to an argument and them sleeping separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's trauma. The song's controversy is about its lyrics being seen as non-consensual, which ties into #MeToo themes. Since his girlfriend has a history of trauma, bringing up this topic might trigger her, especially given her rape and abortion experience. The author admits he didn't do much research beyond a cursory read and a gut feeling, which might have led him to overlook how sensitive this topic is for her.\n\nHe tried to explain his stance, thinking it was about the broader picture and historical context, but his approach was poor. He didn't consider her feelings or the potential trigger. Even though his intention was to discuss, the timing and lack of sensitivity were likely the issues. He slept on the couch, and they had a shouting match, which suggests the conversation wasn't handled well. He later tried to explain again with more knowledge, but maybe it was too late.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's trauma history, the controversial topic's relevance to her past, and the author's failure to approach the discussion with empathy and preparation. The author's actions, while not malicious, were insensitive given her background. So, the answer would probably be that he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the context of her trauma before bringing up such a sensitive subject.\n"
