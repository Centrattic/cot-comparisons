The author wanted to keep the Reese's cups their mom bought and instead gave out old sour candies. The mom thought it was bad.\n\nHmm. So, first, Halloween is supposed to be a fun time for kids. Parents usually put effort into getting good treats. The author took the sour candy from the pantry, which might be old. Sour candy can be really strong for little kids, maybe even make them sick. Also, the author's mom bought the Reese's cups, but he wanted them for himself. That sounds selfish. Taking the mom's effort and replacing it with something else could be seen as inconsiderate. The kids might not like the sour candy, and their parents might be upset. The author didn't consider the kids' safety or their parents' expectations. So, yeah, it seems like the author did something wrong by being selfish and potentially putting kids at risk with old, super sour candy. That's probably why the mom was upset. So answer A.\n"
