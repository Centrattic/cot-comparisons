      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for giving out really sour candy to kids on Halloween. Their mom bought Reese's cups, but they wanted those for themselves, so they used old \"toxic waste\" candies from the pantry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, Halloween is about giving out treats, usually sweet things like candy. Using something that's super sour might be unpleasant for kids. Even if the candies are safe, they might be too harsh for little children, especially if they're not expecting it. Some kids might find it upsetting or even physically uncomfortable. Also, the author took the candies from the pantry without using what their mom bought, which shows a lack of consideration for her efforts. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to give out something that's not the standard treat and could be harmful. Even if the intentions were to keep the good candy for themselves, that's selfish and not treating the trick-or-treaters fairly. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
