      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving out super sour candy on Halloween. The author's mom bought regular candy, but the author wanted to keep the Reeses for themselves. Instead, they used old \"toxic waste\" candies they had. \n\nFirst, Halloween is about giving kids treats, so the expectation is that they'll get something they like. Sour candy that's \"insanely sour\" might be unpleasant for kids, especially since some might be very young or not used to that kind of candy. \n\nThe author's mom thinks they were being a jerk by doing this. The key points here are intent and the impact. The author wanted to keep the Reeses, so they substituted with something else. The sour candy might not be safe if it's expired, but the problem here is more about the action and the effect on the kids.\n\nEven if the sour candy isn't toxic, giving out something that's overly sour could be seen as a prank rather than a treat. It's possible some kids might not enjoy it or even get upset. The action of substituting the candy without considering the kids' experience shows a lack of consideration. \n\nAlso, the author's mom bought the Reeses, but the author took them for themselves. That's another point against the author. Using someone else's purchase for personal gain and then giving out a less desirable alternative could be seen as selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate towards the kids and also stole their own mom's candy. The answer would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
