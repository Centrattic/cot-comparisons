      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving out super sour candy to kids on Halloween instead of the regular candy their mom bought. The mom thought he was a dick because he took the Reese's cups for himself and used the old toxic waste candies. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is about giving out treats, usually sweet candies. Parents often go to the trouble of buying specific items like Reese's Cups for the kids. The author chose to use the sour candies instead, which might be unpleasant for the kids, even if they're not actually toxic. The term \"toxic waste\" suggests they're really sour, maybe even painful to eat.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent and impact. The author wanted the Reese's for himself, so he gave out the sour ones. The issue is whether this was inconsiderate or harmful. Even if the sour candy isn't dangerous, it's unexpected and could be a bad experience for young children who aren't prepared for such a strong sour taste. Parents might worry about their kids having a negative experience or even choking if the candy is hard. \n\nAlso, taking the better candy for oneself while giving the worst to trick-or-treaters is selfish. The mom's reaction is understandable because she invested time and money into getting the good candy, and the author undermined that. There's a social expectation that Halloween candy is enjoyable, so deviating from that could be seen as a breach of goodwill.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the sour candy isn't harmful and that the kids might just spit it out. But the intention to save the better candy for oneself shows a lack of consideration for both the kids and the mom's efforts. The term \"insanely sour\" could also be a red flag for parents who want to ensure their children have a positive experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and selfish, leading to a negative experience for the kids and causing conflict with the mom. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
