The mom bought Reese's Cups, but the author took the sour candy from the pantry instead. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time where kids expect treats, usually sweets. Giving out something that's really sour might be unpleasant for them, especially little kids who might not handle strong sour flavors well. It could cause them to cry or have a bad experience. \n\nThe mom is upset because the author didn't use the Reese's Cups she bought. The author's reason was wanting the Reese's for themselves. That seems selfish. Taking the candy that was intended for the kids because you want it is a bad move. \n\nAlso, the sour candy being \"toxic waste\" suggests it's extremely sour, which might be harmful or uncomfortable for children. Even if it's not actually toxic, the name implies it's very strong. Kids might not know how to handle that, leading to a negative experience.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position of responsibility during Halloween. Parents typically prepare treats for trick-or-treaters. Using the sour candy instead of the intended sweets shows a lack of consideration for the kids and the effort the mom put into buying the Reese's Cups. \n\nSo, the author's actions were both selfish and potentially harmful. They prioritized their own desire over the kids' enjoyment and safety. The mom's reaction is understandable because it's about taking care of the children. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
