      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who handed out super sour candy to kids on Halloween is in the wrong. The author's mom thinks they were a dick because they used the \"toxic waste\" candies instead of the Reese's cups. The author is conflicted because they wanted the Reese's for themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time when kids expect treats, usually sweet candies. Handing out something unexpectedly sour or potentially harmful, even if it's not actually toxic, could be seen as a prank or a mean act. The term \"toxic waste\" suggests it's extremely sour, which might cause discomfort or even a negative reaction in children, especially if they're not warned.\n\nThe author's motive was selfish\u2014they wanted the Reese's for themselves. That's a key point. Intentionally withholding the better candy and replacing it with something less desirable shows a lack of consideration for the children's experience. Parents and hosts have a responsibility to ensure that the treats are safe and appropriate. Even if the sour candy isn't dangerous, it's not the norm and could lead to complaints from parents or upset kids.\n\nAlso, the mom's reaction indicates that this behavior was not acceptable to her. The author's action could have been seen as stingy or inconsiderate. While it might not be a huge moral failing, it's definitely a breach of social norms for Halloween. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
