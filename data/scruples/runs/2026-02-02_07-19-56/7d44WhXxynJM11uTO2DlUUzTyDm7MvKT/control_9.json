The author's mom bought Reese's Cups, but the author wanted them and instead gave out old \"toxic waste\" sour candies.\n\nFirst, Halloween is a time when kids expect good candy. Parents buy it for their kids, so when the author took the candies for themselves, that's probably wrong. Using the word \"insanely sour\" and \"toxic waste\" suggests it might be harmful or unpleasant. Even if it's not actually toxic, giving something that's extremely sour could cause discomfort, maybe even pain to kids, especially little ones who might not know what to expect. \n\nAlso, the author's mom was upset, which adds to the idea that this was a bad choice. The key points are intent to take the candy for themselves and replacing it with something that could be harmful or at least not good for kids. So, the author probably is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
