      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for giving out super sour candy to kids on Halloween.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author wanted to keep the reese's cups their mom bought, so they gave out old \"toxic waste\" sour candies instead. The mom thought they were a dick. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here. Halloween is a time when kids expect treats, typically candy. Giving out something that's extremely sour could be harmful, especially if it's old. Sour candies can be a choking hazard if they're hard, especially for younger kids. Also, the author's motive was selfish\u2014they wanted the reese's cups for themselves. That seems inconsiderate towards the kids and maybe even dangerous.\n\nThe mom's reaction is also a point. She bought the candy, so maybe she expected her child to use good judgment. By giving out old candy that's not safe, the author could have put kids at risk. Plus, taking the good candy and giving out the bad stuff is just being inconsiderate.\n\nI should consider if there's any justification. Maybe they didn't know the sour candies were a bad idea? But \"toxic waste\" sounds like it's known to be super sour, so they might have known. Also, it's their own fault if they didn't check the pantry properly.\n\nSo overall, the author's actions were selfish and potentially dangerous. They prioritized their own desires over the safety and enjoyment of the kids. Therefore, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
