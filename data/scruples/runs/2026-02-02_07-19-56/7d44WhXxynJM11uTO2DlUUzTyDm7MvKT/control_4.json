      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for giving out really sour candy to kids on Halloween. Their mom bought regular candy, but they wanted the Reese's for themselves, so they used old \"toxic waste\" candies from the pantry.\n\nFirst, Halloween is about giving kids treats, usually sweet. The sour candy is described as \"insanely sour,\" which can be unpleasant or even harmful if a kid is not expecting it. Using old candy might not be safe either, but the main issue here is intent. The person wanted to keep the good candy and gave out something that's more of a prank. \n\nParents expect their kids to get safe, tasty treats. Giving something that's harsh or unexpected could be seen as a prank, which isn't kind. Also, using old candy that's past its prime could be a safety issue. The mom is upset because the person took the better candy for themselves and gave out something not suitable for kids. \n\nThe key points are: intent to keep better candy, giving out potentially harmful or unpleasant candy, and the mom's disapproval. So, the person's actions were selfish and inconsiderate, possibly endangering the kids. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
