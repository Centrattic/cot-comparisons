      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Halloween candy. The author says they wanted to keep the Reese's cups their mom bought and instead gave out old super sour candies called \"toxic waste.\" Their mom thought they were a dick for doing that.\n\nFirst, Halloween is a time when kids expect treats, usually candy. Parents often buy specific candies for trick-or-treaters. The author's mom bought Reese's cups, which are a common and popular choice. The author decided to use old sour candies instead. Now, sour candies can be strong, especially for kids who aren't used to them. The term \"toxic waste\" might even suggest they're really intense or possibly expired, which could be a safety issue.\n\nGiving out candy that's not the intended treats could be seen as misleading or even harmful if the sour candies cause discomfort. Kids might not know how strong they are and could end up with sore mouths or stomachaches. Also, taking the Reese's cups for oneself instead of handing them out shows a lack of consideration for the guests and the effort the mom put into preparing the candy.\n\nThe mom's reaction indicates she thought it was inappropriate. The author's action might be considered selfish and inconsiderate. Even if they wanted the Reese's, using old sour candy as a substitute without the kids or parents knowing could be seen as deceptive. Parents might not appreciate their kids getting something unexpected, especially if it's not safe or enjoyable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because they used subpar candy instead of the prepared treats, which could be considered inconsiderate and potentially harmful to the children. The correct answer is A.\n"
