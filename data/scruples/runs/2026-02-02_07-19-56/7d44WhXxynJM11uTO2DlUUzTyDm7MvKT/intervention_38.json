      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for giving out super sour candy on Halloween. Their mom bought Reese's Cups, but they wanted them for themselves, so they gave out the toxic waste candies instead. Hmm.\n\nFirst, Halloween is a time when kids come to the door expecting treats. Parents usually prepare safe, good-tasting candy. The author's mom bought specific candy, which implies they were intended for the kids. The author took those away and gave out something else that's known to be really sour and maybe even unpleasant. \n\nKids might find the sour candy uncomfortable or even cry from the taste. It's not just about not getting the candy they wanted; it's about giving them something that could cause a negative reaction. The author's motivation was selfish\u2014they wanted the Reese's Cups for themselves. That seems inconsiderate, especially towards children who are just collecting candy.\n\nAlso, the \"toxic waste\" candies are likely not appropriate for young kids. Sour candies can sometimes be harsh, and giving them en masse could be a problem. The author's action might have been a prank, but it wasn't harmless. The mom was upset because they thought it was inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering the context, the selfish motive, the potential harm to the children's experience, and the mom's disapproval, the author probably is in the wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
