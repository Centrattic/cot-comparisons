      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who handed out super sour candy on Halloween is in the wrong. The author's mom bought regular candy, but the author wanted the Reese's for themselves and instead gave out the sour candy they had stored. The question is whether this makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the implications of giving sour candy to kids. Sour candy can be very strong, especially the \"toxic waste\" type. Kids, especially little ones, might not be used to such intense flavors. It could cause discomfort, upset stomachs, or even choking hazards if not chewed properly. Plus, there's the aspect of trick-or-treating being a tradition where kids expect regular treats, so substituting with something unexpected might be seen as a prank or a mean trick. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have had the intention of saving the better candy for themselves. But the action of giving out potentially harmful candy, even if it's not illegal, could be considered unethical. It's about respecting others' expectations and ensuring their safety. The mother's reaction suggests she thought it was inappropriate because she had already purchased the proper candy. The author's decision to use the sour candy instead might be seen as selfish and potentially dangerous. \n\nAlso, there's a social contract during Halloween where people are supposed to give out treats to kids, not harmful items. Even if the sour candy isn't technically dangerous, it's a violation of that social norm. The kids might end up with an unpleasant experience, which could affect their enjoyment of the holiday. The author's mom seeing them as a \"dick\" indicates that the action was socially unacceptable.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author did act inconsiderately and irresponsibly, which could harm the children and break the trust parents have in Halloween treats. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
