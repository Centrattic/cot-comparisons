      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving out super sour candy on Halloween. The author's mom thinks they were a dick because they took the sour candy instead of the Reese's Cups she bought. The author wanted the Reese's for themselves, so they gave out the old sour candy.\n\nHmm, first, Halloween is about giving out treats, usually candy. Parents put time and money into buying good stuff for trick-or-treaters. Using sour candy that's described as \"toxic waste\" seems like a prank or a joke, but it could be mean or harmful. Kids might not expect such a strong reaction from the candy, and some might even get upset or have a bad experience. \n\nThe mom bought the Reese's Cups, which are a classic, kid-friendly treat. The author took them for themselves and substituted with something else that's not as nice. That could be seen as self-serving and not considering the kids. Also, the sour candy being old might be a safety issue. Even if it's not expired, some people might have allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients in those candies. \n\nIn terms of community expectations, on Halloween, it's customary to give out something that's enjoyable. Giving out something that's unexpectedly sour could be seen as a prank, but some people might find it cruel. There's also the aspect of trust\u2014kids go door to door expecting to get treats, not pranks. \n\nThe author's mom is upset because she wanted to provide a good experience for the kids, and the author undermined that by taking the better candy and giving out something else. So, it looks like the author prioritized their own desire for the Reese's over the kids' experience. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong here. They didn't consider the impact of their choice on the children and possibly broke the trust that Halloween is a time for nice treats. The sour candy could have caused discomfort, and using the mom's purchased candy for themselves without her consent is also selfish.\n"
