      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for giving out super sour candy to kids on Halloween. The author's mom bought reese's cups, but he wanted them for himself and instead used old sour candies. The mom thought he was a dick.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. Halloween is a time when kids expect treats, usually sweet things like candy. Giving out something that's extremely sour could be unpleasant or even harmful. The author had an alternative candy but chose not to use what his mom provided. That might come off as selfish or inconsiderate, especially towards children.\n\nThe key points here: the author's intention was to have the reese's cups for himself, which shows a lack of consideration for the guests (the kids). Using old sour candy instead could potentially cause discomfort or health issues. Even if the candy wasn't expired, the sourness might be too much for kids. Also, lying about what's in the bowl if he replaced the reese's cups could be deceptive.\n\nBut some might argue that it's not malicious intent. Maybe he thought the sour candy was okay. However, the fact that he substituted the candy without his mom's knowledge and for personal gain seems like a breach of trust and responsibility. Parents usually prepare treats for the event, and overriding that with his own choice shows disrespect towards his mom's effort.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the children, parents might not want their kids to have overly sour candy. It's a common expectation that trick-or-treaters get something sweet. Deviating from that expectation without a good reason could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted selfishly by keeping the reese's cups and replacing them with something potentially harmful, which could be seen as being an asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
