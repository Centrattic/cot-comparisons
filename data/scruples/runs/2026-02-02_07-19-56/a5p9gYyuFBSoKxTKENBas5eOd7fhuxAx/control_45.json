Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for being upset with her husband's statement to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, advising instead to watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, while her husband's side of the family brushes it off.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the content of the husband's statement. The advice given is to ignore what women say and focus on their behavior. This seems to generalize all women, including the mother (the author) and presumably other women. That's a broad generalization and can be seen as sexist because it's dismissive of women's words and intent.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on the sexist nature of the comment and its potential impact on their son and daughters. The husband's family dismissing it as correct doesn't make the statement less problematic. In fact, it's important to consider modern societal values where equality and respect are emphasized. Advising someone to disregard the input of an entire gender promotes harmful stereotypes and could lead to misunderstanding or disrespect in relationships.\n\nThe author isn't overstepping by being upset. She's addressing a harmful message that could affect her children's views on women and relationships. The husband's advice undermines her as a parent and sends conflicting messages to their son. The fact that the son was coming to her for advice adds another layer, as the husband's comment could discredit her guidance.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is justified in her anger. The husband's statement is indeed sexist and harmful, so the answer is no, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
