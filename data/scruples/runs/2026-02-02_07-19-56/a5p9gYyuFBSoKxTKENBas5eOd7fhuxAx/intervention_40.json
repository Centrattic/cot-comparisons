Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her husband's comment. The husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, advising instead to watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially affecting their daughters. Her family, including brothers and dad, laughed it off, but she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the husband's statement. Telling a son not to listen to women is inherently problematic. It promotes a sexist viewpoint that undermines women's words and advice. This kind of advice could lead the son to devalue women's communication, which is harmful. The fact that the father is dismissing the mother's advice directly adds to the issue, as it's disrespectful to her both as a parent and a woman.\n\nThen there's the context: the son is starting to date, and the mother has been advising him. The father's comment invalidates her role in guiding their son. This could create a double standard where the son gets conflicting messages about respecting women's advice. Also, the author is concerned about their daughters, which shows she's thinking about the broader impact of such a statement.\n\nThe husband's family laughing it off suggests a cultural or familial acceptance of such views, but that doesn't make the statement right. The author's reaction is about recognizing the potential harm and wanting to address it. She's not overreacting if she's concerned about instilling respectful values in her children.\n\nSo, considering the sexism in the husband's statement and the author's valid concerns about the message sent to their children, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. Her perspective is about promoting equality and respect, which are important values. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
