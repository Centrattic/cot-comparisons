Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's advice to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, to instead watch their behavior and adjust his actions accordingly. The wife finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering their daughters. The husband's side, along with the wife's family (brothers and dad), dismissed her reaction, saying her husband was right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The husband's statement is promoting a view that women's words aren't reliable and that actions (presumably of women) are more important. This can be seen as sexist because it undermines women's communication and implies that their words are not trustworthy. The wife is upset because this advice could negatively influence their son's perception of women and potentially affect their daughters as well. \n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is wrong for being upset. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nLooking at the husband's statement, it's important to consider societal norms and gender equality. Telling a son not to listen to women reinforces stereotypes that women are deceitful or untrustworthy, which is a form of sexism. The wife's concern about the impact on their daughters is valid because such advice could imply that women's advice isn't valuable, which could affect how the daughters are treated by their brother or others.\n\nThe husband's family dismissing the wife's reaction might indicate a generational or cultural difference in views on gender equality. However, in modern contexts, promoting gender equality is widely accepted, and statements that demean one gender are generally considered problematic. \n\nThe wife's role in advising her son and then being contradicted by her husband adds to the conflict. If the husband undermines her advice, it could create confusion for the son and diminish the wife's authority. This could also affect the family dynamics, making the wife feel disrespected.\n\nConsidering all these points, the husband's statement is indeed problematic and sexist. The wife's reaction is justified because she's concerned about the negative implications of such advice. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B.\n"
