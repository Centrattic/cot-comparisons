Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset about her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, advising him to watch their actions instead.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the husband's statement. Saying not to listen to women is clearly dismissive and sexist. It undermines the value of women's words and advice, which is problematic. The author is upset because this affects both her as a mother and the daughters in the family. The husband's advice could instill in the son that women's opinions aren't reliable, which is harmful.\n\nThe user's brothers and dad laughed it off, but that doesn't make the comment okay. Family opinions don't validate sexist behavior. The author is concerned about the message this sends to her children, especially the daughters, which is valid. The husband's statement can perpetuate gender stereotypes and disrespect towards women. \n\nThe author isn't overreacting here. Being upset about sexist behavior from a spouse, especially directed at their children, is a legitimate reaction. She's trying to protect her children from harmful ideologies. The fact that others are dismissing her concerns doesn't negate her feelings or the validity of the issue. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The husband's comment was sexist and harmful, and her reaction is justified.\n"
