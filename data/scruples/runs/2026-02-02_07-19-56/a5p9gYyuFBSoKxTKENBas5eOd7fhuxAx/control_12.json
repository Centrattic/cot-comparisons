Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after her husband told their son not to listen to women. The husband's advice is clearly sexist, right? He's telling the son to disregard what women say and instead focus on their actions. The author is upset because this is dismissive of her advice and undermines her as a woman. She also mentions her daughters, implying that this advice is harmful for them too.\n\nThe husband's statement promotes a patriarchal view that women's words aren't reliable, which is definitely problematic. The author's reaction is about standing up against sexism, which is a valid concern. Her family members laughed it off, but that doesn't make the husband's comment right. The author isn't overreacting; she's addressing harmful behavior that can affect her children's views on gender equality.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's actions are the issue here, and the author is justified in her outrage.\n"
