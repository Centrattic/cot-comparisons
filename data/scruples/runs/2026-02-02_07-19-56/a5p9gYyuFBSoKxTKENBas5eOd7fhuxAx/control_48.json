Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told their son not to listen to women and instead watch their actions. The author thinks this is sexist and dismissive, especially since she's the one giving advice to their son, and there are daughters involved.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the husband's statement. He's advising the son to ignore what women say and focus on their actions. That seems sexist because it's generalizing all women as not trustworthy, which is a harmful stereotype. The author is right to be upset because it's not just about her but about perpetuating gender bias. The father's advice could affect how the son views all women, including his mother and sisters, which is problematic.\n\nThe author's brothers and dad dismiss her concerns, which might add to her feeling isolated. But that doesn't mean she's wrong. The husband's comment is promoting a double standard, implying that women's words aren't reliable. This could lead the son to devalue women's communication, which is harmful.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is B (No). The husband's statement is sexist and harmful, so the author isn't overreacting. She's valid in her anger because it affects their children's views on gender equality. The fact that other male relatives laughed it off doesn't justify the husband's words. The author is right to address this and concerned about the message it sends to all their kids. So, the answer should be B.\n"
