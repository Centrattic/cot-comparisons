Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women and to focus on what they do instead. The author is upset because she feels this is sexist and dismissive of her as a mother and a woman. Her family members, like her brothers and dad, laughed it off and agreed with the husband's statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband's statement is indeed sexist. Telling a son not to listen to women sends a harmful message that women's words are not reliable or trustworthy. This reinforces gender stereotypes and undermines the value of women's input. The author's reaction is about being upset that her advice was dismissed and that her son might internalize this sexist belief. \n\nThe husband's family agreeing with him doesn't make his statement correct. Just because others support it doesn't negate the fact that it's a problematic statement. The author's concern about the impact on their daughters is valid. Teaching the son to disregard women's advice could affect how he treats all women, including his sisters.\n\nThe key points here are the promotion of gender bias, the dismissal of the author's role as a parent, and the potential long-term effects on the son's behavior. The author is justified in feeling wronged because the husband's advice perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B.\n"
