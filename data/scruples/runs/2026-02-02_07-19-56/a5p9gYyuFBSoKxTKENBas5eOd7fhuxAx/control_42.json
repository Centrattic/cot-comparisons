Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing on their actions instead of their words. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially since she's the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's statement generalizes all women, suggesting that their advice isn't trustworthy. That's a broad stereotype. The author is upset because this undermines her role as a parent and sends a harmful message to their son about respecting women. Her brothers and dad downplay the comment, but the author's perspective is valid.\n\nThe husband's advice could lead the son to disregard his mother's advice, which is problematic. It also doesn't consider that women's words can be valuable. The fact that the author is the one giving advice to the son adds to the issue since the husband is invalidating her input. The mention of their daughters makes the author concerned about how this advice might affect them as well.\n\nThe key points here are gender stereotypes, respect in parenting, and the impact of such advice on children. The husband's comment promotes sexist views, which the author rightly objects to. The family members who laughed it off are in the wrong for dismissing her concerns. Therefore, the author isn't overreacting; she's standing up against a harmful statement. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
