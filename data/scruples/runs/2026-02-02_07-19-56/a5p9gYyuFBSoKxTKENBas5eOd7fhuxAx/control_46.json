Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son.\n\nFirst, the husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women and to focus on their actions instead. The author is upset about this, calling it sexist and dismissive. Her husband and her father and brothers think he was right. The question is if her reaction is justified.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the husband's advice and the implications. The husband's statement generalizes all women, suggesting that their words aren't reliable and only their actions matter. This perpetuates a stereotype that women are untrustworthy, which is a classic sexist trope. It also undermines the author's authority as a parent, as the husband dismissed her advice. \n\nThe author is concerned about the message this sends to their son and potential daughters. Teaching a son to distrust women based on gender is harmful and promotes gender bias. It's important to encourage mutual respect and listening in relationships, regardless of gender. The fact that the husband and his family are dismissive of the author's concerns might indicate a broader issue with their attitudes towards gender equality.\n\nThere's no context provided that would justify the husband's comment. The advice given is not about critical thinking or observing actions in general, but specifically about women. This targeted advice is problematic. The author's outrage stems from valid concerns about sexism and the impact on her children. She's advocating for a respectful and equitable approach, which is reasonable.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not overreacting. The husband's statement is sexist, and her reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
