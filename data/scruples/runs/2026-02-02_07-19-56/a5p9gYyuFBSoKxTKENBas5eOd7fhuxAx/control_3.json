Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after being upset that her husband told their son not to listen to women. \n\nFirst, the husband's statement: \"never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do...\" That definitely sounds sexist. He's generalizing all women, which is a problem. The author is upset because he's dismissing her advice and potentially influencing their son with a harmful stereotype.\n\nThe son is 15 and starting to date, so the advice he's getting from his father is shaping his views. The husband's comment could lead the son to undervalue women's input, which isn't healthy. The author is concerned not just for her own advice being ignored but also for the daughters, implying that this applies to all women, which is problematic.\n\nThe husband's family (brothers and dad) laughed it off, but that doesn't make it right. The author's reaction is about being a woman and the message it sends. The husband's advice is dismissive and perpetuates gender stereotypes. \n\nThe author isn't overreacting because the statement is inherently sexist. There's no justification for generalizing all women in that way. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
