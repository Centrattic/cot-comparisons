Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's advice to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing on their actions instead. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering she's the mother and they have daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the husband's statement is indeed problematic. Saying not to listen to women can be seen as sexist because it generalizes all women as untrustworthy based on their words. That's a big generalization and undermines the value of women's advice and communication. The husband's advice might be coming from a place of trying to protect his son, but the method is flawed.\n\nThe author is upset because it's dismissive of her advice and her identity as a woman. Also, considering they have daughters, reinforcing such gender stereotypes could harm their perception of themselves and others. Her brothers and dad dismissing her reaction as overreaction is another layer, but that doesn't validate the husband's comment.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the statement itself is problematic. The husband's advice could lead the son to distrust women's communication, which isn't healthy. The author's concerns about the impact on their daughters are valid too. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The husband's statement is the issue here, not her reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
