Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, advising instead to watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering their daughters, but her family members think the husband was right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the husband's statement. He's advising the son to prioritize actions over words from women, which implies distrust towards women's communication. This can be seen as sexist because it generalizes all women as not trustworthy based on gender. It's a stereotype that undermines women's intentions and capabilities.\n\nThe author is upset because she feels this is sexist and harmful. She's concerned about how this advice affects both her son and their daughters. The husband's comment could promote a problematic view where women's words are not valued, which is a form of sexism. The fact that her family members dismissed her reaction might add to her feeling that she's overreacting, but that doesn't mean she's wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The husband's advice is problematic, so the author's reaction is valid. Therefore, the correct answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
