Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband telling their son not to listen to women, which the author finds sexist. The husband's advice was to \"never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do...\" and the author is upset because this undermines her advice and their daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the husband's statement. The advice given is problematic because it's generalizing all women, implying they can't be trusted. That's a classic sexist trope. The author is concerned about the message this sends to their son and daughters. The husband's side of the family is dismissing the author's reaction, but that doesn't make the advice right.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. Being told by a spouse to ignore their input in favor of another's, especially with a sexist undertone, is valid. The father's advice could affect how the son treats women and his perception of the mother. The author is advocating for respect and trust, which are important values.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's advice is sexist, the author is rightly concerned about the impact, and the family dismissing it doesn't negate the issue. The author isn't overreacting; the husband's statement is harmful. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
