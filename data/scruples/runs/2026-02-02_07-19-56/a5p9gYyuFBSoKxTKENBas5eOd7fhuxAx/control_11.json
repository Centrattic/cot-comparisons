Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women and to focus on their actions instead. The author feels it's sexist and dismissive, while her family members think the husband is right.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the husband's statement. The comment is clearly reinforcing a stereotype that women's words aren't reliable, which is a form of sexism. It undermines the value of women's advice and can teach the son to disregard women's input, which is problematic. The author is concerned about this, especially since they have daughters as well.\n\nThe husband's advice might stem from traditional views where men are seen as more authoritative, but that's not a justification. The author's reaction is about protecting her own worth and the message she's given her son. She's also worried about the impact on their daughters, which is valid because such attitudes can affect how girls perceive themselves.\n\nThe family members laughing it off and agreeing with the husband shows a lack of awareness about gender equality. The author isn't overreacting; she's recognizing harmful rhetoric. There's no evidence that the husband meant to be offensive, but the statement itself is sexist regardless of intent. \n\nSo, the author is right to be upset. The husband's comment is sexist, and she's not in the wrong for calling it out. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
