Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women and to focus on their actions instead. The author is upset because she finds this sexist and dismissive, especially since she's his mother and they also have daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband's advice is coming from a place of trying to give his son advice on relationships, but the way he frames it generalizes all women, which is a problem. The author is a woman and a parent, so his comment undermines her advice and his own wife. That's a key point. Also, the mention of daughters is important because the same advice could be harmful if applied to them, promoting stereotypes that women are not to be trusted verbally.\n\nThe husband's statement is a classic example of sexist advice. It perpetuates the idea that women are deceitful or not reliable, which is a harmful stereotype. Even if the intention was to teach the son to observe behavior, the way it's phrased targets women as a gender, not as individuals. The author's reaction is valid because it's not just about her own advice being dismissed but about the broader implications of such a statement on their son's view of women.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is overreacting. The husband's advice is problematic on multiple levels. The fact that the husband's own family laughed it off doesn't make it right. The author isn't just being sensitive; she's pointing out a harmful generalization that affects gender dynamics. She's also considering the impact on their daughters, which shows she's thinking about the broader family context.\n\nSo, the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong. Her husband's comment is sexist, and her being upset is a reasonable response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
