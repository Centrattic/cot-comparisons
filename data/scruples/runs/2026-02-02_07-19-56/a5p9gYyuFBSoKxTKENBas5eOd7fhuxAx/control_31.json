Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, just watch what they do. The author is upset, but the husband's side (her dad and brothers) think he's right.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The husband's comment is definitely gender-based. He's generalizing all women's advice as not to be trusted, which is a form of sexism. The author is upset because it's dismissive of her advice and undermines her. The husband's family doesn't see it as a problem, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the husband's statement is sexist, the author is justified in feeling disrespected, and the advice given to the son could lead to harmful views towards women. The husband's argument that \"just watch how they behave\" can perpetuate stereotypes and mistrust towards women. The author's concern about their daughters is valid too, as such advice could affect how the son treats women in general.\n\nSo, the author is not overreacting. The husband's statement is problematic, and the author is right to be upset. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
