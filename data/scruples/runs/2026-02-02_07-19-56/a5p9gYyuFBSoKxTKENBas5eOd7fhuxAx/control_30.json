Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women and to watch their behavior instead. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially as a mother. Others, like her brothers and dad, think the husband is right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the husband's statement is indeed sexist or problematic. The comment generalizes all women as unreliable based on their words, which is a stereotype. It's teaching the son to distrust women's words and focus on their actions. That seems like it promotes a harmful attitude, undermining women's communication and intentions.\n\nThe author's reaction is about being respected and concerned for her children. She's a parent, so her feelings are valid. The husband's advice could affect both sons and daughters, implying that women's advice isn't trustworthy. This could perpetuate gender stereotypes and affect how the son interacts with all women, not just his mother.\n\nThe user's brothers and dad dismissing her reaction might indicate a cultural or generational issue, but that doesn't validate the husband's comment. The author isn't overreacting; she's standing up against a harmful statement. There's no indication she's wrong here. The husband's comment is the issue, not her reaction. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
