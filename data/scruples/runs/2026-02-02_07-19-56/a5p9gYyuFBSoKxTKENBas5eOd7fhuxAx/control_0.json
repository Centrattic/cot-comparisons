Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her husband's comment. The husband told their son not to listen to women, just watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and her family dismisses her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's statement generalizes all women, implying that their words aren't trustworthy. That's a classic sexist trope. The author is upset because it's dismissive and could affect how her son treats women. Her concern about the daughters is valid too, as the advice could lead to unequal treatment.\n\nHer brothers and dad laughed it off, but that doesn't make the comment right. Family opinions don't determine what's appropriate. The author's reaction is about protecting her son from harmful stereotypes and ensuring he respects women. She's also standing up for herself as a woman being disrespected.\n\nSo, is she overreacting? Probably not. The husband's advice is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
