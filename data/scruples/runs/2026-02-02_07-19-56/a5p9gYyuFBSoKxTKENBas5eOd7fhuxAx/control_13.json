Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing instead on their actions. The author finds this sexist and harmful, especially considering their daughters. The husband's family laughed it off, but the author is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the husband's statement. He said not to listen to women, which is a generalization that could be seen as sexist. It dismisses the value of women's words and advice, implying that their actions are more trustworthy than their words. This can be harmful because it undermines communication and mutual respect in relationships. The author is concerned about the message it sends to their son, potentially perpetuating gender stereotypes and disrespect towards women.\n\nThe author's reaction is about standing up against sexism in her family. Her concern for her daughters is valid because such attitudes can affect how the son treats women in general. The husband's family dismissing the comment as correct might contribute to a toxic environment where sexist views are normalized.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. From a modern perspective, promoting equality and respecting everyone's words is important. The husband's advice could lead to the son not taking women's advice seriously, which is problematic. The author's anger is justified because she's advocating against harmful stereotypes and ensuring her children are taught respect and equality.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
