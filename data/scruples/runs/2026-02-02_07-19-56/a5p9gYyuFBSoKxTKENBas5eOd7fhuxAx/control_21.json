Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is that the author's husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, advising him to focus on their actions instead. The author is upset, calling it sexist and dismissive, while her husband's family seems to support the husband's viewpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue here. The husband's statement is advising the son to disregard women's words and instead observe their actions. This is problematic because it undermines the value of women's communication and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The author is rightly concerned about setting a bad example for both their son and daughters, as the advice could lead to disrespect towards women and their opinions.\n\nThe husband's family dismissing the author's reaction as overreacting is another red flag. It suggests a potential lack of support for the author's perspective and possibly reinforces the husband's sexist behavior. The key question is whether the husband's advice is acceptable or if the author's outrage is justified.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, promoting respect and equality between genders is crucial. Teaching a son to dismiss his mother's advice and that of other women is not only disrespectful but also harmful. It can lead to the son not valuing women's input, which is the opposite of what should be taught. The author is advocating for her own voice and her children's well-being, which is entirely valid. Therefore, the husband's statement is the issue here, not the author's reaction. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
