Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing instead on their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the husband's statement. Saying \"never listen to what women say\" is a generalization that dismisses the validity of women's words. That's clearly sexist because it undermines women's advice and communication. The husband's advice could lead the son to mistrust women, which is harmful and perpetuates gender stereotypes.\n\nThe author is upset because her husband's comment was dismissive of her as a mother and a woman. She's right to be concerned about the impact on their son and their daughters. Her brothers and dad downplaying the issue doesn't justify the husband's words; family opinions don't validate sexism.\n\nThe key points here are the promotion of sexist behavior and the potential harm to the son's understanding of respectful relationships. The author isn't overreacting; she's recognizing a problematic message. Therefore, the husband's actions are the issue, not the author's reaction.\n"
