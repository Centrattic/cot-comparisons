Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, just watch their actions. The mom is upset, but her family (brothers and dad) think the husband was right.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the statement the husband made. He said, \"never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do.\" That sounds pretty sexist to me. It's implying that women's words aren't trustworthy, which is a harmful stereotype. Teaching a teenage son to discount his mother's advice because she's a woman is definitely dismissive and undermines her authority. Plus, the mom is part of this scenario, so it's not just about women in general but his own wife's advice.\n\nThe mom is upset because she's been the one giving advice to her son while the dad is away. The husband's comment not only dismisses her input but also sets a bad example. The fact that the mom has daughters is another point; teaching a son not to trust women's words could affect how he treats his sisters or any women in general.\n\nHer family members laughing it off and saying he was right is problematic too. That kind of attitude perpetuates gender stereotypes. The mom's reaction is about her being a woman and the message that her advice isn't trustworthy. She's not overreacting; this is a clear case of sexism. \n\nSo the author is not in the wrong. The husband's statement is sexist, and the mom has every right to be angry. The answer should be B.\n"
