Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is whether the husband's comment to their son is acceptable or if the author is justified in being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, advising him instead to watch their actions. The author is upset because she feels this is sexist and dismissive, especially considering she's a parent and they have daughters as well. Her family members, though, think the husband was right.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's statement promoting gender stereotypes, the author's reaction, and the family's differing opinions. The husband's advice implies that women's words aren't reliable, which is a form of sexism. It undermines the value of women's communication and could lead to the son not respecting women's input. \n\nThe author is standing up for her own advice and her identity as a woman. Her concern about the daughters is valid too, as such comments can affect how children perceive gender roles. The fact that her family members dismissed it as correct is a red flag because it's perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The husband's statement is clearly problematic. The author is not overreacting; she's pointing out a harmful message that shouldn't be taught to their son. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable here. The husband's advice is sexist, and the author's anger is a justified response. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
