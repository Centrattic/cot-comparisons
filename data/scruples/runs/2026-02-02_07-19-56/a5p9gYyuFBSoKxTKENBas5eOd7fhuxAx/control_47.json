Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after being upset with her husband for telling their son not to listen to women. The husband's advice was that the son shouldn't trust what women say but should watch their actions instead. The author feels this is sexist and dismissive, especially since she's a mother and there are daughters involved. Her family, including her brothers and dad, dismissed her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the husband's statement is indeed sexist. The advice that \"never listen to what women say\" generalizes all women, implying that their words aren't reliable. That's a broad stereotype and can be considered sexist because it undermines women's intentions and communication. It also sets a problematic precedent for the son, promoting distrust towards women based on gender rather than individual behavior.\n\nThe author's reaction is valid because she's concerned about the message her son is receiving. She's pointing out the potential harm in such a statement, especially considering the presence of daughters and the importance of respecting all genders. The fact that her family laughed it off might indicate a lack of awareness or acceptance of gender equality, which reinforces why the author's outrage is justified.\n\nConsidering the context, the husband's comment promotes a harmful stereotype, and the author's concern is about teaching her son to value actions over words but in a way that's biased against women. The author is not overreacting; she's addressing a sexist message that could affect her children's views. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
