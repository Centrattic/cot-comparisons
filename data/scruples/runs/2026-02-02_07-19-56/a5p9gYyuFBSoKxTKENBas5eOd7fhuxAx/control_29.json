Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women and instead watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially since she's been advising the son. Her family (brothers and dad) laughed it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the husband's statement. The advice \"don't listen to what women say, watch what they do\" is problematic because it generalizes all women as untrustworthy. It undermines the value of women's words and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The author's sons and daughters are being affected here. The husband's advice could lead to mistrust in female relationships, which is not healthy for the son, and it's disrespectful to the author's role as a parent and a woman. \n\nThe author is not overreacting. The statement is sexist. Her concern for her daughters is valid because the advice doesn't account for them. The fact that her family dismissed it doesn't make it right. The husband's advice is not only sexist but also dismissive of the author's input. So, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
