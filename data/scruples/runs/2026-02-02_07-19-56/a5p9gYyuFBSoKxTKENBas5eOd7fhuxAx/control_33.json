Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset at her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing instead on their actions. The author is upset because she finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering her own role as a mother and the implication for their daughters. Her family members laughed it off, but she's questioning if she overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the husband's statement. The advice given to the son is inherently problematic. Telling a teenager not to listen to women promotes a sexist viewpoint that women are not to be trusted or heeded. This undermines the value of women's advice and can contribute to a harmful gender stereotype. The husband's comment discounts the mother's input and could affect how the son treats women in general, including his sisters.\n\nThe author's reaction is about standing up against sexism. She's concerned about the message her son is receiving and the potential impact on how he views women. Her family dismissing her concerns doesn't validate the husband's statement; in fact, it's common for such comments to be normalized in some circles, which is why it's important to challenge them.\n\nIs the author overreacting? The statement is a clear instance of sexism, so her outrage is justified. She's not just being sensitive; she's addressing a harmful message. The fact that her family laughed it off doesn't mean she's wrong. It's possible they are also perpetuating the same biases without realizing it.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, she's not in the wrong for being upset. She's advocating for equality and respect, which are important values. The husband's comment is the issue here, not her reaction. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
