Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's statement to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, emphasizing watching their actions instead. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering their daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the husband's statement. Saying not to listen to women and only observe their actions is indeed a problematic generalization. It undermines the value of women's words and implies that women are not trustworthy or reliable, which is a clear sexist viewpoint. The author is justified in feeling that this advice is harmful, especially when coming from a father figure.\n\nThe husband's advice could have long-term negative effects on the son's perception of women and relationships. It promotes a mindset that dismisses women's communication, which can lead to misunderstandings and disrespect in relationships. The author's concern for her daughters is valid too; such a statement doesn't just affect the son but also sets a precedent for how the family views all women.\n\nThe husband's family (brothers and dad) laughing it off doesn't make the statement any less problematic. Just because some people in the husband's family agree with it doesn't validate the sexist content. The author's reaction stems from recognizing the harmful nature of the advice, which is a reasonable response.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Likely not. The statement in question is a clear example of gender bias. The author is standing up for her own voice and the voices of other women, which is important in raising children who respect everyone equally. Her frustration is warranted given the context and the potential impact on her children.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014she is not in the wrong. Her husband's statement is sexist, and her reaction is appropriate.\n"
