Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's advice to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women but instead watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering they have daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the husband's statement. The advice implies that women's words aren't reliable, which can be seen as sexist because it generalizes all women and undermines their verbal communication. This could teach the son to distrust women's words, which isn't healthy or fair. The author's reaction is about standing up against such a harmful message.\n\nNext, the family's reaction: the husband's side (brothers and dad) laughed it off, suggesting they don't see an issue. But that doesn't make the statement right. The author's concern is valid because the advice could affect the son's relationships and perpetuate gender stereotypes. The fact that the author is a mother and the speaker of the advice is the father adds another layer, as it dismisses the mother's input, which is hurtful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is overreacting. The key points are the sexist nature of the advice, the potential harm to the son's understanding of gender relations, and the disregard for the mother's role. The author's outrage is a reasonable response to what is indeed a problematic statement. The husband's side dismissing her reaction doesn't negate the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
