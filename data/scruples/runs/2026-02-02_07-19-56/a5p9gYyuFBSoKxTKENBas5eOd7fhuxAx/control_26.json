Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment. The husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, suggesting that women's advice isn't reliable and that he should instead observe their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering she's the mother and they have daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the husband's statement. Saying not to listen to women and to focus on their actions instead is a clear generalization that undermines women's words and intentions. That's inherently sexist because it devalues communication and trust in relationships. The fact that he's the father and making this statement to his son could have a lasting impact on how the son views women and their advice. \n\nThe author is concerned about modeling behavior for her children. If the father is teaching the son to discount women's advice, it's problematic, especially when the mother is the one giving advice. This could create a conflict in the son's perception of his mother's value and advice. Additionally, the mention of daughters makes the issue more complex because the same advice would affect how the son treats his sisters.\n\nThe author's brothers and dad dismissing her concern as overreacting might indicate a generational or cultural difference in attitudes towards gender roles. However, modern perspectives increasingly emphasize equality and respect, making the husband's comment even more out of step.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Probably not. The comment is sexist and sets a harmful precedent. The husband's advice could lead the son to distrust women's communication, which isn't healthy. The author's reaction is valid because she's concerned about her children's upbringing and the message they receive about women's roles and advice.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her husband's statement is problematic, and her concern is justified.\n"
