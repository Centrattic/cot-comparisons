Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband telling their 15-year-old son not to listen to women, focusing on their actions instead. The author is upset about this, while her family members dismiss it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the husband's statement is problematic. The husband's advice suggests that women's words aren't reliable and that their actions should be the focus. This seems sexist because it generalizes all women as untrustworthy in their communication, which undermines their perspectives and reinforces harmful stereotypes. Even if the intention was to give advice about relationships, the way it's phrased is dismissive and could be harmful, especially to a young son who is learning about interactions.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on feeling that this advice is sexist and dismissive. The fact that her family members (brothers and dad) laughed it off and agreed with the husband might indicate a generational or cultural difference in views on gender roles. However, modern perspectives increasingly emphasize respect and equality between genders, so the husband's comment could be seen as outdated or harmful.\n\nThe author isn't just upset about the comment to her, but also about the message it sends to their son and daughters. It's important to consider the impact on children, especially in shaping their views on relationships and gender dynamics. The husband's advice could lead the son to undervalue women's input and perpetuate a cycle of sexism.\n\nSo, the author's outrage seems justified. The husband's statement is sexist and potentially harmful. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
