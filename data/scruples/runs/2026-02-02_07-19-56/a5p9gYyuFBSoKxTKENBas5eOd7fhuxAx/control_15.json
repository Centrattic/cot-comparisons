Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset at her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, suggesting instead to watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, while her family members don't see an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the husband's statement. Saying not to listen to women promotes a harmful stereotype that women's words are not reliable or valid. It undermines communication and respect between genders. The husband's advice could lead the son to distrust women, which is problematic. The author is concerned about this, especially considering their daughters might also be affected. The fact that the husband's family laughed it off doesn't make it right; the content itself is the issue.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting. The statement is indeed sexist because it generalizes all women as untrustworthy based on their gender. It dismisses the value of women's advice and communication. The husband's justification by his family members (brothers and dad) might reflect outdated or harmful beliefs, but the author's reaction is valid in pointing out the issue. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The husband's comment is discriminatory, so the author has a legitimate reason to be angry. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
