Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that her husband told their son not to listen to women. So the husband said something like \"never listen to what women say, just watch what they do.\" The author is upset because this is sexist and could affect their daughters too. Her family members laughed it off, but she's wondering if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the husband's statement. Telling a son not to listen to women is definitely promoting a sexist viewpoint. It dismisses the value of women's words and implies that their actions are more trustworthy than their words, which can lead to misunderstandings and disrespect. The author's reaction is about being a woman and the impact on their daughters. She's right to be concerned because such a statement reinforces harmful stereotypes.\n\nHer family members think it's okay, but that doesn't make it right. Just because some people don't see an issue doesn't mean there isn't one. The key here is whether the husband's advice is harmful. It's promoting a belief that women can't be trusted to tell the truth, which is a classic sexist attitude. The author isn't overreacting; she's pointing out a problematic message that could affect her children's views on gender equality.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in her anger because the husband's statement is sexist and dismissive of women's perspectives. The fact that her family members don't see it as a problem doesn't negate the issue. The author is correct to be concerned about how this advice might influence her son and the treatment of their daughters.\n"
