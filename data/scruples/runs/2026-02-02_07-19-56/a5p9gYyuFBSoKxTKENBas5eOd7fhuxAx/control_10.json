Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at her husband for telling their son not to listen to women. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband told the 15-year-old son that he shouldn't listen to what women say but should instead watch their actions. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially considering her own role as a mother and the fact they have daughters. Her family members, like her brothers and dad, laughed it off and said the husband was right.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's statement, the author's reaction, and the family's response. The question is whether the author is overreacting or not. The user wants a yes or no answer (A/B) based on whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe husband's advice is problematic because it generalizes all women, implying that their words aren't reliable and that actions are more important. This kind of statement can reinforce harmful stereotypes and undermine women's communication. It's also dismissive of the mother's advice, which could create a conflict in the parenting approach.\n\nThe author is upset because she feels this is sexist and hurtful. Her perspective is valid because such statements can have negative impacts on children, especially the son learning to devalue women's words and the daughters potentially feeling their mother's advice isn't valued. The fact that her family members laughed it off might indicate a broader acceptance of such views in her family, but that doesn't make the husband's comment right.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is wrong, she's not. Her reaction is justified given the sexist nature of the comment and the potential harm it could cause. The husband's advice is problematic regardless of intent. So the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
