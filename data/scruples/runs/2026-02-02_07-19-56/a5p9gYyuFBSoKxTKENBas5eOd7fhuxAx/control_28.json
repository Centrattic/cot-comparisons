Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women and to watch their actions instead. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially because the son has been coming to her for advice. She's also concerned about how this affects their daughters. Her brothers and dad laughed it off, but she's conflicted.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is overreacting. The husband's statement generalizes all women, implying their words aren't reliable. That's a classic sign of sexism. Even if the husband's intention was to teach the son to be observant, the way he phrased it devalues women's advice. The author's concern about the impact on their daughters is valid too. \n\nThe husband's advice could lead the son to distrust women's communication, which is harmful. The fact that the author's family members dismissed her reaction doesn't mean she's wrong. It's possible they have traditional views themselves. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset; the husband's comment is problematic. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
