Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing on their actions instead. The author feels this is sexist and dismissive, especially considering they have daughters. Others in her family downplayed it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the husband's statement is indeed problematic. The comment generalizes all women, implying their advice isn't reliable. That's a classic sexist trope, reinforcing stereotypes that women aren't trustworthy or honest. It's also dismissive of the author's advice, undermining her role as a parent. The husband's advice could teach the son to distrust women's words, which is harmful and perpetuates gender bias.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting here. The statement is sexist, and she's justified in being upset. Her concern for her daughters' future is valid since such attitudes can affect how the son treats women in general. The fact that her family members laughed it off doesn't make the comment right. It's important to address such harmful statements to prevent the son from absorbing toxic views. Therefore, the author is right to be angry, and the husband's actions were inappropriate. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
