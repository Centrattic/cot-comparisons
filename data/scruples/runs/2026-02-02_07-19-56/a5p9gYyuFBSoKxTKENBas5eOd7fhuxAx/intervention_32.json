Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband told their son not to listen to women, just to watch what they do. The mother is upset, but her family (brothers and dad) are saying the husband was right. The user thinks the author (the mother) is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the husband's statement. He told the son to ignore what women say and focus on their actions. That sounds pretty sexist. The husband is essentially dismissing women's words, suggesting that women might not be reliable or truthful. That could be harmful because it undermines the value of women's advice and communication. The mother is upset because it's not just her advice that's being dismissed, but her own existence as a woman. She's also concerned about setting a bad example for their daughters.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But why would they think that? Maybe they believe the husband's advice is practical or realistic, based on his male perspective. However, promoting such a viewpoint can contribute to gender stereotypes and may affect the son's interactions with women in the future. It's also about respect and equality. The mother is right to be concerned about the sexist message, especially as a parent. The fact that her family laughed it off might be because they have traditional views, but that doesn't make the husband's statement correct or appropriate.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's advice is sexist. Dismissing women's words based on gender is inherently sexist. The mother is not overreacting; she's pointing out a harmful message. The husband could have given advice about observing actions without generalizing it to all women. The mother's concern for her daughters and the overall message of respect is valid. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong, and the author is right to be upset. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
