Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, focusing on their actions instead. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially towards her. Her family laughs it off, but she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the husband's statement is indeed problematic. The comment generalizes all women, suggesting that their words aren't reliable and that only their actions matter. That's a broad stereotype and can be seen as sexist because it undermines the validity of women's communication. It also sends a message to the son that he shouldn't trust advice from women, including his mother, which could affect how he interacts with women in general, including his sisters.\n\nThe author's daughters are also a concern here. If the husband's advice is applied to them, it could lead to a double standard where sons are taught to ignore women's words but daughters are expected to be taken seriously. This inconsistency is a valid point the author raises.\n\nThe husband's reasoning might stem from a place of trying to protect his son, perhaps based on his own experiences. However, the approach is flawed. Teaching a child to dismiss women's advice reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. It's important for children, regardless of gender, to learn to communicate respectfully and listen to all people. The husband's advice could hinder the son's ability to build healthy relationships by not valuing verbal communication from women.\n\nThe author's family dismissing her concerns is problematic. Validating harmful comments with a laugh doesn't help. The author's reaction is justified because she's protecting her daughters and challenging a sexist viewpoint. Her being the mother adds weight to the situation since her advice is being directly disrespected.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, there's no indication she's overreacting. Her anger stems from recognizing sexism and wanting to correct it. The husband's statement is the issue here, not her reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
