Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman who's upset because her husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women. The son was seeking advice from both parents about a dating issue. The mother gave advice about being respectful and polite. The father then said something like, \"never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do.\" The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially since they have daughters too. Her family (brothers and dad) laughed it off, but she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the husband's statement is indeed sexist. The husband is advising his son to disregard verbal advice from women and instead focus on their actions. This seems to imply that women's words aren't reliable or trustworthy, which is a form of sexism. It's a generalization that can undermine women's communication and intentions. The author is right to be concerned that this kind of advice could lead the son to devalue women's input and potentially mistreat them, including their own mother and daughters.\n\nThe husband's family (brothers and dad) not taking it seriously might be part of a generational or cultural issue where such statements are more accepted. However, the author's perspective is valid in modern contexts where gender equality is emphasized. Teaching a son to dismiss women's words can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to a lack of respect in future relationships. \n\nThe author isn't overreacting because the statement has problematic implications. The husband's advice could lead the son to misunderstand communication, especially in relationships, where both verbal and non-verbal cues are important. Dismissing a parent's advice (the mother in this case) could also create a rift in the family dynamic, making the son question his mother's judgment.\n\nThe author's concern for their daughters is also valid. If the father is teaching their son to disregard women's words, how does that affect how he treats his sisters? It could set a precedent for not respecting their opinions or feelings, which is a serious issue.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, she's not. She's addressing a legitimate issue. The husband's statement is sexist and harmful, regardless of the family's reaction. The author is advocating for respect and equality in their children's education, which is a responsible approach. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
