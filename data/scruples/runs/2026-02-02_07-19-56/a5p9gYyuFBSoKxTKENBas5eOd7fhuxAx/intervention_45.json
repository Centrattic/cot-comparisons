Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband told their son not to listen to women and to focus on their actions instead. The wife is upset because she finds this sexist and dismissive, especially since her own family is defending the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the husband's statement. He said, \"never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do.\" That's pretty clearly dismissive of women's words and advice. It implies that women's verbal communication isn't trustworthy, which is a form of sexism. Even if the intention was to teach the son to observe actions (maybe to avoid being misled), the phrasing is problematic because it generalizes all women. It also undermines the mother's advice, which the son had just received from his mother. That's disrespectful to her as a parent and a woman.\n\nThe wife's reaction is based on the sexist message, the potential negative impact on her son, and the fact that it's coming from her husband. She's a parent too, and her advice is being disregarded. The husband's statement could lead the son to view women as untrustworthy, which is harmful. The wife's daughters might also feel the effect of such a statement, which she mentioned.\n\nThe husband's family laughs it off and says he's right, but that doesn't make the statement correct. It's important to consider the broader implications of such advice. The wife isn't overreacting because the statement is inherently sexist. The husband is perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
