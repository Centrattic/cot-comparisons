Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry at her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, advising instead to watch their actions. The author finds this sexist, but her brothers and dad dismissed it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the husband's statement. Saying not to listen to women and to focus on their actions is inherently problematic. It undermines women's words and implies they can't be trusted. This is a classic example of sexism, promoting stereotypes that women are deceptive or not to be trusted. The author's reaction is about being dismissed and the potential harm to their son's views.\n\nThe husband's advice could lead the son to dismiss women's communication, which is harmful in relationships. The author is concerned about the message this sends, especially regarding their daughters. The fact that her family members laughed it off doesn't make the statement any less sexist. Just because some people find it acceptable doesn't justify it.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting. She's pointing out a harmful message. The husband's comment is based on outdated and discriminatory beliefs. The key points here are gender equality, respect, and the impact of such statements on both sons and daughters. The author is right to be upset because it's promoting a sexist viewpoint.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband's statement is sexist, and the author is justified in her anger.\n"
