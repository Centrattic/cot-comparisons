Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told their 15-year-old son, \"never listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do...\" and the author finds this sexist and dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the husband's statement. He's advising the son not to trust women's words but instead their actions. That sounds like a generalization that could be seen as sexist because it implies women are not truthful or their words aren't reliable. The author is upset because it's disrespectful, especially coming from her husband, and she's concerned about the impact on their son and daughters.\n\nThe husband's family (brothers and dad) laughed it off, but the author is questioning if she's overreacting. The key points here are the sexist nature of the comment, the age of the son, and the potential influence on his views. \n\nIn modern perspectives, promoting such a stereotype could be harmful. It undermines women's communication and sets a problematic precedent. The fact that the author is the one being told not to listen to women adds personal insult, as it's dismissing her advice and her identity as a woman.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. Considering the context, the husband's advice is not just about his wife but generalizing all women, which is sexist. The author's reaction is valid because she's concerned about teaching her son to distrust women's words, which can lead to harmful behaviors and attitudes. The family's dismissal of the comment might reflect outdated views, but that doesn't justify the husband's statement.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The husband's comment is problematic, and her concern is justified.\n"
