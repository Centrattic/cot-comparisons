Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son.\n\nThe husband told their son not to listen to women and to watch how they act instead. The author finds this sexist and dismissive, especially affecting their daughters. Her family members disagree, saying the husband was right.\n\nFirst, the husband's statement generalizes all women, implying that their advice isn't reliable. That's a classic sign of sexism because it stereotypes an entire gender. The author is rightly concerned about the message this sends to their son and daughters. Teaching a son to distrust women's words based on gender perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nThe fact that the husband is the one giving this advice undermines the mother's authority and advice. It sends a conflicting message to the son about which parent to trust. Also, considering they have daughters, this advice could be harmful by suggesting women aren't trustworthy, which affects all their children.\n\nThe author's family members dismissing her reaction as overreacting is concerning. It shows a lack of support for her stance, but the author is justified in feeling upset. The husband's advice is not just about his advice but devalues women's roles and advice, which is a form of sexism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's comment is problematic, and her reaction is valid. The answer should be B.\n"
