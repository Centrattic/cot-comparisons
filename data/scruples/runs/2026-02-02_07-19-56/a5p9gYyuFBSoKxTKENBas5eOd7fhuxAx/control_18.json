Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women and to focus on their actions instead. The author is upset because she finds this sexist and harmful, especially considering their daughter. Others, like her brothers and dad, think the husband was right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the husband's statement is indeed sexist. The advice implies that women's words aren't trustworthy and that their actions are more important. This can be seen as discounting women's communication and reinforcing stereotypes. It's a harmful message because it suggests women are not sincere or reliable in their words, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThe author is justified in being upset. The husband's advice could affect the son's perception of women and relationships. It's important to respect all parties' voices, regardless of gender. The fact that her family members dismiss her concern might indicate a generational or cultural bias, but that doesn't make the husband's comment acceptable.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting. She's advocating for her children to receive balanced and respectful advice. Her concern for their daughter's perception is valid. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
