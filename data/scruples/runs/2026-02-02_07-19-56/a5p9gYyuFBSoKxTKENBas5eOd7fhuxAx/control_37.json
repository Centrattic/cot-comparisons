Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when she got mad at her husband for telling their son not to listen to women. The husband's advice is pretty clearly sexist, right? He's dismissing the value of what women say, suggesting that their actions are more important than their words. The author is upset because she feels this is sexist and harmful, especially since her son is in a dating situation and needs good advice.\n\nThe husband's statement undermines the author's advice to her son. If the father is telling the son not to listen to women, that negates the mother's input, which she had already given. That's disrespectful towards her as a woman and as a parent. Also, considering they have daughters, this advice could be harmful in how the son interacts with women in general, promoting a negative stereotype.\n\nThe user's family members (brothers and dad) laughed it off, but that doesn't make it right. The author isn't overreacting; she's addressing a problematic statement. The husband's comment is promoting a sexist viewpoint, which is harmful. The author is justified in being upset because this kind of advice can lead to misunderstandings and disrespect in relationships. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
