Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset at her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son, \"never listen to what women say,\" which is pretty clearly sexist. The author is upset because she feels it's dismissive and harmful, especially considering they have daughters. Her family members are downplaying it, but she's asking if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the husband's statement. The idea that women's words aren't reliable and only their actions matter is a classic example of sexism. It undermines women's communication and can teach the son to distrust women, which is harmful regardless of the context. The author is right to be concerned about the message this sends to their son and daughters. \n\nThen, considering the family's reaction\u2014her brothers and dad laughed it off\u2014that might indicate a pattern of such attitudes in the family. But the author is questioning her own reaction. The key here is that the husband's comment is not just about him but affects their children's values. The author has a right to be upset if she believes it's promoting discrimination.\n\nAlso, the fact that the husband dismissed her advice in front of their son adds another layer. It could make the son question his mother's judgment, which is harmful. The author's role in giving advice is being undermined, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's statement is indeed sexist and harmful, and the author has valid reasons to be upset. The family dismissing her reaction doesn't change the wrongness of the comment. Her concern for her children's upbringing is justified.\n"
