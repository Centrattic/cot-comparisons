Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for being upset with her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women, to focus on their actions instead. The wife finds this sexist and dismissive, and her family laughed it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband's advice is being given to their teenage son. The comment that \"never listen to what women say\" is a generalization that dismisses women's communication, which can be seen as sexist. The wife is upset not just because of her own feelings but also considering the message this sends to their daughters. Her brothers and dad don't see it as a problem, so there's a generational or perspective difference here.\n\nIs the husband's advice harmful? It might be teaching the son to distrust women's words and focus only on their actions. That could lead to misunderstandings in relationships. The wife's concern is valid because such advice perpetuates stereotypes and undermines the importance of communication. \n\nThe wife is reacting to her husband's sexist remark, which could affect how their children view gender roles. Her being upset isn't overreacting; it's a legitimate response to something that's not just personal but societal. The fact that her father and brothers dismissed her reaction might indicate a lack of awareness about the issue, but that doesn't mean she's wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband's comment disregards the wife's advice to their son, which could be seen as undermining her authority. The wife's stance is about equality and respect for women, which are important values. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
