Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband told their son not to listen to women, just watch their actions. The author is upset about this, but her family members think the husband was right.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the husband's statement. He told the son to ignore what women say and only focus on their actions. That sounds pretty sexist. It's implying that women aren't trustworthy in their words, which is a harmful stereotype. The author is right to feel disrespected because her advice was dismissed, and she's a woman. The husband's comment undermines her as a parent and a woman.\n\nThe son is 15 and dating, so the father's advice could influence his views on relationships. Teaching a son to distrust women's words could lead to problems in how he treats women. The author is concerned about the message this sends, especially if they have daughters too. The husband's family laughing it off doesn't make it right. Just because others agree with the husband doesn't mean the author is overreacting. It's important to challenge sexist attitudes, especially in parenting.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's statement is problematic, and the author has valid reasons to be upset. The answer should be B.\n"
