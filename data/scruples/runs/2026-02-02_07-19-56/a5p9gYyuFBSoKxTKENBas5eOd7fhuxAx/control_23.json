Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about her husband's comment to their son. The husband told the son not to listen to women and instead watch their behavior.\n\nFirst, the husband's statement seems sexist because it dismisses women's words and implies they aren't reliable. The author is upset because she feels this is harmful and disrespectful, especially to the mother figure (herself) and their daughters. The husband's advice could lead the son to devalue women's input, which is problematic.\n\nThe user's friends (brothers and dad) laughed it off, but that doesn't make the comment right. The author is concerned about teaching her son to be disrespectful towards women, which is a valid issue. The husband's advice could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and affect how the son interacts with women, including his own mother and sisters.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting because promoting respect and equality is essential in parenting. The husband's comment undermines the importance of listening to women's perspectives and could harm the son's understanding of healthy relationships. Therefore, the author is justified in her anger and not in the wrong.\n"
