Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot. He was home last week when he was telling us about how he bungled things with the girl he was talking to. \n\nI told him basically to move on and reinforced the advice I\u2019d given him before about being respectful and polite.\n\nAs I left the room he asked his dad what he thought and his father said, \u201cnever listen to what women say. Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman. What about our daughters??? I feel like this was an awful thing to reach our son but my brothers and my dad all laughed it off and said he was right.\n\nAm I overreacting or is my husband actually the sexist asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe husband told their 15-year-old son not to listen to women and instead watch their actions. The author is upset because this is sexist and dismissive. The husband's advice implies that women aren't trustworthy in their words, which is clearly a problematic and sexist message. The author's sons and her father are laughing it off, but she's concerned about the message being sent, especially considering they have daughters too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the husband's statement. Telling a son to not trust women's words and only their actions promotes a harmful stereotype. This could lead the son to undervalue women's communication and decisions, which isn't healthy for his relationships or the women around him. The author is right to be upset because this kind of advice can perpetuate gender inequality.\n\nThe husband's justification from his family (brothers and dad) laughing it off doesn't make the statement correct. Just because others agree doesn't validate sexist remarks. The author has a right to object to such views, especially when it affects their children's upbringing.\n\nAlso, the fact that their son comes to the mother for advice shows that she's a positive influence. The husband's comment undermines her parenting and the advice she's given. This could create confusion for the son about whose advice to trust, which isn't fair to him or the mother.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting. She's recognizing a harmful message in her husband's words. It's important to address such issues to raise children with respectful and equal views towards all genders. The husband's statement is indeed sexist, and the author is justified in her anger.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong. The husband's statement is sexist, and her reaction is appropriate.\n"
