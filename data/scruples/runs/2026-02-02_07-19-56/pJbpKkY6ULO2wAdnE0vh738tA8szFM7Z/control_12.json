I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not starving or homeless. The situation is that they work a low-paying job, live with their aunt, and sometimes stretch their budget. They have days where they don't have much food, so they make do with leftovers and rice. They're thinking about getting help from a food bank to have more supplies, but they're unsure because they don't want to seem like they're just there for free food, especially since they're overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what food banks typically require. Usually, food banks are for people in need, not just those who are homeless or starving. Many have income guidelines or other criteria based on financial hardship. The person might meet those criteria even if they're not in immediate danger of starving. The key is whether they qualify based on income or other factors.\n\nThe person is concerned about being judged for their weight, thinking others might think they're just there for free food. But food banks don't typically judge based on appearance or eating habits. Their purpose is to help those in need, regardless of why they need help. The person is trying to manage their expenses and make ends meet, which is a legitimate reason.\n\nAlso, the idea that they're not homeless or starving might make them feel like they don't deserve help. But many people who use food banks are working but still struggling financially. The stigma around needing help can be a barrier, but the reality is that it's a resource for anyone facing food insecurity, not just those in extreme poverty.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're in a tough financial situation, trying to stretch their resources, and seeking help that's available for people in similar circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
