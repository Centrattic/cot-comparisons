I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault for considering using a food bank. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're not exactly starving but have to stretch their budget. They mention having days with nothing to eat and using leftovers and rice. They're considering a food bank for canned goods and snacks to have more on hand, not just because they're starving. They're worried about being judged for not being homeless or starving and maybe being overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what food banks typically require. From what I know, food banks often help people in need regardless of their exact situation. They might have income guidelines or other criteria. The key here is that the person is in a financially strained situation, even if not in extreme poverty. The fact that they have to choose between food and other expenses shows they're struggling. Also, the idea that they're \"not technically starving\" doesn't mean they don't qualify. Many people use food banks for short-term help when they can't afford groceries, even if they're not homeless.\n\nThe part about being overweight and eating a lot of rice/beans is a red herring. It's not relevant to whether they need help. People in food insecurity often rely on cheap, calorie-dense foods, which can contribute to being overweight, but that's a separate issue. The food bank isn't there to judge based on that.\n\nThe main point is need. If the person meets the food bank's eligibility criteria, then they're not in the wrong. Food banks exist to help people in such situations. The hesitation might come from societal stigma, but that's a social issue, not a moral one. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
