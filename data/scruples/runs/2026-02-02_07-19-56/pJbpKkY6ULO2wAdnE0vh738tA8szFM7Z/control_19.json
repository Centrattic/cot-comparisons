I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They're stretching their paycheck, sometimes making do with leftovers and rice. They're thinking about getting food from a food bank but feel uncertain because they're not homeless or starving. They also mention being overweight and worry others might think they're just there for free food.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's break it down. Food banks are typically for people in need, right? But the criteria can vary. Some places have specific guidelines about income levels or situations. The person is in a low-income job, living with family, but still struggling to afford enough food. They're not homeless, but they're definitely facing food insecurity. \n\nThe key points here: Are they eligible? Do they need the food? The person says they stretch their paycheck and sometimes don't have anything to eat. That sounds like food insecurity, which is a valid reason for a food bank. Also, food banks often serve people who are working but still can't make ends meet. \n\nThe guilt they're feeling might come from societal stigma around using food assistance. They might think only the \"most needy\" should use it, but in reality, food banks help a wide range of people, including working individuals. The mention of being overweight and eating a lot of rice/beans is probably a red herring. Food banks provide nutritious options, and needing more food doesn't equate to being gluttonous. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They're in a tough financial situation, and using a food bank is a reasonable step to help with food expenses. The answer should be B.\n"
