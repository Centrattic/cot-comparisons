I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. The author works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and stretches their budget. They have days where they don't have much food but aren't homeless or starving. They're worried about using the food bank because they might be seen as taking advantage when they're not in extreme need.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out if they're in the wrong. First, food banks are usually there to help people in need, right? But the question is whether the author qualifies. They mention they can get more food if they reduce another expense. So maybe they have some options, but those options might mean cutting into other necessary expenses. The line between being in need and not is blurry here.\n\nThe author's situation seems to be that they're struggling financially but not in dire circumstances. Food banks often have eligibility criteria, but maybe the author isn't aware. If they can't afford food without sacrificing other expenses, like utilities or rent, then they might qualify. But if they can reduce another non-essential expense to afford more food, maybe they're not in the right to take from the food bank. However, what's considered non-essential can vary. Living cheaply doesn't necessarily mean they can't use help if they're barely getting by.\n\nAlso, the author is overweight and worries about being judged. That adds a social stigma aspect. But that's more about others' perceptions, not whether they're in the wrong. The main issue is their financial situation. If the food bank is meant for people in more critical need, then the author might be using it when others more in need could benefit. But if the food bank's resources are sufficient and they accept people in various stages of financial difficulty, then it's okay.\n\nI think the key point is whether the author is genuinely struggling to afford food. If they're making do with leftovers and rice, maybe they are in genuine need. But if they can adjust their budget without significant hardship, maybe they shouldn't. However, the line is subjective. Since the author is contemplating this, maybe they feel they need the help, and unless they're deliberately misrepresenting their situation to take more than their share, they might not be in the wrong. Food banks are for people facing food insecurity, which the author seems to be experiencing, even if not in extreme poverty. So I'm leaning towards B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
