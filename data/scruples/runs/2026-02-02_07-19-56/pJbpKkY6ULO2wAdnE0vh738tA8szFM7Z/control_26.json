I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for considering using a food bank. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're struggling to stretch their paycheck. They mention not being homeless or starving but having to stretch food, using leftovers and rice. The main question is whether they're in the wrong for using the food bank even if they're not in extreme need.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the purpose of food banks. They're meant to help people who are struggling with food insecurity, which includes anyone facing difficulty in obtaining enough food. The person isn't homeless or starving, but they are in a situation where they need to creatively stretch their resources. The fact that they have to choose between food and other expenses indicates they are in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe user is worried about being judged, thinking they might be seen as taking advantage because they're not in the most desperate situation. They also mention being overweight, which adds to their self-consciousness. But food banks are designed to help people in various levels of need, not just those on the brink of starvation. The key point is that they're trying to manage their expenses and need the food to make meals more regularly.\n\nAnother angle: if they can reduce another expense to get food, that implies that other expenses are necessary or they can't easily cut them. The food bank would help alleviate that pressure. Also, the stigma around food banks is a real issue. People might feel they need to be in a dire situation to qualify, but in reality, food banks help those facing any form of food insecurity. The person's situation fits within that scope.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are in a tough spot and using a food bank is a legitimate way to get help. Plus, the food bank's mission is to assist anyone in need, not just those who are homeless or starving. The self-doubt about being overweight is a personal stigma, not a valid reason to exclude them from using the service.\n"
