There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They stretch their paycheck, sometimes have nothing to eat, so they're thinking about using a food bank to get canned food or snacks. They're worried because they can still get more food if they reduce another expense, but they live cheaply. Also, they're overweight and fear being judged as just wanting free food.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. Food banks are typically meant for people in need, right? The criteria might vary, but generally, they serve people who can't afford enough food. The key here is whether the author's situation qualifies. They say they're not starving or homeless, but they still struggle to afford food. Sometimes, people can be in financial hardship without being homeless or starving. The fact that they have to stretch their paycheck and sometimes have days with no food suggests they are in need. The author might also be overweight, but that's not a reason to exclude someone from a food bank. It's not about the quantity of food they eat, but their ability to afford it. Also, food banks often have resources for people in various situations, not just the most severe cases. So, using a food bank to help manage expenses when you can't afford enough food is reasonable. The author's concern about judgment is valid, but the eligibility isn't based on being technically starving or homeless. Therefore, the answer is likely B (no), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
