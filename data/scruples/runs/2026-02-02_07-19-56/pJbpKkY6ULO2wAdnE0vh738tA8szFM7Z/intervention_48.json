I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for considering using a food bank even though they're not technically starving or homeless. They live with their aunt, work a low-paying job, and stretch their budget. They mention days when they don't have food and have to make do with leftovers and rice.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for using a food bank. Food banks are typically for people in need, not just the homeless or starving. Many people use them because they can't afford enough food regularly. The person here is in a situation where they're struggling to afford food and are considering using a food bank to help with expenses. \n\nThe user is worried about being judged for their weight or perceived gluttony. But the core issue is whether their situation qualifies. They aren't homeless, but financial hardship can affect anyone. The key point is that they're not getting enough food without it. The stigma around food banks is a real problem, but if they truly need the help, they shouldn't feel guilty.\n\nThe user's main concern is needing more food without cutting other essential expenses. Food banks are meant to help exactly these situations. So, the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong. They're facing a difficult situation and seeking help, which is appropriate.\n"
