I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they aren't technically starving or homeless. The author works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and sometimes stretches their paycheck. They mention days with no food but use leftovers and rice. They're worried about appearing to take advantage of the food bank because they're overweight and eat a lot of rice/beans.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspect. Food banks are typically for people in need, regardless of being starving or homeless. The main criteria are usually financial hardship and need. The author is in a difficult financial situation, even if they can technically afford food if they cut other expenses. However, living paycheck to paycheck and having to reduce another expense to buy food is a sign of need.\n\nThe part about being overweight and worrying about being seen as gluttonous is a self-perception issue. The author might be internalizing stigma around food assistance. Food banks don't typically judge based on weight or eating habits. Their purpose is to provide food to those who can't afford it, regardless of how they use it.\n\nAlso, the idea that you have to be starving or homeless to qualify isn't accurate. Many people use food banks because they can't afford to buy enough food regularly, even if they have a job. The author's situation seems to meet the criteria for needing help.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're facing financial challenges and seeking help through a food bank, which is a legitimate and common practice. There's no wrongdoing in their intention to seek assistance when in need, even if they aren't in extreme poverty.\n"
