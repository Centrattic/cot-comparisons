I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they aren't starving or homeless.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the original post says. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're managing their budget by stretching their paycheck. They mention days when they don't have much to eat and use leftovers to make meals. They're considering a food bank to have more food on hand, like canned goods or snacks, but aren't sure if they're eligible since they're not technically starving or homeless. They also mention being overweight and worry that others might think they're going for free food because they overeat.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my take. I need to evaluate this objectively. \n\nFood banks typically serve people in need regardless of their exact situation. Many people use food banks not because they're starving but because they're facing financial hardships and need assistance to cover basic needs. The idea that you must be homeless or starving to qualify is a common misconception. Food banks often have criteria based on income level rather than specific emergencies like starvation. \n\nThe author's situation seems to be one of financial strain, even if they can technically afford food by cutting other expenses. They're in a position where they have to choose between different necessary expenses, which is a common reason people seek help. The stigma around needing assistance is a real issue, but the author's self-criticism about their weight and motives is their own internal struggle, not the food bank's policy. \n\nThe key point is whether the author meets the eligibility criteria of the specific food bank they're considering. If their income is within the guidelines, then they are entitled to use the service. The perception of being \"in the wrong\" might stem from societal stigma, not actual wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because seeking help from a food bank when facing financial difficulties is appropriate and necessary, regardless of not being in an extreme situation like homelessness or starvation.\n"
