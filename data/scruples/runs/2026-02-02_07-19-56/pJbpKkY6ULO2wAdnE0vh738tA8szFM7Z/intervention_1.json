I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for considering using a food bank even though they're not starving or homeless. They work a low-paying job and live with their aunt. They stretch their paycheck, make meals from leftovers, and sometimes have days where there's nothing. They want to use the food bank for canned goods and snacks, but aren't sure if they should because they don't see themselves as starving. They're also worried about being judged because they're overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for food banks. Usually, food banks help people who are food insecure, which can include those who struggle to afford enough food. The person isn't homeless or starving, but they do have days where they don't have anything. That sounds like food insecurity. The issue might be whether they meet the eligibility criteria of the specific food bank. Some food banks have income guidelines or require proof of need, but others are more flexible.\n\nThe person's concern about being judged because they're overweight is a social issue. They might feel guilty about needing help but are not in dire straits. However, food banks often serve people in various situations, not just those in extreme poverty. The idea that you have to be \"starving\" to qualify isn't accurate. Food insecurity includes situations where you have to choose between food and other essentials, which seems to be their case here.\n\nAlso, the fact that they live with their aunt and manage expenses might affect their perception. If they can reduce other expenses to get more food, but that's not feasible, they might still qualify for assistance. Food banks aim to help those in need regardless of their exact circumstances, as long as they're facing food insecurity.\n\nThe person's hesitation might stem from societal stigma rather than actual eligibility. If they meet the food bank's criteria, they're not in the wrong. If they don't, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But based on the description, they do seem to have a legitimate need, so using the food bank would be appropriate. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
