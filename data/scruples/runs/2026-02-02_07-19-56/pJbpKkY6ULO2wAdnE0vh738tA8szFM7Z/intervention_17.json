I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. They live with their aunt, have a low-paying job, and sometimes stretch their budget. They mention days where there's nothing to eat, so they use leftovers and rice. They're worried about appearing greedy because they're overweight and eat a lot of rice/beans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for using a food bank. Typically, food banks help people who are struggling to afford groceries, not necessarily those who are starving. Many accept people who are facing food insecurity, which is more about consistent access to enough food. The person is in a situation where they have to stretch their budget and have days with little food. That sounds like food insecurity.\n\nThe person is concerned about eligibility. They're not homeless or starving, but they're struggling. Food banks often serve people in various stages of need, not just emergencies. The idea that you must be starving or homeless is a misconception. Also, the person is considering using the food bank to have more staples on hand, which is practical. It's better to plan and prevent going without food rather than wait until it's an emergency.\n\nThe fear of being judged as greedy is common. Society sometimes stigmatizes people using food banks, but the reality is that food banks exist to help those in need regardless of their circumstances. The person's weight and diet shouldn't affect their eligibility. They're using rice and beans, which are economical, but that doesn't mean they're not in need. The key is whether they can't afford the necessary food for their household.\n\nThe answer would hinge on the purpose and policies of the specific food bank. If the food bank serves people in financial hardship, then the person fits the criteria. They're not abusing the system; they're seeking help to manage their expenses. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to access resources meant to alleviate food insecurity. So, the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
