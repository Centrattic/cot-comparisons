I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're not starving but struggling to make ends meet. They want to use the food bank to have more canned goods and snacks without reducing other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of food banks. Food banks are typically set up to help people who are facing food insecurity, which includes those who are struggling to afford enough food. The eligibility criteria can vary, but many food banks serve people with low income, not necessarily those who are homeless or starving. The key here is whether the person meets the food bank's criteria.\n\nThe person mentions they can get more food if they reduce another expense, but they're living cheaply. That suggests they're in a financial tight spot. Even if they aren't technically homeless or starving, if their income is low enough that they're having to stretch their budget and skip meals sometimes, they might qualify. Food banks often serve people who are working but still can't make enough to cover all their needs.\n\nThe user is concerned about being judged for their weight and being seen as taking food for selfish reasons. However, that's more about societal stigma rather than the actual eligibility. Food banks exist to combat hunger and ensure people have enough to eat. If the person is genuinely in need, even if not in extreme poverty, they're probably within their rights to use the food bank.\n\nAlso, considering the purpose of food banks is to help those in need regardless of their exact situation, as long as they meet the income guidelines or other criteria. The person isn't trying to take advantage; they're trying to manage their expenses and ensure they have enough food. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
