I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not technically starving or homeless.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're managing their expenses creatively. They mention days where they don't have food and use leftovers and rice. They're considering a food bank to have more canned food and snacks, but they're unsure if they're eligible since they're not homeless or starving. They also mention being overweight and worried about being judged.\n\nSo, the key points here are their financial situation, their living conditions, and their concerns about eligibility and perception. Food banks typically serve people in need, regardless of whether they're homeless or starving. The main criteria are usually financial need, not having enough to eat, or facing food insecurity. The person is clearly facing food insecurity, even if they can stretch their budget. They don't have to be in extreme poverty to qualify. \n\nAlso, the idea that they might be judged for being overweight suggests a societal stigma they're worried about. But food banks exist to help people in need, and there's no rule that excludes people based on weight or the reason they need food. The person's situation is a valid one. They're not misrepresenting their needs; they're being honest about their struggles. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after considering the purpose of food banks and the eligibility criteria, it seems the author is not in the wrong. They're in a difficult situation and seeking help that's available for people in similar circumstances. There's no indication of fraud or misuse here. The author is trying to make ends meet and reduce expenses, which is a common challenge many people face. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step to address their food insecurity, which is exactly what food banks are for.\n"
