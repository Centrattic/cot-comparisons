I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault for considering using a food bank. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and isn't starving but struggles to stretch their budget. They're worried about appearing to take food they don't really need.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what food banks typically require. Usually, they serve people in need, not just those who are homeless or starving. Many have income guidelines or other criteria. If the person meets those criteria, they're probably eligible. The key here is whether they're in financial hardship, even if they're not in immediate danger of starving.\n\nThe person mentions they have to cut expenses to afford more food, which suggests they're managing but with difficulty. They also mention being overweight, which might relate to their diet, but that's a personal choice and doesn't affect their eligibility for the food bank.\n\nThe main ethical question is whether using the food bank when they're not in dire straits is wrong. But food banks exist to help people in need, regardless of the severity. If they can't afford to buy enough food and meet the food bank's requirements, using it isn't wrong. It's about accessing resources that are there to support people in hardship. Plus, the food bank likely has more people in worse situations, so one person using it appropriately doesn't take away from others.\n\nAlso, the stigma around needing help is part of the problem. The person's hesitation might stem from societal judgment rather than actual wrongdoing. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
