I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering using a food bank. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're stretching their paycheck. They mention days when they don't have much to eat, but they're not homeless or starving. They're worried about whether they're eligible because they're not in extreme need and their weight might make others think they're just getting free food for personal reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of food banks. They're typically there to help people who are struggling with food insecurity, which includes not just those who are starving or homeless but anyone who can't afford enough food. The person is in a situation where they're having trouble consistently affording enough to eat, even if it's not every day. The key point is that they're in a difficult financial situation and are trying to make ends meet.\n\nThe user mentions they can adjust other expenses to get more food, but that's not always feasible. People often have to prioritize expenses, and sometimes food is the most immediate need. Food banks usually have a threshold for eligibility, like income level or household size, not just being homeless or starving. So even if they're not in the most extreme poverty, they might still qualify based on their income.\n\nAnother point is the stigma around using food banks. The person is worried about being judged for their weight or perceived greed. That's a social issue, but food banks are meant to be non-judgmental and to help anyone in need, regardless of their circumstances. The person's concern about how others might perceive them isn't a valid reason to avoid using the service if they need it.\n\nAlso, the person is looking for ways to have more food on hand, which is practical. Stocking up on canned goods and snacks can help prevent days with nothing to eat. It's about managing their resources better, which is a responsible approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person isn't in the wrong. They're in a tough financial situation, using available resources to help their family, and trying to manage their expenses as best as they can. Their concern about eligibility is more about self-perception and societal judgment rather than the actual criteria for food bank assistance. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
