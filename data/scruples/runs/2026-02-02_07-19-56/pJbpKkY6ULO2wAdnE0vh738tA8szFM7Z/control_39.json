I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they're not starving or homeless. The author mentions they work a low-paying job, live with their aunt, and sometimes stretch their food budget. They don't have anything to eat some days but use leftovers and rice. They're thinking about using a food bank for canned goods and snacks, but feel unsure because they aren't homeless or starving. They also mention being overweight and worried people might think they're just there for free food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for using a food bank. Typically, food banks help people who are struggling with food insecurity, which can include those who don't have enough to eat but aren't necessarily homeless. The key here is whether the author qualifies as someone in need of assistance. They mentioned they can get more food by cutting other expenses, but they live cheaply already. So maybe they're in a situation where they can't afford to buy food without sacrificing other necessary expenses. That sounds like food insecurity according to USDA definitions.\n\nThe author is worried about being judged for being overweight and not being homeless. But food banks usually don't have strict criteria about being homeless or starving. They're meant for anyone facing hunger, regardless of the reason. The stigma around food banks is real, but the author's situation seems valid. They need more food to avoid going without some days. The fact that they're trying to stretch their paycheck and make meals shows they're managing but still struggling. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about being seen as greedy because they're overweight is a societal issue, but their intention is to get food for survival, not excess. Food banks often provide non-perishables and staples, which can help families build a pantry. So taking food from the bank would help them manage their expenses better. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the food bank has resources and the author meets the general need (food insecurity), then they're not in the wrong. The responsibility of food banks is to help those in need, and the author's situation fits. So the answer should be B, meaning they're not in the wrong.\n"
