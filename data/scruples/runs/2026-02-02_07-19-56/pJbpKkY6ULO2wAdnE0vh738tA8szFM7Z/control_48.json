There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not technically starving or homeless. They work a low-paying job and live with their aunt. They stretch their paycheck and sometimes don't have enough to eat, so they're thinking of getting help from a food bank. They're worried about being judged for not being homeless or starving, and also about being overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the criteria for food bank eligibility. Usually, food banks are for people in need, regardless of being homeless or starving. They help those facing food insecurity, which includes situations where people can't afford enough food even if they have a job. The key is whether they meet the financial criteria or need, not the extreme conditions like homelessness. So if they're struggling to afford enough food, they're eligible.\n\nThe person mentions they have to reduce other expenses to buy more food, which indicates financial strain. They're using creative ways to stretch their meals, which shows they're trying to make do with less. Even if they're not in immediate danger of starvation, food insecurity is a valid reason. Also, being overweight isn't a factor in eligibility; it's about need. The food bank's purpose is to help people who can't afford enough food, regardless of their weight.\n\nSo, the person isn't being inconsiderate here. They're in a tough situation and seeking help that's available for people in their position. They're not taking resources away from those more in need if they qualify. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
