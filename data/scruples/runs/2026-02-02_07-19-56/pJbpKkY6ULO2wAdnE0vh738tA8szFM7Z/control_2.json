I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically homeless or starving. The author works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and sometimes stretches their food budget. They're thinking about using the food bank to have more variety, like canned goods or snacks, but aren't sure if they're eligible because they're not in extreme need.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what food banks typically require. Most food banks serve people in need, which can include those facing food insecurity, which the author seems to be experiencing. Even if they're not homeless or starving, struggling to afford enough food regularly can qualify. The author mentions days where they don't have anything to eat, which indicates some level of food insecurity.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they have to cut other expenses to afford more food, which shows that their situation is tight. The fact that they're considering using the food bank to reduce the strain on their budget by having non-perishables on hand makes sense. Food banks often provide items that can be stored and used over time, helping families manage their food costs better.\n\nRegarding the concern about being overweight, the author notes they eat a lot of rice and beans, which are inexpensive and nutritious. Using the food bank isn't about overeating but about having access to more food options without spending money. The idea that they're a \"pig\" wanting free food is a misunderstanding of their actual need\u2014they're trying to manage their limited resources.\n\nFood banks usually don't require being in extreme poverty, just financial hardship. The eligibility criteria can vary, but many accept people who are experiencing temporary difficulties. The author's situation seems to fit within that. There's no moral obligation to be in a dire situation to receive help; the purpose of food banks is to support those who need assistance, regardless of the severity as long as they meet the criteria.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help to manage their expenses and ensure they have food, which is exactly what food banks are for. The hesitation might come from feeling guilty or societal stigma, but there's no inherent wrong in using available resources when in need, even if the need isn't extreme.\n"
