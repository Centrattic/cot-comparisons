I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they aren't technically homeless or starving. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They mention stretching their paycheck, sometimes having days with nothing to eat, and considering a food bank. They're worried about being in the wrong because they aren't homeless or starving, just struggling financially. They also mention being overweight and worried about being judged as greedy.\n\nNow, food banks are typically meant for people in need, not just those who are homeless or starving. Many people use them when they face financial hardships, even if they aren't in extreme poverty. The key here is whether the person qualifies for the food bank. Most food banks have guidelines based on income or other factors, not just homelessness or starvation. If their income is low enough to qualify, they're entitled to use the services. \n\nThe person is using the food bank to supplement their expenses, which is a common reason. The stigma around food banks is real, but the purpose is to help those in need, regardless of their exact situation. Also, struggling to afford food while working is a valid reason. The mention of being overweight shouldn't be a factor in their eligibility; food banks don't judge based on eating habits or weight.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're in a difficult financial situation and seeking help to manage their expenses. The food bank is there to assist people in various stages of financial difficulty, not just those in extreme need. The person isn't violating any rules by considering using the food bank if they meet the eligibility criteria.\n"
