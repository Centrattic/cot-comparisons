I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. The situation is that they work a low-paying job, live with their aunt, and sometimes stretch their budget. They have days where they don't have much to eat but are considering a food bank for more consistent supplies. They also mention being overweight, which makes them worry about being judged for \"free food.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for food bank eligibility. Generally, food banks are there to help people in need, regardless of whether they're starving or homeless. They often serve those facing food insecurity, which includes people who can't afford enough food some of the time. The person here describes their situation as not starving but struggling to stretch their paycheck, which fits the definition of food insecurity. \n\nThe user is concerned about being judged, especially about their weight. That's a valid concern regarding societal stigma, but the food bank's purpose isn't to judge. They exist to help those in need without discrimination. The fact that they can reduce another expense to get more food shows they're managing their budget carefully, but even small assistance can make a big difference in reducing stress and ensuring they have enough to eat.\n\nThe person isn't breaking any rules by using the food bank if they meet the general need criteria. Eligibility isn't strictly limited to those who are homeless or starving. Food banks often have open eligibility policies to support anyone facing food hardship. The person's intention is to help their family's situation, not to abuse the system. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help to manage a difficult financial situation, which is exactly what food banks are for. The answer should be B.\n"
