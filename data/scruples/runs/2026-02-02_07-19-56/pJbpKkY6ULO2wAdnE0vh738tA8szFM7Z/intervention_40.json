I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, isn't homeless, and isn't starving but struggles to stretch their paycheck. They're worried about whether they should go to a food bank because they don't fit the typical image of needing it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the purpose of food banks. They're meant to help people who are struggling to afford food, regardless of whether they're technically homeless or starving. The criteria for using a food bank often include financial hardship, not just extreme poverty. The key point is that the person is facing food insecurity, which is the case here. They're not eating regularly and have to stretch their food supplies, which is a sign of financial stress.\n\nThe author mentions they can get more food but would have to reduce another expense. This shows they're in a tough spot where every dollar counts, and even small resources are critical. Food banks are set up to assist people in such situations because the need isn't just about being homeless or starving. The fact that they're considering using the food bank to have more canned food and snacks for stability is a valid reason. \n\nAnother point is the author's concern about being judged for their weight. They feel guilty maybe because of their eating habits, but that's a personal health issue and shouldn't affect their eligibility for food assistance. Food banks help people regardless of their health status. The stigma around food banks is a societal issue, but the author isn't wrong for needing help. \n\nThe question also asks if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on understanding that food banks are for people facing any level of food insecurity, not just those in extreme cases. The author isn't violating any rules by using the food bank. Their situation fits the criteria for assistance, so they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be B (No).\n"
