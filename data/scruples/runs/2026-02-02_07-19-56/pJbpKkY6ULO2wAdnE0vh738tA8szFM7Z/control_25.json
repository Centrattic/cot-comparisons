I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for considering taking food from a food bank even though they're not starving or homeless. They live with their aunt, have a low-paying job, and sometimes stretch their budget. They mention days where they don't have food, so they use leftovers and rice. They're thinking about using a food bank to have more options, but they're unsure because they don't fit the typical image of someone in need.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for using a food bank. Usually, food banks target people in need due to financial hardships, not just based on being homeless or starving. If someone is struggling to afford enough food, even if they're not in extreme poverty, they might still qualify. The key is whether they genuinely need the food to avoid going hungry.\n\nThe person says they're not starving, but they do have days where they don't have food. That sounds like a genuine need. They also mention living cheaply and having to choose between expenses. So they're making sacrifices to manage, but it's still a struggle. Their concern about being judged because they're overweight and eating a lot of rice/beans seems self-conscious. But food banks likely don't judge based on that; their goal is to help anyone in need.\n\nAnother point: food banks often serve people with various financial situations. If someone is working but still can't afford enough food, that's a valid reason. The idea that you must be homeless or starving to access help is a misconception. The system is meant to support people who are facing food insecurity, which includes situations like this.\n\nThe person's hesitation might stem from stigma or guilt. They might feel they don't deserve the help because they're working, but low wages can still lead to food insecurity. Also, the fact that they're trying to make ends meet by stretching their budget shows they're trying, but it's not enough.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the food bank's resources are available and meant to help those in need, then using it appropriately isn't wrong. The food banks have the infrastructure to handle such cases and distribute resources where needed. The person isn't taking more than they need\u2014they're just trying to get enough to eat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B (No, they're not in the wrong). They have a legitimate need, and food banks exist to help people in their situation. The guilt they're feeling is more about societal stigma than actual wrongdoing.\n"
