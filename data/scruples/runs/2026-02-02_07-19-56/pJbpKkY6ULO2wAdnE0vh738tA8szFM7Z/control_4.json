I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not technically starving or homeless. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They manage their expenses by stretching their paycheck, sometimes making meals from leftovers and rice. There are days they don't have food, so they're thinking about using a food bank to get canned goods or snacks. They're unsure if they're eligible because they're not homeless or starving. They also mention being overweight, which makes them feel like they might be judged as just wanting free food.\n\nI should consider the purpose of food banks. Food banks are there to help people who are struggling with food insecurity, which includes more than just being homeless or starving. The criteria for eligibility can vary, but generally, if someone is facing hunger and can't afford enough food, they can use a food bank. The person here is clearly facing financial strain, even if they're not in extreme poverty. They're making do with leftovers and rice, which indicates they're not getting enough variety or quantity. \n\nThe person's concern about being judged for their weight might be a personal insecurity but doesn't make their need invalid. Food banks are meant to serve those in need without judgment. The key point is whether they are experiencing food insecurity. The fact that they have to choose between food and other expenses shows that they are in a difficult situation. \n\nI don't see any indication that they're abusing the system. They want to use the food bank to have more options and not have to reduce other expenses. Their reasoning is practical and about managing limited resources. So, the answer is likely B (they are not in the wrong). However, I should check if there are specific eligibility rules in their area, but since the question doesn't specify any, the general answer applies.\n"
