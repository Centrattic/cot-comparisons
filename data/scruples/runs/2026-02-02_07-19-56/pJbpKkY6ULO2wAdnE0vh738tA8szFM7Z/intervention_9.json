I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank even though they aren't starving or homeless. The author works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they stretch their budget, sometimes not having much to eat. They're thinking about going to a food bank to have more supplies but feel unsure because they aren't in immediate need like being homeless or starving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for using food banks. From what I know, food banks are typically set up to assist people in need, regardless of their specific situation. They often serve families who are struggling financially, not just those who are homeless or starving. The purpose is to provide food to those who might otherwise go without, even if they're not in extreme distress. So if someone is working but still can't afford enough food, they might qualify. \n\nThe author mentions they can technically get more food by reducing other expenses, but they live cheaply and have to choose between expenses. This suggests they're in a tough financial spot. Food banks usually don't require you to be in absolute poverty to use their services. They help people in transitional phases or those with low income. The fact that they're trying to stretch their meals and using leftovers shows they're trying to make do, but it's still tough. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about being overweight and thinking it might look like they want free food because they overeat is a personal issue. Food banks don't judge based on that; their goal is to provide nutrition. The author isn't asking for more than they need; they just want to ensure they have enough to eat without having to cut other expenses. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're in a difficult financial situation and seeking help that's available for people in similar circumstances. The food bank's purpose is to assist people who need food, regardless of whether they're technically starving or homeless. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
