We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They're not starving, but they stretch their paycheck, sometimes running out of food. They think about using a food bank for canned goods and snacks but feel unsure because they aren't homeless or in immediate starvation. They also mention being overweight and worry others might think they're just there for free food.\n\nFood banks are typically designed to help people in need, regardless of their exact situation. The criteria for eligibility can vary, but often they consider financial hardship, not just extreme poverty. The person is clearly struggling to make ends meet, even if they're not in the most dire circumstances. \n\nThe key points here are the intent and the situation. The person isn't using the food bank for a reason they're not entitled to. They need help to manage expenses and ensure they have enough food. The concern about being judged for their weight is valid, but that's a societal issue, not a justification for denying them help. \n\nFood banks usually don't require people to be homeless or starving; they serve those who are food insecure. Since the person is facing financial constraints that affect their ability to consistently afford food, they qualify. The author's hesitation stems from societal stigma rather than actual ineligibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking assistance they genuinely need.\n"
