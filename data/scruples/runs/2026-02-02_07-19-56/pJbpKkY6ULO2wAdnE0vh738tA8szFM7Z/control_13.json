I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for considering using a food bank. They work a low-paying job and live with their aunt. They're not starving but have to stretch their budget, sometimes making do with leftovers and rice. They're worried about whether they're eligible because they're not homeless or starving, and they're concerned about their weight making it look like they're there just for free food.\n\nFirst, food banks typically help people in need regardless of their exact situation. The criteria might vary, but generally, if someone is struggling to afford food, even if not in total crisis, they're probably eligible. The key is whether they meet the food bank's guidelines, which often include things like income level or facing financial hardship.\n\nThe user mentions they live with their aunt and live cheaply. If their income is low enough, they might still qualify. Also, the idea that they're \"not technically starving\" doesn't mean they aren't in need. Food insecurity isn't just about being hungry; it's about the struggle to afford enough nutritious food regularly.\n\nThe concern about being overweight might be a personal insecurity. Food banks aren't judgmental about how people use the food; they're there to help. The user isn't in the wrong for needing help. It's common for people to use food banks to supplement their expenses when they're in a tight spot. The real issue is systemic\u2014low wages and high cost of living lead people to seek assistance. So the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
