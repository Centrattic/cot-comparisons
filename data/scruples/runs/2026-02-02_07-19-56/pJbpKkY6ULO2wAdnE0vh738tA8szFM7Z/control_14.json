I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. The situation is that they work a low-paying job, live with their aunt, and sometimes stretch their food budget. They feel guilty because they're not homeless or starving, but they do face situations where there's nothing to eat some days. They also mention being overweight and worry that others might think they're just there to get free food.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what food banks typically require. Usually, food banks have guidelines, but they're meant to help people in need, not just those in extreme poverty. They often serve people who are working but still struggling to make ends meet. The key points here are that the person is working, but the job is low-paying. They live with family, which might affect their housing stability, but they're not homeless. The fact that they sometimes go days without food suggests they're experiencing food insecurity, even if they're not in the most severe situation.\n\nThe user is worried about being judged for their weight. That's a personal issue, but food banks are supposed to provide assistance without judgment. The stigma around food banks can be a real problem, but the person's situation does seem valid. The question is whether they meet the criteria for the food bank's services. If the food bank's eligibility is based on income rather than homelessness or starvation, then the person would qualify. If the food bank is more for immediate crisis situations, maybe there's a different approach, but generally, food banks assist anyone facing food insecurity.\n\nAlso, the fact that they have to choose between food and other expenses shows financial strain. Even if they can sometimes get more food by cutting other expenses, it's a difficult choice. The idea that they're not \"starving\" might not align with the reality of their daily life, where they have to stretch meals and use leftovers creatively.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, society often supports helping those in need, regardless of the severity. The person isn't taking more than they need; they're seeking help to manage their basic needs. The guilt they feel about their weight is misplaced because food banks don't judge people for their eating habits. Their decision to use the food bank is about survival and managing a difficult financial situation, not about greed or excess.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate need, and food banks are there to help people in such situations. The stigma they're worried about isn't a valid reason to avoid seeking help when they need it.\n"
