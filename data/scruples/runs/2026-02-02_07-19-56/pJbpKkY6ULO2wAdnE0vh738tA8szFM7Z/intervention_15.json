I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for considering using a food bank. The writer mentions they have a low-paying job and live with their aunt. They're not starving or homeless but are struggling to stretch their budget. They're thinking about using a food bank to have more supplies, but they're unsure if it's appropriate since they're not technically in dire need. Also, they mention being overweight and worry that others might see it as them taking food for convenience rather than necessity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for using a food bank. Typically, food banks are there to help people in need who can't afford to buy food. The person isn't homeless or starving, but they are definitely struggling. They have to make do with leftovers and stretch their paycheck. The key here is whether their situation qualifies as needing assistance. Food banks usually don't require people to be on the brink of starvation; they help those facing food insecurity, which can include situations where people have to make tough choices between food and other essentials.\n\nThe author's concern about being overweight might be a red herring. Food insecurity is about access, not about body weight. They could be eating a lot of rice and beans because those are inexpensive options, which is common when money is tight. The idea that they're \"just a pig\" taking free food because they eat a lot is a misunderstanding of their financial constraints.\n\nAlso, the fact that they live with their aunt might make their situation less visible. People often assume that living with family means better financial support, but that's not always the case. The writer is taking responsibility by considering the food bank and thinking about their use of resources, which is a positive sign.\n\nThe main question is whether they're in the wrong. I think the answer here is no. Food banks are meant for anyone facing food insecurity, not just those in extreme poverty. The writer is in a difficult situation where they have to prioritize expenses and are seeking help to make ends meet. They're not abusing the system; they're using a resource that exists for exactly this kind of scenario. The self-doubt they express is common, but it doesn't make them at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
