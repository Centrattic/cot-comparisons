I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they stretch their paycheck. They have days where they don't have food, so they use leftovers and rice. They're thinking of using a food bank but feel maybe they shouldn't because they aren't homeless or starving. They also mention being overweight and worried that people might think they're taking food just because they eat a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what food banks are for. Typically, food banks help people who are struggling with food insecurity, which can include those who are homeless, unemployed, or have very low incomes. The person here is working but in a low-paying job. They're not homeless and live with family, which helps. However, they are still struggling to afford enough food some days. \n\nThe person is worried that they might be taking from someone in more need. But is that the case? Food banks usually serve people in various situations. If someone is struggling to feed themselves or their family, even if they're not completely destitute, they can still qualify. The criteria for food banks can vary, but many accept people who are facing financial hardship even if they have a job. \n\nAlso, the user mentions they're overweight. That's not a reason to be ashamed of needing help. People can have different dietary needs or habits, but that doesn't make them less deserving of assistance. The stigma around using food banks often comes from social perceptions, but the reality is that many people in various situations use them. \n\nThe author is considering using the food bank to have more variety or convenience, like canned goods and snacks, which makes meal planning easier. That's a practical reason, not just about avoiding starvation. But if the food bank's mission is to help those in need, even if not in extreme poverty, then this person is within their right to seek help. \n\nI think the key here is the definition of who qualifies. If the food bank requires proof of homelessness or unemployment, then maybe the author wouldn't qualify. But if they accept people with low income regardless of employment status, then they're justified. Since the question doesn't specify the food bank's policies, I have to assume that food banks generally help those facing food insecurity, which this person is experiencing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering using the food bank to alleviate their situation.\n"
