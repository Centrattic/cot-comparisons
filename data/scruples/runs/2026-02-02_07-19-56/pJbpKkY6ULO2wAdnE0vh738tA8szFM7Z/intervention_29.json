I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not starving or homeless. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're stretching their budget. They mention days when they don't have anything to eat, so they're using leftovers and rice to make meals. They think about going to a food bank to have canned goods and snacks, but they feel uncertain because they aren't technically homeless or starving. They're also concerned about being judged for their weight and eating habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules of food banks. From what I know, food banks are designed to help people in need, regardless of whether they're homeless or starving. They often serve families or individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. The key is that they're facing food insecurity. The person here is clearly experiencing some level of food insecurity because they have days with no food and have to stretch their budget. They're not using the food bank for luxury but to ensure they have enough to eat. \n\nThe person might feel guilty because they're not in the most extreme situation, but food banks are meant for a range of needs. They're there to help people who are working but still can't afford enough food. Their concern about being judged for their weight or eating habits is valid in society, but the food bank's purpose isn't to judge but to provide assistance. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's a common misconception. People might think that only the most destitute should use food banks, but in reality, anyone facing food insecurity qualifies. The author's situation fits that. So the answer would be that they're not in the wrong because they're doing what's necessary to feed themselves and their aunt, which is exactly what food banks are for.\n"
