I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not starving or homeless. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They stretch their paycheck, sometimes run out of food, and are considering a food bank to get canned goods and snacks. They feel guilty because they're not homeless or starving, and they're worried about being seen as taking advantage because they're overweight and eat a lot of rice/beans.\n\nFood banks are typically there to help people in need, regardless of whether they're in immediate crisis. The eligibility criteria vary, but many food banks accept people who are just struggling to make ends meet. The key point here is that the author is facing financial hardship and food insecurity, even if it's not extreme. They're not asking for handouts but are trying to manage their resources better.\n\nThe guilt comes from societal stigma around using assistance programs. There's a misconception that you need to be in dire straits to qualify. But in reality, many people use food banks to supplement their diets when they can't afford groceries. The author's situation of having to stretch their budget and sometimes go without food fits within the intended purpose of food banks.\n\nAlso, the mention of being overweight might make them feel like they're being selfish, but that's a personal health issue and doesn't negate their need for food assistance. Food banks don't judge based on weight or eating habits; they aim to provide nutrition for all.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a legitimate resource to help with a real financial struggle. The answer should be B.\n"
