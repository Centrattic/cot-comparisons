There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering taking food from a food bank when they're not exactly starving or homeless. They work a low-paying job and live with their aunt. They stretch their paycheck, sometimes not having much food around, and need to rely on leftovers and basic meals like rice. They're thinking about using a food bank to get more canned goods or snacks, which would help them not have to cut other expenses. They also mention being overweight and worried that others might think they're just there for free food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of food banks. Food banks are meant to help people who are struggling with food insecurity, even if they're not outright homeless or starving. The criteria can vary, but usually, they serve people who can't afford enough food. The person here is in a situation where they're trying to manage with limited resources, even if it's not extreme. They're not taking food to eat beyond their needs but to ensure they have enough. The fact that they're trying to stretch their budget and make meals shows they're trying to manage, but still in need.\n\nThe worry about being judged because of their weight or others perceiving them as greedy is a common concern. However, food banks typically don't judge based on appearance or eating habits. They focus on the need. Also, being overweight doesn't necessarily mean someone is \"pigging out\"; it could be due to various factors, including diet composition (like rice and beans being calorie-dense but not necessarily unhealthy). \n\nThe key here is whether the person is genuinely in need. They are working but in a low-paying job, which is a common situation that can lead to food insecurity. They're not asking for more than they need but seeking assistance to stabilize their food supply. Since food banks are designed for people in such situations, the person isn't in the wrong for seeking help. It's also about reducing the need to cut other essential expenses, which is part of managing poverty.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, they are not in the wrong. They're in a tough spot and using available resources responsibly to meet their needs.\n"
