I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not technically starving or homeless. They live with their aunt, have a low-paying job, and manage their expenses by stretching their paycheck. They mention days when they don't have food, so they're considering creative meals like rice and leftovers. They're worried about being judged for using the food bank because they're not homeless and they're overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the criteria for food bank usage. Most food banks have certain eligibility requirements, but they often prioritize based on need regardless of technical definitions. If they're struggling to afford food even with careful budgeting, that's a valid reason. The user isn't homeless but still faces food insecurity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the food bank's resources when they could manage by cutting other expenses, but they already live cheaply.\n\nThe user also mentions being overweight due to eating a lot of rice/beans. This might be a red herring because food banks are for nutritional needs, not weight management. However, the user is concerned about perceptions, thinking others might judge them as greedy. But the real issue is their actual need, not others' opinions.\n\nFood banks exist to help people in need, regardless of whether they're in extreme poverty. If they're struggling to afford food, even if they can cut other expenses, it's a valid use of the service. The key is whether they're facing food insecurity. The user's situation seems to fit that, especially since they have days with no food. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any policy against it. Most food banks don't require homelessness or starvation; they just need to show need. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
