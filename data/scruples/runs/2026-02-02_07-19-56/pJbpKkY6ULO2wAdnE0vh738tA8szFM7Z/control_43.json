I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they're not technically starving or homeless. They live with their aunt, have a low-paying job, and are stretching their budget. They mention days without food but use leftovers and rice. They're concerned about needing canned goods and snacks, and whether their weight (due to rice/beans) makes it look like they're just getting free food.\n\nFirst, food banks are meant to help those in need, not just the homeless or starving. Many people use them because they can't afford enough food regularly. The key point is whether they genuinely need assistance. The person here is clearly struggling to make ends meet, even if not in extreme poverty. The fact that they have to choose between expenses shows they're in a tough spot.\n\nAlso, the idea that only those who are starving or homeless qualify is a misconception. Food banks help people facing food insecurity, which includes those who can't afford enough to eat regularly. The person isn't hoarding or using the food inappropriately; they just need more stability in their food supply. Their weight is irrelevant here; eating rice and beans is a common, healthy diet for many.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They're in a difficult financial situation and seeking help that's meant for people in such circumstances. There's no indication of abuse or insincerity in their request.\n"
