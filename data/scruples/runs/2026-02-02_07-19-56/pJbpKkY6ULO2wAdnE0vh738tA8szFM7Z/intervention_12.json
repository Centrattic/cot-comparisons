I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for considering using a food bank. The key points here are their financial situation, their living arrangement, and their reasoning for wanting to use the food bank.\n\nFirst, the person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt. They mention stretching their paycheck and making meals from leftovers, but there are days when they don't have much to eat. They're thinking about going to a food bank because it would help with expenses and provide some staples like canned food or snacks. However, they're unsure if they're eligible because they're not technically starving or homeless. They also mention being overweight and worry about being judged for needing help.\n\nFood banks typically have specific eligibility criteria, but the main idea is to help those in need, regardless of whether they're in extreme poverty. The person is facing food insecurity, even if not in a dire situation. Using a food bank isn't just for those who are homeless or starving; it's for anyone struggling to afford enough food. The stigma around needing help can be a barrier, but the community aspect of food banks is to support each other in tough times. The person's situation seems valid\u2014they're working but still struggling, which is a common scenario for food bank users. The concern about being judged is a societal issue, not a personal failing. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong for seeking help when they need it.\n"
