There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference.

We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering using a food bank even though they aren't starving or homeless. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person works a low-paying job, lives with their aunt, and they're stretching their paycheck. They mention days where they don't have food and use leftovers and rice. They're thinking of using a food bank to have more supplies but feel unsure because they're not starving or homeless. They also mention being overweight, which makes them worry about appearing selfish.\n\nFood banks are typically for people in need, right? The criteria might vary, but many don't require homelessness or extreme starvation. They might just need to be facing food insecurity. The person here seems to be struggling to afford enough food, even if not in dire circumstances. They're using creative methods to stretch their budget, which suggests they're in a tough spot financially. \n\nThe concern about being judged for their weight or wanting \"free food\" is a common stigma. But food banks exist to help people in need regardless of their situation. The fact that they're not homeless doesn't mean they can't use the food bank. Plus, they're not taking more than necessary; they just want to have some canned foods and snacks to make things easier. \n\nAlso, the idea that they have to reduce another expense to get more food implies that their current budget is tight. Using a food bank could alleviate some of that pressure without compromising other necessary expenses. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the person isn't in the wrong. Food banks are for anyone facing food insecurity, and the person clearly meets that. They're not taking advantage; they're trying to manage their resources as best as they can. The stigma around needing help shouldn't make them feel guilty. The answer should be B (No).\n"
