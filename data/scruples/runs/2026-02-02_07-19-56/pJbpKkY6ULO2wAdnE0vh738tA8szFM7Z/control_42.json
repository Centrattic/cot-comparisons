I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. They work a low-paying job, live with their aunt, and sometimes struggle to stretch their paycheck. They mention days with nothing to eat, using leftovers and rice. They're worried about being judged for needing help even though they can reduce other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what food banks are for. Food banks typically help people facing hunger, regardless of whether they're homeless or starving. The main criteria are usually financial need, not someone's exact situation. Many people use food banks because they can't afford enough food, even if they have a job or a place to live. The author's situation sounds like they're in a state of food insecurity, which is a common reason for food bank use.\n\nThey also mention being overweight and eating a lot of rice/beans. That might lead to self-stigma, thinking others will judge them for their eating habits. But food banks don't require people to have a certain body type or eat specific foods. Their purpose is to provide nutrition, not to pass judgment on dietary choices.\n\nThe person is considering using the food bank to have more food on hand, which is a legitimate need. Even if they can technically get more food by cutting other expenses, that might mean sacrificing other necessities. Food banks help alleviate the stress of not having enough to eat, which is a valid reason to use their services.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're facing a real need and seeking help that's available for people in their situation. Food banks are meant for anyone experiencing food insecurity, regardless of their exact circumstances. The author's concern about judgment is valid, but the food bank's mission is to help those in need, not to judge based on perceived reasons.\n"
