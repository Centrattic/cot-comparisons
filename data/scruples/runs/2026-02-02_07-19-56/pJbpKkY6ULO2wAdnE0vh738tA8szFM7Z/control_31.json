I would not call us \"starving\", but we frequently try to creatively stretch our paycheck to try to stock up on food. There are some days where we don't have anything lying around to eat so we try to creatively use leftover meats and cook rice to make makeshift meals.\n\nI've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless. We CAN get more food if we want to, but that would mean we would have to reduce another expense (and we live pretty cheaply).\n\nIf it means anything, I'm also overweight (I eat a lot of rice/beans lol) and I'm not sure if it'll look like I'm just there at the food bank because I'm a pig and want free food.\n\nAITA if I go to a food bank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering using a food bank when they're not technically starving or homeless. The person works a low-paying job and lives with their aunt, stretching their budget. They have days where they don't have much food and are thinking about using the food bank to have canned goods and snacks on hand. They're unsure if they're eligible because they're not homeless or starving, and also concerned about being judged for their weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. Food banks typically help people in need, not just those who are starving. They serve people facing food insecurity, which can include those who have income but struggle to afford enough food. The person is in a situation where they can't always afford to buy food without cutting other expenses. That's a form of food insecurity, even if they're not homeless or starving. \n\nThen there's the aspect of being overweight and eating a lot of rice and beans. Maybe the person feels they are overeating or that using the food bank is for people who need it more. But food banks don't judge based on someone's weight or diet. Their purpose is to provide food to those who need it, regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the idea that they might be considered \"just there because they're a pig\" is a self-judgment. The person's situation is about financial constraints, not excess consumption. Food banks are for anyone struggling to meet their nutritional needs, which includes people who are under financial stress but not in extreme poverty. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They're facing a common issue where income doesn't cover all expenses, leading to food insecurity. Using a food bank is a legitimate way to get assistance in such cases. There's no requirement to be homeless or starving to use a food bank; the need is broader than that.\n"
