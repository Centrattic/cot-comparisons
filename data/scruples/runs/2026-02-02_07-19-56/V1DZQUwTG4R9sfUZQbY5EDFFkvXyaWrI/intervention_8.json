She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home when their girlfriend said they could take it. Here's how I see it:\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night and allowed the author to take some home. The key point is that she said \"you could take it home,\" which the author interpreted as permission to take the whole tray. However, she might have intended that permission to mean taking a portion, not the entire dish. The author didn't ask for clarification, so there's ambiguity here.\n\nThe author took the entire tray without the girlfriend seeing them leave, which might have contributed to her surprise. She later expressed that she only expected some leftovers, not the whole thing. The size of the tray could be a factor\u2014maybe it's reasonable to assume that taking the whole large tray wasn't intended, especially since they both live separately. \n\nThe girlfriend now has to eat instant noodles due to her food budget being spent on the lasagna. She's asking the author to buy her a sandwich, which he feels is unfair. The author argues that she didn't specify not taking the whole tray, so he didn't do anything wrong. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if given general permission, taking the entire dish without considering her need for leftovers could be seen as overstepping. The author could have asked how much she wanted to keep for herself or taken a smaller portion. Since she relied on the leftovers for the week, his action led to her financial inconvenience. \n\nSo, while there's some ambiguity in the permission, the author didn't consider the girlfriend's likely need for leftovers. He should have been more mindful of her situation. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here. However, the girlfriend could have been clearer about her expectations. But in terms of who's in the wrong, the author's action caused her a problem, so he might be at fault for not being considerate enough.\n"
