She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home after she said \"yes\" to taking some home. The key points are: the author asked if he could take it, she said yes, didn't see him take the whole tray, and now she's upset because he took all of it instead of just some.\n\nFirst, the author's defense is that he asked and was given permission. The girlfriend's argument is that she expected only some, not the entire tray. The size of the tray is mentioned, but the author thought taking the whole tray was okay because she didn't specify. \n\nHmm, so the main issue is about the interpretation of \"some\" versus the whole. The author took the permission literally, assuming he could take it home, but didn't consider that maybe she meant \"some\" of it. But she didn't explicitly say \"you can take some\" or \"leave some for me.\" She just said \"yes,\" which might not cover the entire tray. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that she spent her budget and now has to eat instant noodles. The author feels she should have been clearer. But maybe the author should have assumed that taking the whole tray might leave her with none, so maybe he should have only taken part. However, since she said yes, does that mean she agreed to the entire tray? It's ambiguous. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author got permission but maybe didn't clarify the amount. The girlfriend might have expected him to leave some. The author's mistake was not checking with her about how much to take, even though she said yes. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate and ensuring her needs were met. But she also didn't specify the amount when she gave permission. However, the fact that she's now asking for a sandwich to make up for it shows she's upset. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author should have been more thoughtful. Even if he had permission, taking the entire large tray might be seen as not considering her needs. So, perhaps the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't clarify the amount and took the entire tray, leading to her financial inconvenience. But some might argue that she should have been clearer. However, in relationship advice, often the person who is more affected is seen as the one not at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he took the whole tray despite knowing the tray was big, maybe he should have only taken part. So, A.\n"
