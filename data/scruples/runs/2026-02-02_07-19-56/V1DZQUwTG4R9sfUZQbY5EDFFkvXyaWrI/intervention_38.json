She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home when the girlfriend said they could take some. The key points here are about communication and expectations.\n\nThe author asked if they could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. However, the author took the whole tray, not just some. The girlfriend was upset because she expected leftovers for the week and now had to eat instant noodles. She also asked the author to buy her a sandwich to compensate, which is leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's defense is that the girlfriend didn't specify not taking the whole tray. But the girlfriend argues that the size of the tray made it obvious. The question is whether the author should have known that \"take some\" meant not the entire tray. \n\nIn social norms, when someone offers to take some food, it's usually understood to take a portion, not the entire prepared dish. The author might have assumed they could take the entire tray, but the girlfriend's intention was to have leftovers. Since the author didn't clarify the amount and took the whole thing despite the tray's size, they might have overstepped. The girlfriend's request for compensation is a reaction to the unexpected loss of her food budget. \n\nSo, while the author asked first, they didn't consider the context of the request and the implied understanding of taking a portion. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate of the girlfriend's original plan.\n"
