She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author took his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could. But she later got upset because he took the whole tray instead of just some. \n\nFirst, when the author asked if he could take it home and she said yes, that seems like permission. She didn't specify not to take the whole tray. So maybe he thought it was okay. But maybe she expected him to take just a portion. The key point here is communication. She might have assumed he would take some, not all, especially since she planned to have leftovers for the week.\n\nThe author's defense is that he asked and she didn't say no. But maybe she didn't realize he would take the entire tray. The size of the tray is mentioned, but he didn't consider that maybe she needed the leftovers. The author took the whole thing, leading to her having to eat instant noodles and now asking for a sandwich. \n\nHe apologized, but she still feels wronged. The question is whether he should have known not to take the whole thing. Since she didn't specify, but he did ask, maybe he's in the right. But on the other hand, he might have been negligent in not checking if taking the whole tray was okay. \n\nI think the main issue is that while he had permission, he didn't consider her intent. She intended to eat leftovers all week, so taking the whole tray was inconsiderate. He should have either taken some or asked if he could take the whole thing. Since he didn't, even though he had permission, he's at fault. So answer A.\n"
