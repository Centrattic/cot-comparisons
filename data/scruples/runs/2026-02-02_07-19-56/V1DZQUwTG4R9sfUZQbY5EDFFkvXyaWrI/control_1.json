She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said \"yes\" to taking it. \n\nFirst, the key points here: The girlfriend made a big tray of lasagna, they ate some during their date night. The author asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. He took the whole tray without her seeing him do it. Then on Monday, she texts him asking where the lasagna is. He explains he took the entire tray, and she's upset because she intended to have leftovers for the week and now has to eat instant noodles. She wants him to buy her a sandwich to compensate. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo the main question is about whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's defense is that he asked and she said yes, so he thought it was okay. The girlfriend argues that he should have understood that taking the whole tray wasn't appropriate, especially since she had planned to eat the leftovers. \n\nI need to consider the social norms here. When someone gives permission to take something, does it imply taking only a portion or the entire thing? Typically, when you're given permission to take leftovers, it's usually expected that you take some, not all. The author might have thought \"taking home\" meant bringing the leftovers he had eaten, but the girlfriend might have expected him to leave some for her to have during the week. \n\nAlso, the size of the tray is mentioned. The author's family of five ate it over two nights, which was a big tray. But the problem is that the girlfriend relied on those leftovers for the week. Even if she didn't explicitly specify not to take the whole thing, maybe there's an unspoken understanding that you don't take all the leftovers when the host is expecting to use them. \n\nThe author's argument is that the girlfriend wasn't clear, so he's not at fault. However, in many social situations, people are expected to be considerate and not take all the leftovers, especially when it's a significant part of the host's food budget. The girlfriend made a big effort and spent her budget, so expecting the other person to leave some for her makes sense. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author feels is unreasonable. The author might not be in the wrong for taking the lasagna, but perhaps he could have been more considerate by taking only part of it. The fact that he took the whole tray, even with permission, might have been a misstep. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did ask, but the girlfriend's intention was clear (to have leftovers for the week). The author might have assumed that \"taking home\" meant taking the leftovers, but the girlfriend might have expected that the author would only take a portion. There's a bit of ambiguity here, but the author's action led to the girlfriend being in a difficult situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be partially at fault for not considering the girlfriend's needs, even though she didn't explicitly say not to take the whole tray. The answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take into account her likely intention and the impact of taking all the leftovers. However, some might argue that the girlfriend should have been clearer. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the outcome, it's possible the author is at fault for not being more considerate.\n"
