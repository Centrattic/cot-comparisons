She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home even though the girlfriend said \"you could take some\" but the author took the whole tray.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend explicitly said \"you could take lasagna home,\" and the author took the whole tray. The girlfriend later complained about the size of the tray implying that \"some\" meant a portion, not the entire thing. The author argues that since she allowed him to take it home, he should be allowed to take the whole tray unless she specified otherwise.\n\nNow, considering communication. When someone says \"you can take some,\" it's often understood as taking a portion, not the whole item. However, the author took the whole tray, which might be seen as exceeding the given permission. The girlfriend's budget was affected, and she now has to eat instant noodles.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't explicitly say not to take the whole tray. But in social contexts, when someone offers to take some food, it's usually expected to take a reasonable amount, not the entire dish. The size of the tray might have been a hint, but the primary issue is the lack of clarity. The author should have perhaps asked if they could take the whole tray or a portion. Since the permission was given for \"some,\" taking the whole might be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is now asking the author to buy a sandwich, which the author finds unfair. The author's responsibility here might be to acknowledge the mistake and compensate, but the initial action was a miscommunication. The key is whether the author should have known the size implied taking only part. Given that the author didn't check with her, even though she might not have been clear, the author might still be at fault for not being considerate of the tray's size and her budget.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they took the whole tray without ensuring it was okay, even if the permission was given. The social expectation is to take only a portion unless given explicit permission for the whole. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
