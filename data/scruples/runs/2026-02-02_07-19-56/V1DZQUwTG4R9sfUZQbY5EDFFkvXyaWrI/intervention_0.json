She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home when the girlfriend agreed but probably expected just a portion.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night and said \"yes\" when the author asked to take some home. The key point here is that she didn't specify how much he could take. The author took the whole tray, not just some. The girlfriend later complained about not having leftovers for the week. \n\nEven though she gave permission, she might have assumed \"some\" meant a portion, not the entire tray. The author didn't clarify the amount, which could be seen as an oversight. However, he did ask first, so he followed her instruction. The tray was big, but the size alone might not make it clear that taking the whole thing was wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's frustration is valid because she spent her food budget, and the author could have taken only a part. The author's responsibility here could be debated. Taking the whole tray might be seen as not considering her needs, even if she said yes. But since she didn't specify, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nThe girlfriend's asking for a sandwich seems a bit much, but the author's refusal might not make him wrong. The main issue is the misunderstanding about the amount. The author might have misread her intent, but he did follow her permission. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. However, since the girlfriend didn't specify, and the author took the whole thing, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer leans towards B, but it's close.\n"
