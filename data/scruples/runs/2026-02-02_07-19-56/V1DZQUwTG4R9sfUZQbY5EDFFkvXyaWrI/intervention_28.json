She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could. The key point is that she said \"yes\" to him taking it, but he took the whole tray. Now she's upset because she had planned to have leftovers for the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication between them. The author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and she said yes. But she didn't specify that he should only take a portion. So, technically, he followed her permission. However, she later claims she expected him to take just some, not the whole thing. The problem here is that the author didn't clarify whether \"all\" or \"some\" was acceptable. Even though she said yes, maybe he should have asked for clarification on the quantity.\n\nBut wait, when someone says \"you can take it home,\" it's a bit ambiguous. In everyday situations, if someone gives permission but doesn't specify the amount, it might be up to the person taking it to use common sense. However, the tray was really big, and he took the whole thing, which left her with nothing. The author's defense is that she didn't stop him from taking the whole thing, so he thought it was okay. But maybe he should have assumed that taking the entire tray would leave her without food for the week, which is a big deal, especially for someone on a budget.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction is that she spent her food budget on the lasagna, planning to eat leftovers. The author took the entire tray, leaving her to eat instant noodles. That's a significant consequence. Even though he had permission, maybe he should have considered her needs and taken a reasonable amount. Taking the whole tray might be seen as not respecting her needs, even if she gave permission.\n\nBut then again, if someone says \"you can take it,\" and you take it, maybe it's not their fault. However, the fact that the tray was so big and he took all of it could imply that he didn't consider her situation. The girlfriend's frustration is valid because she lost her planned meals. The author could have asked if she wanted to save some for herself before taking it. Since he didn't, maybe he's in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have been clearer when he asked. She didn't specify that he shouldn't take the whole thing. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the situation is that he took the entire tray, and she's now in a tough spot. Even if he had permission, taking the whole thing without considering her needs could be seen as selfish. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed that taking the whole tray was okay, but he didn't think about her perspective. The girlfriend is upset because she's now struggling with her food budget. Even though he had permission, he should have been more considerate. Maybe the author is partly at fault because he didn't check in with her about the amount. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong.\n"
