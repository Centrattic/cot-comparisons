She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about taking a girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said it was okay.\n\nFirst, the author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend agreed. She didn't specify taking just some or the whole tray. The author took the whole tray, and later the girlfriend was upset because she expected him to take only a portion. She ended up having to eat instant noodles and now wants him to buy her a sandwich.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the author overstep by taking the entire tray even though he was given permission? The girlfriend didn't walk him out, so maybe she didn't see him take it. But she had said \"yes\" to him taking it home. The question is whether taking the whole tray was reasonable.\n\nThe author argues that since she didn't specify not taking the whole thing, he wasn't wrong. The girlfriend thinks it should have been obvious based on the tray's size. The author's family of five ate it over two nights, which suggests the tray was indeed large.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone gives you permission to take food home, it's usually expected to take a portion, not the entire dish, especially if the person intended to have leftovers. Even if the permission was given, the amount taken might be considered excessive. The girlfriend had a budget in mind and the author's action left her without enough for the week. That seems like a valid point from her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did ask for permission and was told \"yes,\" so he might not have realized he was taking too much. However, the size of the tray could be a hint. Maybe the author should have considered that the tray was intended for her to eat leftovers for the week and not take the whole thing. There's a balance between following explicit permission and implicit social cues.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole and asking for a sandwich might be a bit much, but her frustration is understandable. The key issue is whether the author should have known that taking the entire tray was unreasonable, even with permission. Since the tray was big and she planned to eat leftovers, taking all of it could be seen as not being considerate of her needs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at least partially in the wrong because he didn't account for the size of the tray and her intended use. Even with permission, taking the whole thing without considering her needs shows a lack of thoughtfulness. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
