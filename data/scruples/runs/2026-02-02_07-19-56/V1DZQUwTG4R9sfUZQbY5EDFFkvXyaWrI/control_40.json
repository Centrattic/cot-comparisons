She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the whole lasagna home when his girlfriend said he could take some. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author asked if he could take some home, and the girlfriend said yes. He then took the entire tray without her seeing him leave. The girlfriend later complained that he took the whole tray when she only expected him to take a portion. She mentioned that she had budgeted for the week and now had nothing left, leading her to eat instant noodles. She's now asking him to buy a sandwich to cover that.\n\nSo the main points here are: did the author overstep by taking the whole tray when he was only given permission to take \"some\"? The key seems to be the ambiguity in the permission. The author asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. However, he took the entire tray, which she didn't expect. The size of the tray was big, and maybe the author assumed that taking some would mean a small portion, but he took all of it. The girlfriend's argument is that it was obvious not to take the whole tray, but the author argues that since she didn't specify, he wasn't in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, when someone gives permission to take something, there's an expectation that the taker will act reasonably. Taking the entire tray when the intention was to have leftovers for the week could be seen as not acting in good faith. Even though the girlfriend didn't explicitly say not to take the whole thing, the author might have known that taking the entire tray would leave her with nothing. The fact that he took it without her seeing might contribute to his responsibility here. Also, the author's family of five consumed the entire tray over two days, which implies that he took more than necessary for a single meal.\n\nThe girlfriend's request for a sandwich as compensation is a point of contention. The author feels she's not justified, but the girlfriend is upset because she had to cut back her food budget. The author's argument is that she didn't clarify her expectations, but the situation is that he had the opportunity to take a portion and instead took all, knowing it was a big tray. \n\nIn social norms, when someone offers food, especially leftovers, it's usually expected to take a reasonable amount. Taking the entire tray without checking with the host again might be seen as inconsiderate. The author did ask, but the way he interpreted the permission might have been too broad. So even though he had explicit permission to take some, taking all might be considered overstepping.\n\nTherefore, while the girlfriend could have been clearer, the author might be in the wrong because he took the entire tray knowing the context of her budget and the size of the tray. His actions led to her having to eat instant noodles, which is a consequence he might be responsible for.\n"
