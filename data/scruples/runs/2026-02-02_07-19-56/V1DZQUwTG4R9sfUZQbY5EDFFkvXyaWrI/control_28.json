She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend made lasagna for their date night, and after they ate, the author asked if he could take some home for his family. The girlfriend said yes, and he took the whole tray. Later, the girlfriend was upset because she thought he'd only take some, not the whole thing, leaving her with no leftovers for the week.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. He didn't specify how much, so he took the whole tray. However, the girlfriend intended to have leftovers for the rest of the week. She didn't clarify the quantity, but maybe she assumed he would take a reasonable amount. The author argues that since she didn't say \"don't take the whole thing,\" he was within his rights. But the girlfriend felt it was obvious that he shouldn't take all of it because the tray was big.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether he should have known that taking the whole tray was not appropriate. Even though he got permission, maybe he should have asked how much to take, especially since it's a big tray. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend should have been more specific. The author did take the whole dish, which might be seen as not considering her needs beyond the dinner. The girlfriend ended up having to eat instant noodles to save her budget, which shows the impact of his action. The author feels she's at fault for not being clear, but perhaps he could have been more considerate and maybe taken only part of it even after she said yes. The fact that his family of five ate it over two nights shows that it was a large amount, which might not have been necessary. So maybe the author should have realized that taking the whole tray was excessive and left his girlfriend without food for the week. Even if she didn't specify, the size of the tray could have been a clue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more considerate and for not checking the quantity.\n"
