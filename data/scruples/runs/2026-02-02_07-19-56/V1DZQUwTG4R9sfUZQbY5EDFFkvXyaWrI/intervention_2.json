She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author went to his girlfriend's place for a date night, and she made a big homemade lasagna. After eating, he asked if he could take the lasagna home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, not realizing she meant just some of it. When she found out, she was upset because she had planned to eat the leftovers for the week, and now she's stuck with instant noodles. The author apologized but argued that since she didn't specify not to take the whole tray, he thought it was okay. She felt he should have known not to take it all because the tray was big. Now she's asking him to buy her a sandwich, and he's upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. So, he got permission. But maybe the problem is that the girlfriend's \"yes\" was implied to take some, not all. However, the author took the entire tray. The question is whether he misunderstood the permission, or if he should have known better.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she made the lasagna for both of them to eat. Maybe she expected leftovers for the week. When she said yes to him taking it, she probably meant just a portion, not the whole thing. The author, living with his parents, might not have realized that his girlfriend needed the leftovers. But he did ask, and she didn't specify. So, was he supposed to take only a part? But how would he know? She didn't clarify. The tray was big, but size alone might not indicate that he shouldn't take it all.\n\nHowever, the author took the whole tray, which left his girlfriend without food for the week. That seems considerate on his part. Wait, but he did ask, so maybe he was in the right. But maybe he should have realized that taking the entire tray was unreasonable. Maybe he was too literal. The girlfriend spent her entire food budget on this, so she had a plan. The author, by taking all, disrupted that plan.\n\nBut the author's argument is that he asked and was given permission. The girlfriend's complaint is that he should have known not to take it all. So, it's a bit of a gray area. In terms of social norms, when someone makes food for a date night, it's common to assume there's leftovers for both. Taking the entire leftovers might be seen as taking advantage, even if permission was given. The girlfriend might feel that the permission was for a small amount, not the whole thing. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her need for leftovers, even though she didn't explicitly say not to take the whole tray. Socially, maybe he should have been more considerate. On the other hand, she didn't specify, so it's a misunderstanding. But the fact that she had to eat instant noodles shows she's in a tight situation. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't think about her circumstances and took the entire thing, which left her without food. Even though he asked, the act of taking all might be seen as not thinking about her needs. So, maybe he is at fault. But I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the permission was clear enough. If she said yes, then maybe he's not at fault. But if she expected him to take only a portion, then he is. This is a common issue in relationships where assumptions are made. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her situation and took all, even though she didn't specify. So, answer A.\n"
