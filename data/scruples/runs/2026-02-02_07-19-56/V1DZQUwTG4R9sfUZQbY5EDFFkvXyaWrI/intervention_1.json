She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for taking their girlfriend's entire lasagna home even though she said they could take some. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night and allowed him to take it home. The man took the whole tray, not just some. The size of the tray was big, and his family of five ate it over two days. She then felt that taking the whole tray was taking more than she intended, especially since she had planned to eat leftovers for the week. She's now asking him to buy a sandwich and is upset.\n\nSo, did he overstep? The woman explicitly said \"you could take lasagna home,\" but didn't specify the quantity. The man interpreted \"take it home\" as taking the whole tray. However, common courtesy might suggest that \"some\" is a small portion, not the entire dish. The fact that the tray was big could imply that she expected leftovers, so taking the whole thing might not be clear. But the social norm is that when someone offers to take leftovers, it's usually a smaller amount. Taking the entire tray might not be obvious as acceptable, even if she didn't specify. \n\nAlso, the woman is now in a situation where she can't afford to buy more food because she spent her budget on making the lasagna. The man's family ate it, and he's not willing to compensate her, which she feels he should. The man argues that she should have been clearer. But maybe he should have asked how much she wanted him to take, or taken a reasonable amount. Since he took the whole tray and now she's struggling, even if she didn't say \"only take some,\" he might have misread the social cues. \n\nThe answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because even though she gave permission, not clarifying the quantity doesn't absolve him from taking the entire dish, especially when it's clear she needed leftovers. He should have considered her financial situation and the purpose of the leftovers. The size being big might be a red flag that the whole tray isn't intended for him to take. So, he's at fault for not being more considerate and for assuming he could take the whole thing.\n"
