She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about taking the girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take some. The author took the whole tray, not just some, and now the girlfriend is upset because she had planned to eat leftovers for the week.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and expectations. The girlfriend said \"you could take it home,\" which the author interpreted as permission to take the whole tray. But the girlfriend expected only a portion. The problem is that the author didn't clarify the quantity. Even though the permission was given, maybe the author should have considered the size of the tray and asked if it was okay to take all of it. The girlfriend mentioned the tray was really big, so maybe the author should have realized that taking the entire tray might not be appropriate. However, the author did ask and was given permission, so there's ambiguity here.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have been more specific about how much he could take. But since the author took the whole tray, even though it was allowed, it ended up causing her financial issues. The author's defense is that the permission was given and the size wasn't a clear indicator. But the girlfriend's argument is that the size made it obvious. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author didn't consider the girlfriend's possible needs. Even if he was allowed to take it, taking the entire tray without checking if she needed leftovers for herself was thoughtless. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account that the girlfriend might have intended to eat the leftovers. Additionally, the girlfriend is asking for help now, which the author feels is unreasonable, but the fact that he took all of it led to her having to eat instant noodles. So maybe the author should have been more considerate and taken only part of it, even with permission.\n"
