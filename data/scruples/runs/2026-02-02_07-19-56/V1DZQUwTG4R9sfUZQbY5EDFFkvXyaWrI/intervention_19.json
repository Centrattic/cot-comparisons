She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking the girlfriend's entire lasagna home after she said he could take some. \n\nFirst, the setup: They're both college students. The girlfriend made a big lasagna tray from scratch. The author asked if he could take it home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, not just some, and she didn't see him take it because she didn't walk him out.\n\nThen on Monday, she texts him asking where the lasagna is. He explains he took the whole thing. She's upset because she intended to have leftovers for the week and now is stuck with instant noodles. The author apologizes but argues that she didn't specify not to take the whole tray, so he thought it was okay. The girlfriend says the size of the tray should have made it obvious not to take all of it. The author's family of five ate it over two days, so it was indeed a large amount.\n\nThe author feels it's her fault for not being clear, and he doesn't think she's justified in asking him to buy her a sandwich. She called him an asshole, and he's wondering if he's the AITA.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if he could take it, and she said yes. But he took the whole tray. The question is whether \"take it home\" implies taking the whole tray or just some of it. Typically, when someone offers to take leftovers, it's understood that you take some, not the entire portion. However, the author interpreted \"yes\" as permission to take the whole tray. But maybe he should have clarified how much he wanted to take. The girlfriend didn't specify because she assumed he meant \"some,\" but since the tray was big, maybe he should have realized that taking the whole thing would leave her with nothing. \n\nThe girlfriend's food budget was spent on this, and now she's in a tough spot. The author could have taken a portion, left the rest, and offered to help if she needed. By taking the whole thing, even after permission, he didn't consider her financial situation. The fact that he's being asked to buy a sandwich shows that she's seeking some compensation, which might be reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author had the chance to clarify but didn't. He might have overstepped by taking the entire tray. Even though she didn't specify, the size of the tray and the purpose (leftovers for the week) should have been a clue. His family eating it over two days suggests it was a large amount, so he should have been more considerate. The argument that \"she didn't tell me\" is a bit weak because he had the opportunity to ask for clarification, especially given the tray's size. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he took the entire tray without considering her needs and the financial impact on her. He should have only taken a portion, even if he was given general permission. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps harsh (calling him an asshole), is understandable given the situation. The author could have been more thoughtful and proactive in helping her out after realizing the mistake.\n"
