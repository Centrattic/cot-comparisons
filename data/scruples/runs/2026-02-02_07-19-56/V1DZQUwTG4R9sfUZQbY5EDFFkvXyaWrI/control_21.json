She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home. The author asked if he could take it, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, but she later complained because she needed the leftovers for the rest of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author misunderstood her permission. She allowed him to take some, but maybe not the entire tray. The key point is that when he asked, she didn't specify how much. He assumed the whole tray was okay, but she expected only a portion. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about her food budget and having to eat instant noodles. The author argues that since she said yes, he wasn't supposed to take the whole thing. But common sense says that when someone offers to take some leftovers, they usually expect you to take a part, not the entire batch. \n\nAlso, the size of the tray was a big one, which might have been a clue. But the author didn't consider that. Even if she didn't explicitly say \"take some,\" the context of a date night and wanting leftovers suggests she intended to keep some for herself. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he took the whole tray despite knowing it was a big tray. Even if he asked, he should have been more considerate of her needs. The girlfriend is upset because her budget was affected, and she's asking for help, which the author is reluctant to give. \n\nBut then, the author did ask and was given permission. So maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, in social situations, people often interpret \"take some\" as not the whole thing. The line between \"some\" and \"all\" is blurry, but taking the entire tray might have been unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is A, meaning the author is in the wrong. Because even though he asked, he didn't consider that \"some\" would be the norm, and the size of the tray should have made him think twice. The girlfriend's financial stress is a valid reason for her frustration.\n"
