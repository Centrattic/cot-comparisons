She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author took their girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take some. The girlfriend ended up upset because the author took the whole tray, not just some, and now she's having to eat instant noodles and wants the author to buy her a sandwich. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if they could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. The author didn't specify how much they would take, just assumed they could take the whole tray. The girlfriend thought \"some\" would be appropriate, but the author took the entire tray. \n\nThe problem here is that while the girlfriend gave permission to take some, she might have expected the author to take a portion, not the whole thing. The author might have thought that since the tray was big, they could take it all, but the girlfriend's budget was tied to having leftovers for the week. \n\nSo, even though the girlfriend didn't explicitly say not to take the whole tray, the author's interpretation of \"yes\" might not account for the girlfriend's intention. The author could have possibly asked how much was okay to take, or checked if taking the whole tray was acceptable. Instead, they took the entire tray without clarification, leading to the girlfriend's financial strain. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she had planned on leftovers. The author's argument that the size of the tray doesn't make it obvious might be a bit of a stretch. In many social contexts, taking the whole tray without checking could be seen as overstepping, especially when the host is using it for leftovers. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective and took more than a reasonable portion without clarifying. The girlfriend's request for a sandwich could be seen as a way to mitigate her loss, but the author's refusal to help might come off as insensitive.\n"
