She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their girlfriend's entire lasagna home when she just said they could take some. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend made lasagna for them, and after dinner, the author asked if they could take some home. She said yes. The author took the whole tray, thinking she was okay with that. The next day, the girlfriend was upset because she wanted leftovers for the week and he took all of it. She's now asking him to buy her a sandwich, and he's arguing that he didn't think taking the whole tray was wrong since she didn't specify.\n\nSo, the main issue is about clarity and expectations. The author asked if he could take it home, and the girlfriend said yes. But she might have assumed he would take just a portion. The question is whether the author should have known not to take the whole tray. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he got permission to take it home, and he interpreted that as taking the whole tray. But the girlfriend expected leftovers and was left without food for the week. The size of the tray was big, which the author mentions, but he also notes that his family of five ate it over two nights. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone offers food, especially homemade, it's common to take a reasonable amount unless specified otherwise. However, taking the entire tray without checking if that's okay might be seen as overstepping, even if permission was given. The author might be in the wrong because even though he had permission, he didn't consider the context of her needing leftovers. The girlfriend's food budget was spent on the lasagna, so she had a legitimate reason to be upset. \n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't say he couldn't take the whole thing. But in many relationships, understanding each other's needs and intentions is part of communication. The girlfriend might have expected him to consider that she made it for leftovers. So, maybe the author should have taken only a part, even with permission. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did say \"yes\" to taking it home, so maybe she didn't specify because she thought he would take some, not all. The author might not be in the wrong if he took her permission at face value. However, the result is that she had to eat instant noodles because of him. That's a significant inconvenience. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author had permission, he should have been more considerate of her need for leftovers. Taking the whole tray without checking if that's acceptable, even after she said yes, could be seen as not being attentive to her situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her needs despite getting permission.\n"
