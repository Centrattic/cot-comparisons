She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the whole lasagna when his girlfriend said he could take some. First, when he asked if he could take it home, she said yes. He didn't realize she meant just some, not the whole tray. He took the whole thing because he thought she allowed it. The problem is that he took the entire tray, leaving her with nothing.\n\nHmm, so she made the lasagna with the intention of having leftovers for the week. The author took all of it, not understanding that she needed leftovers. The key point here is whether the author should have known that taking the whole tray wasn't appropriate. The girlfriend claims that the size of the tray should have been a hint, but the author might not see it that way. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The author asked if he could take it, and she said yes. She didn't clarify that he should only take some. However, taking the whole tray might have been excessive, especially considering she needed leftovers. Even though she didn't specify, maybe the author should have considered that she might need some for herself. \n\nBut also, when someone says \"you can take it home,\" does that mean the whole thing? It could be interpreted either way. The author took it literally, but the girlfriend expected a portion. So maybe the responsibility is shared. However, the author did take the entire tray, which caused her financial strain. \n\nIn terms of fairness, even if she didn't specify, taking all of it without considering her needs could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have overstepped, even if he had permission. The fact that she's now asking for a sandwich to be reimbursed is another point. The author might not be wrong entirely, but there's a part where he should have been more thoughtful about how much he took.\n"
