She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking the whole lasagna when he was told he could take some.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend made homemade lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take some home for his family, and she said yes. He took the entire tray without her seeing him leave, and later she was upset because she had planned to eat leftovers for the week. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe author says he asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. He interpreted that as permission to take the whole tray. She, on the other hand, thought he would only take some. The debate here is about whether the author should have realized that taking the entire tray was unreasonable, even though she didn't explicitly say not to. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he followed her permission and didn't take anything without asking. He might argue that since she didn't specify the amount, he had the right to take what he asked for. On the other hand, she might feel that taking the entire tray was excessive, especially since it was a large tray and she had planned to use the leftovers. \n\nBut does not specifying the amount mean he can take all of it? Generally, when someone says you can take some, it's implied that you shouldn't take all. The phrase \"some\" usually means a portion, not the entire thing. The author might have assumed he could take a portion, but taking the whole tray left her with nothing. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is understandable. She spent her food budget on the lasagna, and now she's stuck with no leftovers and has to eat cheap instant noodles. She's asking for a sandwich to compensate, which the author feels is unreasonable. However, the author's actions did cause her financial inconvenience, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Since he asked for permission and was given a yes, but didn't consider the implications of taking all, there's a middle ground. However, in social contexts, taking the entire tray without considering the host's needs might be seen as overstepping, even if permission was given. The key is whether the author should have known that taking the whole tray wasn't appropriate. \n\nSo, considering that the author took the whole tray despite knowing it was a big tray and the girlfriend's intention to have leftovers, he might be seen as not being considerate enough. The answer could lean towards AITA being on the author's side because he didn't take into account her needs beyond just getting permission. Even though she didn't explicitly say not to take the whole thing, the social norm is to only take some, not all. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
