She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took their girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take some. The girlfriend later got upset because he took the whole tray, not just some, and she ended up having to eat instant noodles because she had planned on eating leftovers for the week.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and expectations. When the author asked if he could take the lasagna home, the girlfriend said yes. However, she didn't specify that he should only take a portion. The author took the whole tray, which led to her not having enough food for the week. \n\nThe author's defense is that she never told him he couldn't take the whole tray. The girlfriend's argument is that it was obvious that taking the entire tray wasn't appropriate because the tray was big and she intended to have leftovers. \n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone offers you food to take home, it's generally understood that \"some\" would mean a reasonable portion, not the entire thing, especially if the host plans to eat leftovers themselves. The size of the tray might be a clue that taking the whole thing would leave her with nothing. Even though the author was explicitly allowed to take some, the quantity might imply that taking the entire dish wasn't the right thing to do. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of being upset and asking for compensation (a sandwich) could be seen as reasonable because she had financial plans based on the leftovers. The author might have overstepped by taking the entire tray, even if he had permission. It's about implicit understanding\u2014she probably expected him to take a portion, not the whole thing. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he should have considered her intentions and the practical implications of taking the whole lasagna. Even with permission, taking the entire tray left her without food, which was not considerate. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps a bit harsh (calling him an asshole), stems from a valid concern about her food budget.\n"
