She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said it was okay.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author asked if he could take the lasagna home and she said yes. He took the whole tray because she didn't specify he could only take some. Now she's upset because she intended to have leftovers for the week and ended up with nothing but instant noodles.\n\nThe author argues that since she explicitly allowed him to take it home, he wasn't at fault. She claims he should have realized not to take the entire tray, especially since it was big. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a communication standpoint, the author asked and received permission. The girlfriend didn't set any boundaries, like specifying he could only take a portion. She might have expected him to take some but leave some for her, but she didn't clarify. The author followed her permission as given. \n\nHowever, there's a social expectation that when someone shares food, especially in a relationship, you consider the other person's needs. But the author didn't know she needed it for the week unless she specified. She might be responsible for not clarifying her intention. \n\nOn the other hand, the author took the whole tray, which was large, and that might have been a bit greedy, even if he had permission. But since she agreed, maybe he's in the right. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole and asking for a sandwich could be seen as overreacting, but maybe she's stressed about her food budget. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's action was wrong despite the permission. Since he got permission and she didn't specify any constraints, the fault might lie with her for not being clear. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
