She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home after she said they could take some. The author took the whole tray, not just some. The girlfriend is upset because she had planned to eat leftovers for the week and now has to eat instant noodles. She's asking the author to buy her a sandwich, and they're arguing about who's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author asked if they could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. The author might think that permission included taking the whole tray. However, the girlfriend intended for them to take some, not the entire thing. The tray was big, and maybe the author should have realized that taking the whole thing was unreasonable. \n\nBut the girlfriend didn't specify the amount. She just said \"yes\" to taking it home. The author might not have been aware that she expected only a portion. The girlfriend's complaint is about the size of the tray leading to her financial problem. The author's defense is that the size wasn't a clear indicator. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone makes food for a shared meal, leftovers are often meant to be shared or saved. Taking the entire leftovers might be seen as taking more than one's share. However, since the permission was given, the author might not be entirely at fault. But the girlfriend's expectation wasn't clearly communicated. \n\nThe author did apologize and the girlfriend still holds them responsible. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that taking the whole tray was excessive, even with permission. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't set clear boundaries. But in relationships, sometimes assumptions can lead to issues. The author's responsibility is a bit there because they should have maybe asked how much to take or taken only a portion. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably yes. They took the whole tray despite the girlfriend's possible expectations. Even though permission was given, taking the entire leftovers can be seen as overstepping. The correct answer would be A (Yes).\n"
