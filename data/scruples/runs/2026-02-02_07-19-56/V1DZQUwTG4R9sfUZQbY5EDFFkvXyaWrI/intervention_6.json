She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by breaking down the situation. The author asked his girlfriend if he could take the lasagna home, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, not realizing she expected just some leftovers. Now she's upset because she had planned to eat the leftovers for the rest of the week and had to spend her food budget on something else. She wants him to buy a sandwich, and he's arguing that since she didn't specify the amount, he's not at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author took the right approach. He asked permission, which is good, but maybe he should have clarified how much he wanted. However, she said yes without specifying, so he might have assumed he could take the whole tray. But the size of the tray was big, and maybe he should have considered that she might need leftovers. But the author did ask, and she didn't mention the quantity. So maybe she's also at fault for not being clear.\n\nOn the other hand, taking an entire meal that someone else intended to have leftovers from could be seen as taking too much, even if permission was given. The key point here is whether the author overstepped even after being given permission. Since he asked and she agreed, technically he's not in the wrong, but maybe socially or morally he should have left some for her. She's now asking for compensation, which complicates it. The author refuses, thinking it's her fault. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the permission was explicit enough. Since she didn't specify the amount, and he asked, it's a bit tricky. But maybe the author should have considered her situation more. However, legally or in terms of the initial agreement, he didn't do anything wrong. But socially, he might have overstepped. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he asked and was granted permission, technically B (No) might be the answer. But some might argue A because he took the whole tray without considering her needs. Hmm. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
