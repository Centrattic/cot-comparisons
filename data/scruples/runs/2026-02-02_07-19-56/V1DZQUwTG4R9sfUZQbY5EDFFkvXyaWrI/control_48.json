She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who took the lasagna is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy and his girlfriend are in a relationship. They had a date night where she made homemade lasagna. He asked if he could take some home, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, not realizing she wanted him to just take a portion. Now she's upset because she spent her food budget on it and now has nothing left for the week. She wants him to buy her a sandwich as compensation. He feels like she should have been clearer that he shouldn't take the whole thing.\n\nSo the key points here. The guy asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. He didn't know that by \"take it home\" she meant just some of it. She argues that the tray was big, so he should have known not to take the whole thing. But he points out that she didn't specify that he couldn't take the whole tray. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, when someone says \"you can take it home,\" it's reasonable to interpret that as taking the entire dish unless specified otherwise. However, maybe the girlfriend expected him to take just a portion, not the whole tray. But in her initial response, she didn't mention that only a part should be taken. So maybe the guy isn't at fault because he followed her permission as given. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in a relationship that the person would consider the other's needs. If he knew the tray was big and that she intended to eat leftovers for the week, perhaps he should have taken only a portion. But he didn't know that part. She didn't mention that she needed the leftovers. So he might not be in the wrong because he didn't have that information. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The argument here is that since he asked and she said yes, he didn't overstep. However, maybe there's an expectation of good faith. But in this case, the author did ask, and she didn't set boundaries. So he's not at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
