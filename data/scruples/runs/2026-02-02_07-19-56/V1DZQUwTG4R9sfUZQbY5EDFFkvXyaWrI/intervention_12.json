She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person posting the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking the girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said \"yes\" to taking it. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made a big tray of lasagna. The author asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. He took the entire tray. She didn't walk him out, so she didn't see him take it. The next day, she's upset because he took the whole thing, not just some.\n\nThe author argues that since he asked and she said yes, taking the whole tray was okay. The girlfriend's argument is that the size of the tray should have been obvious that he shouldn't take all of it. But the author points out that he was just told he could take it home, and the size alone doesn't necessarily imply that part should be left.\n\nNow, considering the social norms here. When someone says \"you can take it home,\" the default assumption is that you can take some, but maybe not all. But in this case, the girlfriend didn't specify. The author might have assumed that taking the whole tray was acceptable because he was given permission. However, she had intended leftovers for the week, which he ended up taking all. \n\nThe author might have overstepped by taking the entire tray, even with permission. The girlfriend's frustration is valid because her needs were not met. Even though she didn't specify, the amount she made was for her own use. The author could have asked for clarification, like how much to take. Since he didn't, it's his fault for not being more considerate. Also, the fact that she ended up eating instant noodles shows that his action had a real impact on her, which he should have considered.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he should have been more thoughtful about how much to take, even with permission. The size of the tray being big is a clue, but he's responsible for ensuring he didn't take more than intended. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
