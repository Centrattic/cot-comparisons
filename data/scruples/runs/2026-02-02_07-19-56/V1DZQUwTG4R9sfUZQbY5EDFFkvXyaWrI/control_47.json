She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna even though the girlfriend said he could take it home.\n\nFirst, the girl made the lasagna for their date night. She said \"yes\" when he asked if he could take some home. But he took the whole tray, not just some. The key point here is whether the girl's permission was for the whole tray or just a portion. The author asked if he could take it home, and she didn't specify that he should only take part of it. So technically, he followed her permission literally. But he might have misinterpreted her intent. She probably expected him to take some, not the entire dish. \n\nThe girl's argument is that the tray was big, implying he should have realized not to take all. But the author's defense is that he asked and she didn't say no. So, there's a misunderstanding here. The author might not be in the wrong because he got explicit permission. However, maybe he should have considered the context\u2014knowing she made the lasagna for the two of them and that leftovers were meant for her. Taking the whole tray left her with nothing, which seems thoughtless. Even though he had permission, maybe he should have only taken a portion. But since she didn't clarify, the onus might be on her to specify. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's reaction is that she's now struggling with her food budget, which is a valid problem caused by his action. But he did apologize. She wants him to buy a sandwich, which he feels is unreasonable. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf he literally followed her permission but in a way that wasn't considerate, he might still be in the wrong because he didn't consider her needs. However, if he strictly followed what she said, then maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. But generally, in such situations, people expect that taking the whole leftovers might not be considerate even if permission is given. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not considering the practical implications, even if he had permission. So the answer might be A.\n"
