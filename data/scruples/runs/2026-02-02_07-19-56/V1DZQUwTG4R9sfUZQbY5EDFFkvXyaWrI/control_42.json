She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home even though his girlfriend said he could take it. The key points here are consent, clear communication, and expectations.\n\nSo, the girlfriend made the lasagna, gave permission for him to take some home, and he took the whole tray. She later complained because she expected leftovers. The author argues that since she said \"yes\" without specifying the amount, he took it all. But she thought \"some\" was implied, not the whole thing. \n\nHmm, when someone gives permission to take something, the default assumption might be that they can take a portion, not the entire item. However, the author explicitly asked and got approval. But maybe he should have clarified the quantity. Did he assume she meant the whole thing, while she meant just some? The tray was big, but that doesn't make the expectation clear. If she wanted to keep leftovers, maybe she should have mentioned that. \n\nBut on the other hand, taking the whole tray might have been a bit greedy. Even if she said yes, not specifying the amount could lead to misunderstandings. The author could have asked how much he should take. However, since she didn't specify, maybe he isn't entirely at fault. \n\nThe girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author feels is unfair. The question is whether he overstepped by taking the entire tray. The answer hinges on whether the author should have known that \"taking it home\" implied taking only part, not the whole. \n\nIn many cases, when someone offers to take food home, it's common to take some, not all. So maybe the author should have taken that into account. But technically, he got permission. However, the consequence was her having to eat instant noodles. The author might be expected to share the lasagna once he realized her issue. But since he didn't take her concerns seriously when she asked for a sandwich, maybe he's being a bit inconsiderate now. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author got permission but didn't clarify the amount, leading to a misunderstanding. The girlfriend didn't specify that she needed leftovers. However, the author's action of taking the entire tray caused her financial hardship. The author might share some responsibility for not considering her situation. Therefore, the author might be at least partially in the wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the permission and the context. \n\nGiven that the author took the whole tray without asking, even after knowing the tray was big, maybe he's in the wrong. Because even if he had permission, taking the whole thing without ensuring she had leftovers was careless. So the answer is A.\n"
