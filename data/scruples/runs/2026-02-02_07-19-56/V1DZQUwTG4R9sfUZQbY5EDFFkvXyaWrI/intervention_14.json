She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the guy took his girlfriend's lasagna home after she made it for their date night. She said he could take some, but he took the whole tray. Now she's upset because she couldn't eat leftovers for the rest of the week and had to buy instant noodles. She's asking him to buy a sandwich to compensate, and he feels she should have been clearer, so he doesn't think he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The girlfriend said \"you could take lasagna home,\" but the guy took the whole tray. The question is whether \"some\" was implied, even if not explicitly stated. When someone offers to take some, the default assumption might be that they're taking a portion, not the entire thing, especially if the tray is big. The guy might not have realized that the entire tray was meant for leftovers. However, the girlfriend didn't specify the amount, so maybe she should have clarified. \n\nBut when she said \"take some,\" the guy might have thought \"some\" meant a part, not the whole. But in reality, \"take some\" can be ambiguous. However, considering the context\u2014she made it from scratch, spent a lot of money, and planned to eat leftovers\u2014it's reasonable that she expected him to take a portion, not the entire tray. The guy's defense is that she didn't explicitly say not to take the whole thing, but the problem is that he took all of it despite the implication that it was for leftovers. \n\nThe girlfriend is now upset and has to adjust her food budget because of this. The guy feels it's her fault for not being clear. However, the expectation when someone says \"you can take some\" is that the guest takes an appropriate amount, not the entirety. The guy might have overstepped by taking the whole thing without checking. \n\nAlso, when she asked where the lasagna was, he should have realized that maybe he took too much and offered to share or bring back some. Instead, he just explained that he took the whole tray. The girlfriend's request for a sandwich is a way to compensate, but the guy is reluctant. \n\nIn terms of fault, while the girlfriend could have been clearer, the guy took more than was reasonably expected. The key is whether taking the whole tray was a reasonable interpretation of \"take some.\" Since the tray was big and the purpose was leftovers, taking the whole tray left her with nothing. Therefore, the guy might be in the wrong for not considering her intended use for the leftovers and overstepping the implied generosity. \n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
