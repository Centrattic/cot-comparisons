She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the whole lasagna home even though the girlfriend said they could take some. The key points here are what was agreed upon and whether there was a misunderstanding.\n\nSo the girlfriend made lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take some home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, not just a portion. She didn't see him take it because she didn't walk him out. Then the next day, she's upset that he took the whole thing, leading to her having to eat instant noodles and now she's asking him to buy her a sandwich.\n\nThe author argues that he asked if he could take it home, and she didn't say no. He thought taking the whole tray was okay because she didn't specify. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought he would only take a portion, implying that the size of the tray should have been a hint.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the ambiguity in the request. When he asked if he could take it home, she said yes, but maybe didn't clarify that only a portion was allowed. However, taking the entire tray is a significant action that affects her food budget. Even though she didn't explicitly say \"only take some,\" maybe he should have considered the context. The tray being big might be a clue, but he might not have known her plans for leftovers. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have overstepped by taking the entire tray, even if he had permission. The girlfriend's reaction is about the financial impact and her plans, which he didn't consider. So while he had permission, the amount taken could be seen as excessive. Therefore, he might share some responsibility, but the girlfriend's unclear communication also plays a role. However, given that he was told \"yes\" and didn't clarify, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the size of the tray and her stated intention to have leftovers could imply that taking the whole thing was unreasonable. \n\nHmm. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because even though permission was given, taking the entire tray without considering her need for leftovers shows a lack of consideration. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he was given permission and didn't have explicit instructions. But the line between \"some\" and the whole thing might be the issue. The author could have asked for leftovers but didn't. Maybe he should have been more thoughtful. So leaning towards A.\n"
