She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking the whole lasagna after being given permission. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend made lasagna for their date night and allowed him to take some home. The key point is that she said \"yes\" when he asked if he could take it. He took the entire tray, not just some. The problem arises because she expected him to take only a portion, not the whole thing.\n\nNow, the author argues that since she didn't specify not to take the whole tray, he assumed it was okay. But the girlfriend's intention was to have leftovers for the week. The size of the tray might have been a factor in her expectation that he would take a part, not the entire thing. \n\nThe author did take the whole tray, leading to her having to improvise with limited food. She's now asking for a sandwich, which he feels is unfair. But did he overstep? Even though he had permission, taking the entire tray might have been a miscommunication. The author knew the tray was big but still took it all. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not considering the quantity. While the girlfriend could have been more explicit, the author should have been considerate of her food budget and planned to take only a portion. The fact that he took the whole tray without asking how much he could take suggests he didn't fully consider her needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author's action led to her problem. So, even though she could have been clearer, the author's action caused the issue. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
