She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for taking his girlfriend's entire lasagna home after she said he could take some. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night. She made everything from scratch, which probably took a lot of time and effort. The author asked if he could take some home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, didn't walk out with her, so she didn't see him take it. Then on Monday, she texts him about the missing lasagna. \n\nThe key points here are about interpretation of permission. The author asked if he could take \"some,\" and the girlfriend said yes. But when he took the whole tray, she felt he overstepped. The author argues that she didn't specify not taking the whole thing, so he assumed \"some\" could mean the entire tray, especially since it was a big tray. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he got permission to take some, but he took more than what was expected. The girlfriend had a specific reason for making it\u2014leftovers for the week. She spent her food budget on it, so taking the entire tray left her with nothing. \n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't say he couldn't take the whole tray. But in social contexts, when someone says \"you can take some,\" they usually expect the taker to leave some for themselves. The size of the tray might influence the perception of \"some,\" but it's not explicitly stated. \n\nSo, even though he had permission, interpreting \"some\" as the whole tray might not be reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is about the impact on her food budget, which is a valid concern. The author might be at fault for not considering that she would need leftovers. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend could have been clearer about not wanting the whole tray taken. But in most situations, people expect that taking \"some\" means taking a portion, not the entire thing, especially when the item is prepared for the taker's benefit. \n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because he took more than a reasonable amount, even with permission. The permission was for \"some,\" not the whole. The girlfriend's frustration is understandable because she ended up without food for the week, and the author's family consumed the entire tray. The author could have taken a portion and left some for her, which would have been more considerate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
