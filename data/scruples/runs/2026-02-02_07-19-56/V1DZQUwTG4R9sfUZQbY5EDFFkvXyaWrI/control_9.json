She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she gave permission.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. He didn't realize that she expected him to take only a portion, not the whole tray. The author took the whole thing, which left her without leftovers for the week. Now she's upset and wants him to buy her a sandwich. The author feels she should have been clearer.\n\nHmm. Well, the initial permission was given, so the author thought taking the whole tray was okay. But the girlfriend's food budget was spent on that lasagna, and she needed leftovers. The author took the whole tray, which she didn't realize he would do. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, maybe the girlfriend should have specified that only some could be taken. But the author might think that taking the whole tray is reasonable since he asked and was given permission. However, taking a large tray might be a bit much, especially if she intended to have leftovers. But the author might not have known her financial constraints. \n\nThe girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author feels is unreasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he asked and was told yes, but didn't clarify the amount, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that taking the whole tray might not be appropriate, especially since the tray was big. Maybe he should have taken some, not all. However, since the permission was given without any restrictions, the author might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, not considering her needs might make him at fault. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he followed the permission given, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the key is that the permission was yes, and she didn't specify. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have taken less. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of explicit permission, the author did ask and was allowed. So the responsibility could be on the girlfriend to specify the amount. So the answer is B.\n"
