She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's lasagna home after she said he could take some.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend made lasagna, they both ate it, he asked if he could take it home, she said yes. He took the whole tray without her knowing. She didn't walk him out, so she didn't see him take it. Then the next day, she's upset because he took all of it, not just some. She had planned to eat leftovers for the week. He apologized but thought he had permission. She felt it was obvious he shouldn't take the whole thing because the tray was big. Now she's asking him to buy her a sandwich, and he's not willing, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether he overstepped by taking the whole lasagna despite the permission. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he asked if he could take it, and she said yes. He didn't realize that she expected only a portion. But the problem here is that she didn't specify the quantity. However, taking the entire tray might be seen as taking advantage of her generosity, even if she said yes. The fact that she had planned to use the leftovers for the week is a key point. He might have known the tray was big, but maybe he didn't consider her need to have leftovers. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did ask and she didn't specify. So he might have thought taking the whole thing was okay. But maybe the expectation was that \"take some\" meant just a part. The problem is that the permission was given without clarity on quantity. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if she said yes, maybe he should have been more considerate of her budget and intentions. But it's also possible that she should have clarified her boundaries when he asked. However, the fact that she's now upset and asking for reimbursement complicates things. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because even though he had permission, he didn't consider her financial planning. Taking the whole tray left her without food, which is a significant impact. Maybe he should have asked for clarification on how much to take. Alternatively, she might have been too vague in her permission. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he took the whole tray without realizing her plan for leftovers, even if she gave permission. The size of the tray and her budget were factors he should have considered. So the answer might be A.\n"
