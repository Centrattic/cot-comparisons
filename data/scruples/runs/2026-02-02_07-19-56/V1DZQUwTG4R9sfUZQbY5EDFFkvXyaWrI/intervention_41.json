She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home after she said \"yes\" to taking some home. The key points here are permission and expectations.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take some home, and she said yes. Then he took the entire tray. She didn't walk him out, so she didn't see him take it. The next day, she's upset because he took the whole thing, which was supposed to be leftovers for the week. She's now having to eat instant noodles and wants a sandwich from him. He feels she should have been clearer.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether taking the whole tray was reasonable. The author asked for permission, which was granted. But the girlfriend expected only \"some\" to be taken. The problem here is about what constitutes \"some.\" The author took the entire tray, which was a large portion. Even though he had permission, maybe he should have considered the size and the fact that it was meant for leftovers. The girlfriend's food budget was spent on this, so she's now in a bind.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might have thought \"some\" meant a portion, not the entire meal. The author might have assumed \"yes\" meant he could take the whole thing. However, the size of the tray was a clue that it was meant for multiple meals. The author didn't ask for clarification about the amount. Even if the permission was given, not realizing the implications of taking the whole tray could be on him. But since she didn't specify \"some\" versus the whole, maybe the onus was on her to be clear. \n\nHowever, taking an entire tray that's clearly meant for leftovers might be overstepping, even with permission. The author had the chance to ask for how much, but didn't. The girlfriend is now in a tough spot, and the author's actions caused that. Even if he had permission, the amount taken could be seen as excessive given the context. So perhaps the author is at fault for not considering the size and the intended use of the leftovers. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
