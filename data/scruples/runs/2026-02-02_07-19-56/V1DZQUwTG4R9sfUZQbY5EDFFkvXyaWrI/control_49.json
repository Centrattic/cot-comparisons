She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend made a big lasagna, and the guy asked if he could take it home. She said yes, but didn't walk him out, so he took the whole tray. Then she got upset because he took the entire thing instead of just some leftovers.\n\nFirst, the guy explicitly asked if he could take the lasagna home. She gave permission, so he thought it was okay. But she later implied that he should have taken only some of it. The problem here is that she didn't clarify her expectations. She might have assumed that \"taking it home\" meant taking a portion, not the whole tray. However, when someone says \"you can take it home,\" it's usually understood that you can take the food they're offering. If she wanted to limit it to some leftovers, she should have specified that.\n\nThe tray was big, and the guy's family ate it over two dinners. She was planning to eat the leftovers for the week. She spent her food budget on it, so when he took the whole tray, she had to eat instant noodles. She's now asking him to buy her a sandwich. The guy feels she should have been clearer about not wanting him to take the whole thing. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she didn't set boundaries. When someone gives permission without details, the person taking it might not realize the quantity. The guy didn't take it secretly; he asked and was given the go-ahead. However, the size of the tray could have been a hint, but it's not necessarily obvious. People might not realize the extent of the food budget spent. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, he followed her instruction. She didn't specify. But maybe he could have offered to leave some. But since she said yes, he probably thought it was okay. The fact that he took the whole thing without checking again might be a bit of a mistake, but she didn't tell him not to. The main issue is her not clarifying. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. However, since he was given permission, he's not the one at fault.\n"
