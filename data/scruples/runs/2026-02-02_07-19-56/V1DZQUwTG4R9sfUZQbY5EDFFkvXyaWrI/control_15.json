She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their girlfriend's homemade lasagna home. The key points here are consent and clarity.\n\nSo, the girlfriend made the lasagna and told the author he could take it home. The author took the whole tray, and the girlfriend later got upset because he took all instead of just some. She mentioned she needed leftovers for the week and now she's struggling with her food budget. The author argues that since she didn't specify not to take the whole thing, he was okay to do so.\n\nHmm. First, the girlfriend did give permission for him to take it home. The problem is whether the permission was given for the entire tray or just a portion. The author thought the whole tray was okay, but the girlfriend expected only some. The author might have misunderstood the extent of the permission. Even though she said \"you could take it home,\" maybe she assumed he would take some and leave leftovers for her. The author didn't consider that perhaps she wanted to keep some for herself, especially since she mentioned her budget. \n\nBut the author did ask, and the girlfriend didn't say no. However, the girlfriend might have thought he would just take a couple of pieces. The tray was big, which is a hint, but the author didn't pick up on that. The girlfriend's intention was to eat leftovers for the week, so not having them caused her to buy instant noodles. The author's family of five ate the whole tray over two days, which could have been more than she intended him to take. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. The author got permission, but maybe the request was for a portion, not the entire dish. The girlfriend's frustration is about the unexpected outcome. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could have been more considerate by leaving at least some for her. The answer depends on whether taking the whole tray without clarification was reasonable. Since the girlfriend didn't specify the amount, the author might have a point, but the impact on her was significant. So maybe the author is a bit at fault for not being more thoughtful about her intentions, even if she didn't explicitly say to leave some. The girlfriend's reaction might be a bit harsh, but the situation shows the author could have handled it better. I think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even with permission, taking the entire tray without checking if there's a specific amount might have been inconsiderate.\n"
