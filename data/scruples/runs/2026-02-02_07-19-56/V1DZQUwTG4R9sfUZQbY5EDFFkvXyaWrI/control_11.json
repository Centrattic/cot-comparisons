She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy took the entire lasagna home after his girlfriend said he could take it. She agreed, but later got upset because he took the whole tray. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, when she said \"yes\" to taking the lasagna home, she didn't specify taking just some. He interpreted her permission as taking the whole thing. She argues that the tray was big, so it should have been obvious not to take all. But he asked for permission, and she didn't say otherwise. She might have expected leftovers for herself, but maybe that expectation wasn't clear. \n\nHowever, she might have reasonably expected that taking the entire tray would leave her with nothing. Even if he was allowed to take it, maybe there's an unspoken understanding that you don't take all when it's meant to have leftovers. But he did ask, and she didn't stop him. So legally or by explicit agreement, he's within his rights. \n\nOn the other hand, socially, he might have overstepped. The key is communication. She didn't clarify, but he might have assumed she wanted to save some. However, since she explicitly allowed him to take it, the responsibility could be on her to specify the amount. Now she's asking him to buy her food, which he feels is unfair. \n\nHe apologized, but she's still upset. The issue is whether his action was a breach of trust or unspoken expectations. Since he followed her permission literally, he's not wrong, but maybe he should have considered her needs. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the answer hinges on whether he should have known not to take all, then maybe A. But if it's about explicit permission, then B. I think the answer leans towards A because even though she said yes, taking the whole tray left her without meals, which he should have been considerate of. However, since she didn't specify, it's a bit of a gray area. Maybe B because he followed her permission, but it's a judgment call. I'm torn, but probably B because he asked and she didn't say no.\n"
