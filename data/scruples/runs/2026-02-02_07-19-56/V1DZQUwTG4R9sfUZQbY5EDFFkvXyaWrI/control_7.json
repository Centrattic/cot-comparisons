She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home. \n\nSo, the setup: They're both in college. Girlfriend made lasagna for their date night. The guy asked if he could take it home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray. She later got upset because she wanted leftovers for the week, and now she's eating instant noodles. She says he should have only taken some, not all. He argues that since he asked and she said yes, he's not wrong. She's now asking him to buy a sandwich.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is at fault. Let me break it down. He asked if he could take it, she said yes. But maybe there's an assumption here. When someone says \"you can take it home,\" does that mean the whole thing? Or is there an unspoken understanding that you take some, not all? \n\nThe girlfriend might expect that when you take leftovers, you take a portion, not the entire meal. Especially since she made it with the intention of having leftovers. The author took the whole tray, which was big. The girlfriend's food budget was spent on that lasagna, so she's now in a bind. \n\nEven though the author asked and was given permission, the key point is what was expected. If you ask if you can take some, maybe the assumption is that you take \"some,\" not the entire thing. So even with permission, there's a social norm here. The author might have overstepped by taking the whole tray, not considering her need for leftovers.\n\nAlso, the author's defense is that the size of the tray doesn't make it obvious. But maybe the size is part of the issue. If it's a big tray, maybe she expected to have leftovers, and taking the whole tray made it impossible. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to the girlfriend having to eat instant noodles, which caused her stress. He apologized but thinks it's her fault for not being clear. However, social norms might suggest that taking the entire dish without specifying could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she had to eat instant noodles is a consequence he might be responsible for, even if she didn't specify. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her intentions when taking the entire tray, despite her not explicitly saying not to. The expectation when taking leftovers is usually to take part of it, not all, unless the host indicates otherwise. Since she said \"you can take it,\" but didn't specify the quantity, he should have taken a reasonable amount. Taking the whole tray was inconsiderate, leading to her financial strain. Hence, Answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
