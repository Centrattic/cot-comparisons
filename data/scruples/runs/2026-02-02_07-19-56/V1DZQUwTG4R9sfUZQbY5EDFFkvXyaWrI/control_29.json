She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author took their girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take some. The author took the whole tray, and the girlfriend was upset because she expected leftovers for the week. The author says they asked permission and the girlfriend didn't stop them, but she now feels the tray was too big and it's all gone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When someone says you can take some, does it imply taking the whole thing? Maybe not. If someone offers you \"some,\" they might expect you to take a portion, not the entire dish. But the author did ask permission, and the girlfriend didn't specify that they couldn't take the whole tray. However, the tray was big, and maybe the size was a factor in her expectation that it wasn't meant to be taken entirely. \n\nAlso, the author took it home when she didn't see them leave. So she might not have realized immediately. But when she did find out, she was upset. The author's reasoning is that since they asked and she said yes, it's her fault for not being clear. But in social situations, sometimes people assume that taking \"some\" is just a small portion, not the whole thing. The girlfriend might have thought the author would take a reasonable amount, not the whole tray. \n\nThe fact that the author's family of five ate it over two days suggests that the tray was indeed large. So maybe the size was a hint. The girlfriend spent her food budget on it with the intention of having leftovers. The author's action left her with no food for the week, leading her to eat instant noodles. The girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author feels is unfair. \n\nBut the key point is about communication. The author did ask, but maybe didn't specify how much. The girlfriend might assume that taking the whole tray wasn't intended. The author didn't consider that maybe the size of the tray implied leftovers, so taking it all wasn't appropriate. Even with permission, the author might have overstepped by taking the entire dish. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was reasonable. While they got permission, taking the whole tray might not have been what the girlfriend expected when she said \"you could take lasagna home.\" The author might have failed to read the social cues, like the tray's size. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because they didn't consider the context of the size and the intent behind the food budget. The girlfriend's frustration is valid, and the author's insistence on not helping now might seem selfish.\n"
