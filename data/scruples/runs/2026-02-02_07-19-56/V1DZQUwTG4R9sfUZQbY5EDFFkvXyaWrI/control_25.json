She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author taking his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could take some. Now she's upset because he took the whole tray, not just a portion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take some home, and she said yes. He took the entire tray without her seeing him. Then she got upset because he took all of it, leaving her with nothing for the week. She claims she thought he would only take some, not the whole thing. The author argues that she didn't specify not to take the whole tray, and he had a family of five to feed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about clarity of communication. The author asked if he could take it home, and she agreed. But did her agreement cover taking the whole tray? The author might have interpreted \"you can take it home\" as taking the whole thing, while the girlfriend expected just a portion. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, maybe the girlfriend should have been more specific. However, the author also might have considered that taking the entire tray could be excessive, especially considering she spent her food budget on it. Even if she gave permission, taking the whole tray could be seen as not considering her needs. The fact that the tray was big doesn't automatically make it obvious, but the author could have taken only a reasonable amount. \n\nThe girlfriend is now asking him to buy her a sandwich to compensate, which the author thinks is unfair. But she's in a tough spot with no food left. The author's family ate the lasagna over two nights, so maybe they could have been more mindful. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author might share some responsibility for not checking if she wanted him to take only a portion. Even though he had permission, the amount taken might have been unreasonable. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't clarify the quantity, which could also be a point. But since he took the whole tray and caused her financial distress, he's likely at fault here. The fact that he took it without her knowing also adds to the issue. So, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong).\n"
