She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took their girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take it. The girlfriend ended up needing the leftovers for the week, but the author took the whole tray, leading to her having to eat instant noodles and now she wants the author to buy her a sandwich.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: the author asked if they could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. The author didn't see her take it, and the girlfriend later complained about taking the whole tray. The author argues that since she didn't specify taking just some, he was within his right. The girlfriend felt the size of the tray should have been obvious that only part was meant to be taken.\n\nHmm. So, when someone says \"you can take it home,\" does that imply taking the whole thing? I think it depends on common social norms. Usually, if someone offers you food, especially leftovers, it's expected that you take some, but not all. If you take all of it, it's considered impolite unless the person explicitly says you can take it all. For example, if she had said \"take the whole tray,\" then it's clear. But she just said \"yes\" to taking it home. The author might have assumed he could take some, but the girlfriend expected leftovers for the week. \n\nThe tray was big, and the author took the whole thing. The girlfriend's food budget was spent on making the lasagna, so she relied on leftovers. The author's family of five ate it over two nights, which probably used up all the leftovers. \n\nSo, even though the girlfriend said \"yes,\" the author didn't clarify the amount. In social interactions, taking the entire portion when the host still needs leftovers might be seen as inconsiderate. The author should have maybe asked how much to take, or left enough for the girlfriend. The fact that she had to eat instant noodles because of this shows that the author's action caused her financial strain. \n\nThe girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich as compensation. The author feels she's being unreasonable, but maybe the author did overstep by not considering that she needed the leftovers. Even if the permission was given, the amount taken was excessive given the context. So, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate of her needs and the implications of taking the whole tray.\n"
