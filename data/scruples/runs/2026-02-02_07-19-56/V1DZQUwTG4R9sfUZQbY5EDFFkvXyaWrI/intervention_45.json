She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's lasagna home after she said it was okay. The author took the whole tray, and the girlfriend was upset because she expected some leftovers for the week. The author thinks the girlfriend should have been clearer, but she's now asking him to buy a sandwich and calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. However, she didn't specify that only part of it should be taken. The author assumed he could take the whole tray, which was a big tray. But the girlfriend's intention was to have leftovers for the week. So there's a miscommunication. The author might not have realized the full extent of her plans. But since he was given permission, even if it was a general yes, maybe he should have considered that taking the whole thing might not be appropriate, especially since it was a big portion. The girlfriend's budget was affected, leading to her having to eat instant noodles, which is a valid concern. The author's reasoning is that he was allowed to take it, but maybe he overstepped by taking the entire tray without clarifying the quantity. The girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author feels is not justified. But given that the lasagna was a gift and she didn't expect the whole thing to be taken, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate. So I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the girlfriend could have been clearer too. However, since the author acted on the permission given but didn't consider the context, he might be at fault. The main point is that the author should have thought about the size and her plans before taking the whole tray.\n"
