She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took his girlfriend's lasagna home after she said he could. She later got upset because he took the whole tray, not just some, and now she's asking him to buy a sandwich. The author is defending himself by saying he asked first and she didn't specify not to take the whole thing.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take it home, and she agreed. He took the entire tray without her seeing him leave. She then felt wronged because she intended to have leftovers for the week. The author's defense is that he had permission and the size of the tray wasn't an indicator he shouldn't take it all.\n\nNow, considering the norms of such situations. When someone gives permission to take something, they expect it to be reasonable. The author took the entire tray, which she didn't expect. Even though she said \"you can take it home,\" she might have assumed he would take a portion, not the whole thing. The size of the tray might have been a clue, but the author might not have realized. However, the key here is that the author took the whole tray despite knowing she made a big batch for leftovers. He might have overstepped by not considering her intention to have leftovers. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is now asking him to buy a sandwich as compensation. The author feels she's being unreasonable because he had permission. But she's upset because he took her food budget's worth. The question is whether the author should have taken only a portion. Even if he had permission, taking the entire tray without checking on her intentions might be seen as not considering her needs. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone shares food, especially homemade and costly, the expectation is to take a reasonable amount, leaving leftovers for the host. The author might have overestimated his right by taking the whole thing, even with permission, because he didn't account for her needing leftovers. So, while he did ask, the way he interpreted the permission might have been incorrect. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not taking only a portion, even if he had explicit permission. The girlfriend's reaction is about the impact on her food budget, which the author didn't consider. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the permission was clear and she didn't specify, maybe not. But in social contexts, people often assume that taking the whole thing isn't appropriate unless the host says explicitly that it's okay. So the author might be at fault for not reading her intentions better.\n"
