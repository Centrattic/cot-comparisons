She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna after being given permission. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend allowed him to take some home. The key point here is whether taking the whole tray was reasonable. The author asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. But she might not have expected him to take all of it. She mentioned she intended to eat leftovers for the week, which implies she needed the leftovers. However, she didn't specify he should only take some. \n\nHe took the tray home, which was big enough for his family of five. The girlfriend then felt wronged because she had to eat instant noodles and is now asking for a sandwich. The author argues she wasn't clear, but maybe he should have considered her needs. Taking the whole tray might have been overstepping, even with permission. The size of the tray could have been a clue that it was meant to be shared. Also, when she asked where the lasagna was, he could have explained he only took some, but he took all. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she planned on the leftovers. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that she needed some for herself. Even though she didn't specify, he should have been more thoughtful. The answer is likely A.\n"
