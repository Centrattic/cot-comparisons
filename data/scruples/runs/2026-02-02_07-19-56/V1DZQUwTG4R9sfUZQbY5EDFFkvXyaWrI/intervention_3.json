She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author's girlfriend made lasagna for their date night. After they finished eating, the author asked if he could take some home, and the girlfriend agreed. He took the whole tray, not just some. When she found out, she was upset because she intended to have leftovers for the week. The author says she didn't specify that he should only take a portion, but she argues that the size of the tray should have been a clue. Now she's asking him to buy her a sandwich, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author asked for permission to take the lasagna, and the girlfriend said yes. However, he assumed taking the whole tray was okay. But maybe she expected him to take just a portion. The problem is that the author didn't clarify the quantity, even though she had a specific plan for the leftovers. \n\nEven though she didn't explicitly say \"only take half,\" the fact that the tray was big might have been a hint. But the author could have asked how much he could take. He took the whole thing without confirming, which might have been careless. She ended up in a bad spot financially because of this. \n\nThe author's argument is that she should have been clearer, but in relationships, sometimes you have to consider the other person's needs and circumstances. The author might have known that taking the entire tray could leave her without food for the week. So, even with permission, taking the whole tray without checking if it's okay might be inconsiderate. \n\nAdditionally, when she asked for a sandwich, the author's refusal could be seen as not being supportive. Maybe there's an expectation to make amends. However, the initial action of taking the whole tray is where the issue started. \n\nSo, in terms of fault, the author might be at least partially in the wrong for not considering her situation more carefully. Even if she didn't specify, he could have asked or taken a portion. The size of the tray was a red flag he might have ignored. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
