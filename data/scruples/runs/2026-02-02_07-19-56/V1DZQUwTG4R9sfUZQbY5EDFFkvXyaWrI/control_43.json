She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who took the lasagna) is in the wrong. Let's look at the details.\n\nSo, the girlfriend made a big lasagna for their date night. After finishing, the author asked if he could take the lasagna home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray. She didn't see him take it because she didn't walk him out. \n\nThen on Monday, she texts him asking where the lasagna is. He explains he took it home. She's upset because she thought he would take some, not all. She mentions she spent her food budget on it and now has nothing left. The author apologized but pointed out he asked and she didn't say no. She argues the tray was big, so he should have known not to take it all. The author's family ate it over two days, so it was a big tray. Now she's asking for a sandwich, and he's reluctant, thinking it's her fault for not being clear.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, he asked and was given permission. So technically, he did what she allowed. However, maybe there's an expectation when someone says \"you can take some\" that you take a portion, not the whole thing. The problem might be that the author took the entire tray without clarifying. Even though she said yes, maybe the quantity was implied. The girlfriend's intent was to have leftovers for the week, so taking the whole thing defeated that purpose. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he thought taking the whole tray was acceptable since he was given permission. However, maybe he should have considered the size and her intent. The fact that she later complained about having to eat instant noodles suggests that the action caused her financial hardship. The author might have a responsibility to acknowledge her situation and help out, even if it wasn't his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, she could have been more explicit about not wanting him to take the whole thing. The author might not be in the wrong if he followed her explicit permission. However, the situation could be seen as a miscommunication. The key points are: permission was given, but the interpretation of \"take it home\" might differ. The author could have asked for clarification about how much to take. \n\nSo, is it about explicit instructions? Since the author didn't ask how much to take, maybe he should have assumed a reasonable amount rather than the whole tray. The big tray's size might imply that taking all of it was not intended. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he took all of it without checking, even though he was given permission. Alternatively, if the permission was clear, then maybe he isn't. But given that she had leftovers planned, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because even though he had permission, taking the entire tray without considering her intent might be at fault. The fact that she had to eat instant noodles and is now asking for a sandwich shows that his action caused her significant inconvenience. Even if the fault is shared, the responsibility might lie more with him because he could have taken only some. So, the answer is A.\n"
