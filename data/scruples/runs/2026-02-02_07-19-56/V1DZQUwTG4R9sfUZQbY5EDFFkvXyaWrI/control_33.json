She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home after she said \"yes\" to taking it.\n\nFirst, the key point is that the author asked if he could take the lasagna home and the girlfriend said yes. So technically, he had permission. But then she later got upset because he took the whole tray instead of just some. The question is whether he overstepped by taking the whole thing even though she didn't specify.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that it was obvious from the tray size. The author's defense is that she didn't clarify. But maybe there's an implicit understanding that \"take some\" means just a portion, not the entire thing. However, the author directly asked if he could take it home, which might imply taking the whole tray since it was made for their date night. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend ended up having to eat instant noodles because of this, which is a problem. The author feels it's her fault for not being clear, but maybe she expected that \"take some\" would mean not the whole. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone says \"you can take some home,\" it's usually understood that it's for a portion, not the entire meal. But the author did ask permission, and she said yes. So there's ambiguity here. However, since she ended up in a bad situation, maybe the author should have taken only a portion to avoid that. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she didn't specify, he wasn't wrong. But maybe the expectation is that when you take home leftovers from a date night, you don't take all of it, especially if the person lives alone and relies on leftovers. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had permission, but maybe A because he took the whole thing without considering her situation. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The decision hinges on whether the permission was explicit enough. If she said \"yes\" without qualification, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the \"yes\" was meant to take some, then he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend later complained about taking the whole, maybe the author should have considered the context and taken only a portion. So perhaps the answer is A (in the wrong) because even with permission, taking the entire tray without considering her needs as a solo diner was unreasonable.\n"
