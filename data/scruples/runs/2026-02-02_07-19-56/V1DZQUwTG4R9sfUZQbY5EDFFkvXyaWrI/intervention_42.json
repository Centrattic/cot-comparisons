She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could take some. The girlfriend then got upset because he took the entire tray, not just some, which left her with nothing for the rest of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. She didn't specify that he could only take part of it. He took the whole tray, which was big enough for his family of five. The girlfriend later complained and asked him to buy her a sandwich because she had to eat instant noodles instead of using the leftovers.\n\nThe main issue is whether taking the whole tray was wrong even though he was given permission. Permission was granted, but the girlfriend's intention might have been for him to take some, not all. However, the author interpreted the permission as taking the whole tray, especially since the size was large. But is the size a factor? The girlfriend might have expected leftovers for herself, but she didn't clarify that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have assumed he could take some, but taking all might have been an overreach. Even though he had permission, not considering that the recipient might need leftovers could be a mistake. The girlfriend's food budget was affected, and she's asking for compensation, which the author feels is unfair. \n\nBut the author also points out that he was given permission without any restrictions. The problem is that the permission was ambiguous. Did he overstep by taking the entire tray? It's possible. Even if she didn't walk him out, he left with the tray, which she might have expected him to leave some for her. The size of the tray might not be an excuse for not leaving leftovers. \n\nSo, the author's defense is that he had permission, but the girlfriend's argument is that he should have known not to take all. The question is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. If the permission was given without specifying the amount, it's a gray area. However, taking all might have been inconsiderate, even if technically allowed. \n\nIn many social situations, when someone offers to take leftover food, it's customary to leave enough for the host. The author might not have considered that, leading to the conflict. Therefore, he might be at least partially at fault for not leaving some for her, even if he had permission. The girlfriend's request for a sandwich might be excessive, but her situation is also understandable because her budget was affected. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider her need for leftovers, even though he had permission.\n"
