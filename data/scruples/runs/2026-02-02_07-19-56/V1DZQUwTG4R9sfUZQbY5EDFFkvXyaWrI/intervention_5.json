She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home when their girlfriend said they could take some. The girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night and agreed when he asked to take it home. The key here is whether \"some\" was implied versus taking the whole tray.\n\nThe author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. The problem arises because she expected him to take only a portion, not the whole tray. The author took the entire tray, leading to her having to eat instant noodles and now asking for a sandwich. \n\nThe author's defense is that the girlfriend didn't specify not taking the whole thing. However, the girlfriend argues that the size of the tray should have been a clue. But the author's family ate it over two nights, indicating the tray was indeed large. \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. When someone offers to take leftovers, it's generally understood to take a portion, not the whole. Even if asked, taking the entire tray might be seen as overstepping. The author's action led to her financial stress, so he should have considered her situation. While she should have been clearer, the author's action was the direct cause. So, he's partly responsible. But since he asked and was allowed, maybe not entirely. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. But typically, taking the whole leftovers without being told is seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is A.\n"
