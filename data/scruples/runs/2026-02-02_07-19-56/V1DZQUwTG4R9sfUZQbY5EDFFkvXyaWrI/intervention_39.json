She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the whole tray of lasagna home even though the girlfriend said he could take some. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend did say he could take it home. But she might have expected him to take just some, not the whole tray. The key point is whether the author should have known that taking the entire tray was unreasonable. The girlfriend mentions she made it for the week's leftovers, so maybe the author should have considered that. \n\nBut the author asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. She didn't specify not the whole thing. So maybe he thought it was okay. However, the tray was really big, and the girlfriend's intention was to have leftovers for the week. The author's family of five ate it over two nights, which might have been a lot. \n\nThe girlfriend is now upset because she didn't have food for the rest of the week. She even had to eat instant noodles to stay within her budget. She's asking the author to buy a sandwich. The author feels it's her fault for not being clear. \n\nHmm. The author got permission, but maybe he should have taken only a portion. Even though she didn't specify, maybe the size of the tray was a clue. The author might have been a bit inconsiderate by taking the whole thing, expecting her to have leftovers. But since she gave permission, maybe he's not entirely wrong. Still, he could have asked to take half or something. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but the author's actions led to her needing to eat instant noodles. So maybe the author is partially at fault. \n\nIn the end, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he took the whole tray without considering her need for leftovers, even though she gave permission. The permission might have been for some, not all.\n"
