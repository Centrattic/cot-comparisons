She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could. She made it from scratch, and he took the whole tray. Now she's upset because she needed the leftovers for the rest of the week and had to spend her budget on it. She's asking him to buy her a sandwich, and he's wondering if she's justified.\n\nFirst, the author did ask if he could take it home, and she said yes. So technically, he wasn't told not to take the whole tray. But the girlfriend might have expected that when she said \"you can take it home,\" he would take some, not all. Maybe she assumed he would leave some for her. The tray was big, and she intended to eat leftovers all week. So even though he had permission, taking the entire tray might have been a misunderstanding. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author might have thought taking the whole tray was okay, but his girlfriend clearly didn't expect that. She spent her food budget on it, so she's in a tight spot now. Even if he had permission, maybe he should have considered her needs and taken only part. The author's defense is that she didn't specify not to take the whole thing, but maybe she expected that common sense. \n\nAlso, his response to not buy the sandwich makes him seem a bit dismissive. She's in a difficult situation because of his action, and he's not helping. That could be seen as not taking responsibility. Even if he wasn't wrong in taking the lasagna, not helping her now might be making things worse. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe both sides have some responsibility. He took the lasagna, but she didn't clarify the amount. However, since she needed it for the week, and he took all of it, he might have overstepped. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because even with permission, taking the entire tray without considering her needs could be seen as not being considerate. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the permission was enough. But I think the fact that she had to eat instant noodles and he's not helping now complicates it. Maybe he's partially at fault for taking all of it, so the answer would be A.\n"
