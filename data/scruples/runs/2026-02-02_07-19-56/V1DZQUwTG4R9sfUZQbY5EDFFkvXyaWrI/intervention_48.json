She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home after the girlfriend said yes. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girl made a big lasagna tray for their date night. The guy asked if he could take it home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, didn't realize she wanted him to take just some. Then she got upset because she spent her budget on it and now can't eat leftovers. She's asking him to buy a sandwich now.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether taking the whole tray was wrong. The author argued that she didn't specify not taking the whole thing, so he thought it was okay. But the problem here is about communication and expectations. When someone says \"yes\" to taking some, it's generally implied that you take a reasonable portion, not the entire meal. The size of the tray might be a clue, but the author should have considered that maybe she wanted leftovers. \n\nEven though she didn't explicitly say \"don't take all,\" the author's action of taking the whole tray could be seen as overstepping. She might have expected him to take a portion, not all. So, the author might have misinterpreted her permission. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author thinks isn't justified. But the author's taking the whole tray caused her financial stress. While the author did ask and got permission, the action of taking everything might not have been the best, especially considering the context of her budget. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have clarified, like asking how much she wanted him to take or if she needed leftovers. Since he didn't and took the entire tray, leading to her inconvenience, that's where the miscommunication happened. So, the author is partially at fault for not being considerate enough in interpreting her permission.\n"
