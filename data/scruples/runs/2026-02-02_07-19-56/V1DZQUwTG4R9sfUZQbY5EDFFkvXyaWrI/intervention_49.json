She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by taking the entire lasagna home even though the girlfriend ended up being upset because she needed leftovers for the week.\n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend made a big lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take some home for his family, and she said yes. He took the whole tray, but she didn't see him take it. Later, she got upset because she expected him to take just some, not all, and now she's stuck with instant noodles.\n\nSo the key points here are about consent and clarity. The author asked if he could take it, and she agreed. But her agreement might have been to take some, not the entire tray. The author might have assumed that \"taking it home\" meant the whole thing, but maybe she thought he meant just part of it. \n\nBut wait, when someone says \"you can take lasagna home,\" does that imply the entire tray? Maybe not. The girlfriend probably expected leftovers for herself. The author took the whole thing, which left her with nothing. Even though she didn't specify, maybe he should have known that leaving enough for her was part of the deal. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the tray was really big. Maybe he should have considered that size and realized that taking the whole tray would leave her without enough. However, he did ask permission, and she didn't say no. So maybe she's responsible for not clarifying her expectations. \n\nBut here's the thing: when you take something home, especially leftovers, the norm is to leave enough for the host. It's common courtesy to leave some for them. The author took the entire tray, which is more than just \"some.\" Even if he asked, the social expectation might be that you don't take the entire dish unless the host explicitly says it's okay. \n\nThe girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author finds unreasonable. But the issue is that he took the whole lasagna, which she needed for the week. Even if he had the permission to take some, taking all of it without checking if she needed leftovers was probably inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he took the entire tray despite it being a large portion, without confirming if that was okay. Even though he asked for permission, the permission might have been for a portion, not the whole thing. The author should have been more considerate and left some for her.\n"
