She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about whether taking the whole lasagna was wrong even though the girlfriend said it was okay.\n\nFirst, the guy asked if he could take the lasagna home, and she said yes. So he thought he had permission. But she later got upset because he took the whole tray instead of just some. The key point here is whether her \"yes\" was explicit enough to cover taking the entire tray. \n\nHe might have assumed that \"taking it home\" meant the whole tray, especially since she didn't specify any portion. But she probably expected him to take some, not all. The size of the tray is mentioned as big, but he didn't know she needed leftovers for the week. \n\nMaybe he should have checked if she wanted him to take the whole thing. Even if she said \"yes,\" maybe there's an implied understanding that she'd still have leftovers. But she didn't clarify, so he acted on his understanding. However, in relationships, sometimes we need to read between the lines. If she made it for a date night, maybe she intended to have leftovers for herself. \n\nBut technically, she gave permission, so he didn't break any explicit rule. However, the fact that she spent her whole budget on it and now has nothing left might make her feel used. The guy didn't consider that she might need the leftovers. Maybe he should have taken only half or left some. But since she didn't specify, he can't be blamed entirely. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he followed her permission literally, then no. But if there was an unspoken expectation that she'd have leftovers, then yes. It's a bit of a gray area. I think it's more on her to have been clearer. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
