She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking the whole lasagna when the girlfriend only intended for some to be taken.\n\nFirst, the author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. So technically, he followed her permission. But she later said she meant \"some\" and not the whole tray. The key point is whether the author should have known she didn't mean the entire tray.\n\nThe tray was big, and she planned to eat leftovers for the week. The author took the whole tray, which led to her having to eat instant noodles. But he had permission. The author might think he wasn't wrong since she didn't specify. However, maybe he should have considered that a large tray was meant to last her, so taking all might be unreasonable even with permission.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is now asking him to buy a sandwich to compensate. The author feels she should have been clearer. The question is whether the author's action was wrong despite her initial consent. Maybe the author didn't do anything wrong because he was given permission, but he could have been more considerate. Alternatively, even with permission, taking the whole tray might be seen as not thinking about her needs.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the permission was ambiguous. Since she said \"yes\" but didn't specify the amount, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's an expectation to leave some. However, in legal terms, once permission is given, the author acted within that. So maybe answer B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A because of not considering her needs. The Reddit-style answer would likely say B, but the girlfriend's reaction might make people feel the author should have been more thoughtful. Hmm. I think the answer is B because he took it with permission, but he could have been more considerate. Since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B.\n"
