She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna despite the girlfriend's comment about expecting only \"some.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend made a big lasagna tray and said the author could take it home. The author took the whole tray, not just some. The girlfriend later complained because she intended to have leftovers for the week and now has to eat instant noodles. She's now asking the author to buy her a sandwich as compensation, which he refuses, leading her to call him an asshole.\n\nThe author argues that he asked if he could take it home, and she didn't specify to take only some. He also mentions the tray was big, but he thinks the size alone doesn't make it obvious not to take all. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone gives permission to take something home, it's usually understood to take a portion, not the entire dish unless specified. The phrase \"take some\" is commonly interpreted as taking a part, not the entire container. Even if the author asked, the girlfriend might have assumed he would take a reasonable amount, not the whole tray. Her subsequent complaints about the food budget and needing to eat instant noodles suggest that the entire takeout was unexpected and inconvenient.\n\nThe author might have overstepped by taking the entire tray, even though he was given permission. The girlfriend's intention was to have leftovers, so taking the whole tray negated that. While she didn't explicitly say \"take half,\" it's possible that the size of the tray and the context (date night with leftovers in mind) should have been considered. However, the author might not have been aware of her budget constraints. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is about clear communication. The author followed the given permission but missed the implied context. The girlfriend's reaction is about the consequences of her budget being affected, which isn't something the author could have known unless she specified. However, by taking the whole tray, he might have acted inconsiderately, even if unintentionally. The author's refusal to buy the sandwich could be seen as dismissive of her situation, especially if he acknowledges her budget issues but still doesn't offer help. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely at fault for not knowing the budget aspect, he did take the entire tray when the context implied she wanted leftovers. The girlfriend might be in the right to ask for help, given the financial impact, even if the situation wasn't clearly communicated. Therefore, the author could be partially at fault for not considering the broader implications of taking the entire dish.\n"
