She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take some. The writer got permission, took the whole tray, and the girlfriend was upset because she expected only some, not all. Now she's asking him to buy her food, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend made lasagna for date night, which the writer asked to take home. She said yes, but didn't see him take the tray. The tray was big, and he ended up taking the whole thing. She later complained about the size of the tray implying she thought he should know not to take all. The writer feels she should have been clearer, and he's not okay with buying her lunch.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The permission given was general (\"you could take it home\"), but the girlfriend expected leftovers. The writer took the whole thing, which might be seen as overstepping even with permission. The size of the tray could imply that it's meant to be eaten over multiple days, so taking the entire tray might not be what she intended. Even though she didn't specify, the writer could have asked how much to take. The girlfriend is now in a tough spot with her budget, and the writer might be expected to help out, but he feels she should have been clearer. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The writer might have thought taking some meant a portion, but the girlfriend thought he should leave leftovers. Since the permission wasn't explicit, the writer could be seen as assuming too much. However, the girlfriend could have clarified her expectations. But given that she didn't walk him out and didn't see him take the tray, maybe the writer should have considered the size and left some. The fact that the family of five ate it over two days shows it was a large portion. The writer might be in the wrong because even with permission, he didn't consider her need for leftovers. The girlfriend is in a bind, but the writer's assumption could have been avoided. So the answer is likely A.\n"
