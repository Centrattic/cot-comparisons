She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took his girlfriend's entire lasagna home after she said he could take some. He asked if he could take it, and she said yes. But he took the whole tray, and she ended up with nothing left for the week because she had planned on eating leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication aspect. The author asked if he could take some home, and the girlfriend said yes. But she might have expected him to take just a portion, not the whole thing. The key here is whether \"some\" implies the whole tray. However, when she said \"yes,\" she didn't specify that he should only take part of it. So, technically, he followed her permission, but maybe he misinterpreted how much she meant by \"some.\"\n\nThe next point is about the size of the tray. The author mentions it was a big tray, and his family of five ate it over two nights. The girlfriend thought the size would be obvious to take only part. But the author might not have realized that the tray was meant to last her the entire week. So, maybe there's a lack of clarity here. The girlfriend didn't make it explicit that he should only take a portion, and the author, in good faith, took the whole thing as per her permission.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is now asking him to buy a sandwich to compensate. The author feels that's unfair since he had permission, even if unintended. But maybe she's feeling deprived because she can't afford to buy more food, so she's seeking help. However, is the author responsible here? If he had known the tray was for her week's meals, maybe he would have taken less. But he didn't know, so maybe it's not his fault.\n\nI should also think about the social norms. When someone offers to take home leftovers, it's usually understood to take a reasonable amount, not the entire dish. The author might have overstepped by taking the whole tray without checking if there was enough left for the girlfriend. Even though she said \"yes,\" maybe he should have asked for clarification on how much to take.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The girlfriend made the lasagna for their date night, and after eating, she likely expected to have leftovers for the week. The author's action of taking the whole tray disrupted her plans. Even if he had permission, the size of the tray might have been a hint that it's meant to last longer. But again, unless she specified, it's ambiguous.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he did ask for permission and was given a yes. However, the amount he took was excessive, and he should have considered that taking the whole tray might leave her without food for the week. There's a balance between following permission and using common sense. So maybe he's partially at fault for not considering the implications of taking the entire tray despite knowing it was a large amount. But the girlfriend could have been clearer about her intentions. The answer might be a bit of both, but since the question is binary, the decision is between A and B.\n\nIf the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), it's because he should have known not to take the whole tray. If B (No), because he followed her permission. Given the context, the more socially acceptable view is that the author should have taken only a portion, even if he had permission. So the answer is A.\n"
