She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about taking the girlfriend's lasagna home when she said \"yes\" to taking it.\n\nFirst, when the author asked if he could take the lasagna home, she said yes. So technically, he was allowed. The problem is that she expected him to take some, not the whole tray. But he didn't clarify the quantity. She didn't specify that he should leave some for her. So maybe the misunderstanding is on both sides. But since she explicitly said yes, the author might think he had permission. However, maybe it's reasonable to assume that taking the whole tray would leave her with nothing, especially since she made it for them to eat during their date night. The tray was big, and the author ended up using it for his family of five, which might have been more than intended. \n\nThe girlfriend is now upset because she had to eat instant noodles and wants him to buy her a sandwich. The author feels she should have been clearer. But maybe there's a social norm here that when someone offers food, you don't take the entire portion unless it's obvious. Or perhaps the author should have checked if she wanted him to take the whole thing. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author did ask, and she allowed it. But maybe the size of the tray was a clue. However, the author didn't know that she needed leftovers. Since she didn't specify, maybe he isn't entirely in the wrong. But maybe he should have been more considerate. The girlfriend is being reasonable in wanting help, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for taking the food he was allowed to take. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key point is that the author asked and was given permission. The girlfriend didn't set boundaries on the quantity. So the author might not be in the wrong, but maybe both parties share some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he explicitly asked and was given the green light, even if the quantity wasn't specified, he might not be wrong. But the fact that she expected leftovers might imply that taking the whole tray was not appropriate. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the author should have known that taking the whole tray would leave her with nothing. But he didn't realize that until she mentioned the food budget. Maybe the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since she said \"yes\" to taking it home, he might not be wrong, but the girlfriend's expectations could be unrealistic. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he asked and was allowed. However, the situation highlights a miscommunication. But the question is about fault. Since he was given permission, even if the outcome was unintended, he isn't at fault. The girlfriend's expectations weren't clearly communicated, so the author isn't wrong. But maybe there's a cultural or social expectation to leave some for the host. That's tricky. \n\nIn many situations, when someone makes food for a date night, it's expected that leftovers stay for the host. But since the author was allowed to take it, maybe that's different. If she had said \"take some,\" but he took all, maybe that's an issue. But she said \"yes\" to taking it home, without specifying quantity. So the author's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
