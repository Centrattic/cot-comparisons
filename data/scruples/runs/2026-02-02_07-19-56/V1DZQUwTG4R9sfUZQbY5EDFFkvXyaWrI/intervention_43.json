She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said they could take some.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend made a big tray of lasagna for a date night. After dinner, the author asks if he can take it home for his family, and she says yes. He takes the whole tray, not just some. She didn't see him take it because she didn't walk him out. The next day, she texts him, upset that he took the whole thing and that she had planned leftovers for the week. He apologizes but argues that she didn't specify not taking the whole tray. She then asks him to buy a sandwich, which he refuses, leading to her calling him an asshole.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The author asked permission, and she gave it. The problem is that he interpreted \"take some\" as taking the whole tray, while she thought \"some\" meant a portion. The ambiguity here is on both sides. She didn't explicitly say not to take the whole thing, but maybe she assumed that \"take some\" meant a smaller amount. The size of the tray being big might have been a factor, but he might not have considered that she needed leftovers. \n\nThe author's main defense is that he asked and was given permission. However, the expectation of \"some\" vs. \"all\" is subjective. If she had specified not to take the whole tray, maybe the situation would have been different. But since he took the whole thing without considering her needs, even after she made it clear it was a big part of her food budget, he might have overstepped. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have been more explicit about her expectations. But the fact that she was upset and had to eat instant noodles because of this shows that the author's action caused a problem. Even if he had permission, taking the entire tray might have been unreasonable, especially without checking the size or her plans. \n\nSo, while both might share some responsibility, the author's action led to her financial inconvenience. He could have taken a portion and left enough for her, even if she didn't specify. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong for not considering her situation beyond just getting permission.\n"
