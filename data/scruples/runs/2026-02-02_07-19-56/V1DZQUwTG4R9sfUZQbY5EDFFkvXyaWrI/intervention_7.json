She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's go through the situation step by step. \n\nThe author and his girlfriend are in a college relationship. She made homemade lasagna for their date night, and he asked if he could take some home for his family. She said yes, and he took the entire tray. She didn't walk him out, so she didn't see him take it. The next day, she texts him about the lasagna and is upset because he took the whole thing. She mentions that she had planned to eat leftovers for the week and now she's stuck with instant noodles. The author apologizes but argues that she didn't specify he couldn't take the whole tray. She felt it was obvious given the size of the tray.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the author asked if he could take the lasagna home, and she said yes. That seems like permission was given. But the issue here is whether taking the whole tray was reasonable. The author and his family of five ate it over two nights, which suggests that the tray was indeed large. However, the author took it without considering that she might need leftovers. \n\nEven though she gave permission, the author might have assumed that \"taking some\" was implied, especially since it's common to leave some for the host when taking leftovers. The girlfriend might have expected him to take a portion rather than the entire dish. The fact that she had to eat instant noodles afterward shows that the action affected her negatively. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that he was following her explicit permission and that she didn't specify the amount. But in social norms, taking the entire dish might be seen as overstepping, regardless of permission. The girlfriend's budget planning and the resulting inconvenience add weight to her side. \n\nThe author's refusal to help her out by buying a sandwich might also be seen as insensitive, even if he feels it's her fault. Relationships often involve consideration of each other's feelings and circumstances. \n\nSo, while the author did ask for permission, the way he interpreted it might not have been thoughtful enough. The size of the tray and the girlfriend's budget constraints should have been considered. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not showing enough consideration, even if he had permission.\n"
