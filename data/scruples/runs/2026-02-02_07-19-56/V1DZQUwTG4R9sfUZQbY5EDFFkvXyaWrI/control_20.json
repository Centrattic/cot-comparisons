She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took his girlfriend's lasagna home after she said he could. She made it from scratch, and he asked if he could take it. She said yes, but didn't walk out with him, so he took the whole tray. Then later, she was upset because he took all of it, not just some, and now she's struggling with her food budget.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and clarity. The author asked if he could take it, and she said yes. But he might not have considered that \"yes\" meant taking the entire tray. The girlfriend's intention was to have leftovers for the week, but the author took the whole thing. The size of the tray is mentioned as a big one, which might have been a clue, but the author might not have realized the implications.\n\nSo, the question is, does taking the whole tray count as going beyond what was agreed upon? The author thought taking it home meant taking some, but maybe the girlfriend expected him to leave some for her. Since she didn't specify, maybe the author assumed it was okay. However, the fact that she said \"I thought you were going to take SOME\" implies that she expected a portion, not the entirety. \n\nThe author did apologize and pointed out that she didn't specify. But the girlfriend argues that the tray's size should have been a hint. The author's family of five ate it over two nights, which suggests it was a large amount. However, the author didn't know that upfront. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend didn't clarify her expectations, but the author might have been overreaching by taking the whole tray. If she said \"yes\" to taking it, maybe she meant taking a portion. The author's argument is that she didn't say he couldn't take the whole thing, but the girlfriend's reaction shows that she expected some to be left. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the implicit expectation (leaving some) was clear enough. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that the tray was meant for leftovers, even though he was given permission. Alternatively, the girlfriend could have been clearer. However, the fact that he took the entire tray when she intended to have leftovers might make him responsible for the consequences, hence why she's asking for help. \n\nThe author's refusal to buy a sandwich might be seen as not taking responsibility, even if he feels it's her fault. So, maybe he's at least partially in the wrong for not being more considerate of her situation, even if the initial permission was given.\n"
