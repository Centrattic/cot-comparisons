She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a girlfriend's homemade lasagna home. The girlfriend allowed him to take it, but he took the whole tray, and she's upset because she had planned on using the leftovers for the rest of the week.\n\nFirst, the author asked if he could take it home, and the girlfriend said yes. So he thought he had permission. The key point here is whether taking the entire tray was reasonable. The author mentioned that the tray was big and his family of five ate it over two nights. She argued that the size implied he shouldn't take it all, but the author didn't see that as obvious. \n\nDid the author overstep by taking the whole tray? Well, when someone gives permission, it's usually expected that you take a reasonable amount. But the ambiguity here is whether \"taking it home\" meant taking all of it. The girlfriend might have assumed he'd take a portion, not the entire tray. The author's defense is that she didn't specify not taking the whole thing. \n\nBut is it reasonable to take the entire meal when you're just bringing some home for your family? Maybe he should have asked how much to take. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend should have specified. However, in relationships, there's an expectation of mutual consideration. Even if he had permission, taking the whole tray left her without food for the week, which is a significant consequence. \n\nThe author is now being asked to buy her a sandwich, which he feels is unreasonable. But he might be in the wrong because he should have considered her situation. Even though he had permission, he didn't think about her needs. Maybe he should have taken some but left her with enough. So, the author might be at fault for not considering her food budget and plans. Therefore, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong). But another angle is that she didn't clarify her expectations, so maybe it's not entirely his fault. Hmm.\n\nI think the key is that the author had permission but acted in a way that caused her financial hardship. Even if the permission was given, he should have been considerate. So, AITA? Probably A.\n"
