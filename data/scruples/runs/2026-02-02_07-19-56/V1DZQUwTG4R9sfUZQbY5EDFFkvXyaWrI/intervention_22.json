She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy took his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could. He took the whole tray, and now she's upset because she needed leftovers for the rest of the week. He says she should have been clearer, but she says it was obvious he shouldn't take the whole thing because the tray was big.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked permission, which is a good point. She said yes, so technically he had permission. However, the key issue is whether taking the entire tray was reasonable. The girl intended to have leftovers, which is a common practice when making a large dish. The guy's family of five ate it over two nights, which means the tray was indeed large. The girl might have expected him to take just a portion, not the whole thing.\n\nNow, the guy's argument is that she didn't specify not taking the whole thing. But in social contexts, when someone offers to take some of a shared dish, it's generally understood that you take a reasonable amount, not all of it. The girl's intention to have leftovers implies she needed some remaining. The guy might have overstepped by taking the entire tray, even with permission. \n\nHer reaction of being upset and asking for compensation could be seen as justified because her needs were unmet. However, the guy's responsibility might be in not considering the quantity. The question is whether his actions were reasonable given the situation. The fact that the tray was big and he took the entire thing suggests he might have been in the wrong, as he should have taken only a portion, even if not explicitly told. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
