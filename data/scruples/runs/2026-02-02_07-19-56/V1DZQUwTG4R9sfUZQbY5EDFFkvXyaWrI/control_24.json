She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking the entire lasagna home when his girlfriend said he could take some. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: Both are college students. The girlfriend made a big lasagna, and the author asked if he could take some home for his family. She said yes, and he took the whole tray. She didn't see him take it because she didn't walk him out. Then, the next day, she texts him asking where the lasagna is. He explains he took the whole thing. She's upset because she wanted leftovers for the week, and now she's stuck with instant noodles. He apologized but thought she should have specified that he shouldn't take all. She argues that the size of the tray should have made it obvious not to take it all. Now she wants him to buy her a sandwich, and he's upset she's calling him an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if he could take it, and she said yes. The problem seems to be that she didn't clarify that he should only take a portion. But maybe the size of the tray could have been a clue. However, he might not have known that the entire tray was necessary for her meals for the week. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he followed the permission given. He didn't take it without asking. The issue is whether the ambiguity in her permission is his fault. But maybe he should have considered that taking the entire tray was too much, especially since his family of five ate it over two nights. That's a lot for one tray, so maybe he overstepped even though she said yes.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't specify the amount. She just said \"yes\" to taking some. So maybe the problem is that she didn't clarify her own needs. However, taking the entire tray might have been an overreaction, even with permission. The author could have taken some, saved some for her, but he took all. So he might be at fault for not considering her need for leftovers despite her permission.\n\nThen there's the aftermath. She's upset, had to eat instant noodles, and he's not willing to help. But he's also not wrong to think she should have been clearer. But maybe the responsibility is shared. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether both are at fault.\n\nIn AITA situations, sometimes the person is expected to consider the other's needs beyond just the explicit permission. Even if she said yes, taking the entire tray when it's clear it's a big tray might be going beyond what was reasonable. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he took the whole thing without considering that she needed leftovers, even if she didn't specify. So maybe A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
