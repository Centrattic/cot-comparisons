She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by taking the entire lasagna home after his girlfriend gave permission to take some. The key points here are the initial permission and the interpretation of that permission.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend asked if he could take the lasagna home, and the girlfriend said yes. So, he had explicit permission. However, the girlfriend's intention was that he would take some, not the whole tray. The author took the entire tray, which led to her not having leftovers for the week. \n\nNow, the question is about whether taking the whole tray was wrong. The author argues that since she didn't specify not to take it all, he wasn't in the wrong. The girlfriend, on the other hand, expected that taking \"some\" would be the case, and he overstepped by taking all. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone invites you to take something, especially food, it's generally expected to leave enough for the host to enjoy leftovers. The size of the tray being big might be a factor, but the key issue is the interpretation of \"take it home.\" The word \"some\" in her mind could imply a portion, not the entire dish. The author didn't clarify the quantity, which might be his oversight. \n\nEven though he had permission, he didn't consider her likely expectation of leaving leftovers. This lack of consideration could be seen as the author being in the wrong. Additionally, the girlfriend is now in a tough spot with her food budget, and the author's action directly caused that. While he apologized, expecting her to buy a sandwich might be a bit much, but the initial action of taking all the leftovers without clarification is the main issue. \n\nSo, considering the social expectations and the fact that he didn't account for her need to have leftovers, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
