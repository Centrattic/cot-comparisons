She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the girlfriend made homemade lasagna for their date night. The author asked if he could take some home for his family, and she said yes. He took the entire tray when she didn't see him leave. The next day, she texts him asking where the lasagna is, and he explains he took the whole thing. She's upset because she intended to have leftovers for the week and now she has to eat instant noodles. He apologizes but argues that she didn't specify not to take the whole tray. Now she's asking him to buy her a sandwich and called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and assumptions. The author thought taking some was okay, so he took the whole tray. But the girlfriend expected that \"taking some\" would mean just a portion, not the entire dish. The author assumed that since she said yes, taking the whole was fine. But maybe he should have asked how much she wanted him to take. He didn't consider that \"some\" might mean a small amount to him, but to her, maybe a few portions. The size of the tray was big, which might have been a clue, but he didn't think about her needing leftovers. \n\nAlso, the author's family of five ate it over two nights, which suggests it was a large amount. The girlfriend ended up having to eat instant noodles, which is inconvenient. The author's reasoning is that she didn't clarify, but in relationships, sometimes you have to be more considerate of the other person's perspective. Even if she didn't say \"don't take the whole thing,\" maybe he should have left some for her. \n\nThe girlfriend is now asking for a sandwich, which the author thinks is unfair. But he might have a responsibility to make it up, given the situation. The author's argument is that he followed her permission, but maybe he overstepped. The question is whether his action was reasonable given the context. \n\nI think the author made a mistake by taking the whole tray without considering her need for leftovers. Even though she said yes, he should have been more thoughtful about how much to take. The girlfriend's frustration is valid because she had financial plans, and his action disrupted that. So, the author is partially at fault. But is he in the wrong? Probably yes, because he didn't think through her perspective. Answer A.\n"
