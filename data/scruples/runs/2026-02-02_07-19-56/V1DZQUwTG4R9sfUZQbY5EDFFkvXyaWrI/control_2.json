She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said \"I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.\"  I felt bad and apologized but pointed out that I had asked her if I could take it home and she didn't tell me that I couldn't take the whole tray.  She said it should have been obvious that I shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  To be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but I don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that I shouldn't take it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. Today, she is asking me if I can buy her a sandwich since I took her leftovers for the week. It sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but I think this is her fault for not being clear that I shouldn't take the whole thing. I don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. She called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took his girlfriend's homemade lasagna home after she said he could. She made it for their date night, and he asked if he could take some home for his family. She agreed, and he took the whole tray. She didn't walk him out, so she didn't see him take it. Then the next day she texts him asking where the lasagna is, and he tells her he took the whole thing. She's upset because she wanted leftovers for the week and now she's stuck with instant noodles. She's asking him to buy a sandwich, and he's not willing, thinking it's her fault for not clarifying.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and expectations. The author asked if he could take it home, and she said yes. But maybe she didn't mean the entire tray? The problem is that he took the whole thing, which she didn't expect. But he thought he had permission. So, who is at fault?\n\nWell, when someone gives permission, usually the person taking the item should assume that the permission is for the entire amount unless specified otherwise. But maybe in this case, the girlfriend expected that \"some\" would be taken, not the whole tray. The author might have assumed that since she said yes, he could take the whole thing. However, the size of the tray might have been a clue. If the tray was big, maybe he should have considered that she might need leftovers. But the author points out that he didn't take the whole tray for no reason\u2014he had a family of five to feed. \n\nBut on the other hand, it's the person's responsibility to communicate their expectations clearly. If she wanted him to leave some, she should have specified. However, in relationships, sometimes people expect a certain level of consideration beyond what's explicitly stated. Even though she gave permission, maybe he should have asked how much he could take. The fact that he took the entire tray without checking could be seen as overstepping, especially when she's living alone and her budget was tight. \n\nThe girlfriend is now in a tough spot because of his actions. Even if the author thought he had permission, taking everything left her without food for the week. That seems a bit inconsiderate. But the author did ask, and she didn't say \"no\" or specify. So maybe she's partly at fault for not setting those boundaries. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when someone gives permission, the person taking the item should consider the context. The lasagna was made for their date night, and leftovers were intended for her. The author took the entire tray, knowing that she had planned to have leftovers. Even if he had permission, he might have been negligent in not considering her situation. The girlfriend's reaction of feeling betrayed and needing to ask for a sandwich is understandable because her needs were impacted. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend could have been clearer, the author might have been too literal in taking the entire tray without considering her needs. The fact that he had to explain that he took the whole tray after she had agreed, but she clearly needed leftovers, suggests that he didn't fully grasp her intention when she gave permission. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her situation despite her giving permission. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe it's B because he did ask and she didn't specify. But given the outcome, maybe A is the right choice.\n"
