Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author feels conflicted because they've had a history of rivalry and the sister has previously scheduled events conflicting with the author's important events.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's sister has a history of conflicting with her events. The first instance was the engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding. Then, the sister scheduled dress shopping on the same Saturday the author had to move, which was a busy time. Now, the bachelorette is scheduled on the author's 30th birthday. The sister justifies it by saying \"I only get married once,\" but the author feels their milestone is being overlooked.\n\nThe author is considering whether to tell their husband to make plans or just go along. They feel it's unfair because their other birthdays aren't as important as turning 30. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by possibly making up plans to avoid attending.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she's planning a once-in-a-lifetime event and wants her friends to be there. She offered to reschedule but the only alternative weekend would exclude someone else because of a horse show. The author's sister is also asking them to check with their husband, showing some consideration. The author, however, might feel that their own personal milestone is being put aside for someone else's event, especially given past conflicts.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The sister is asking for help, but the author is being asked to sacrifice their birthday. The key here is whether the author is obligated to attend. Typically, siblings don't have to prioritize each other's events unless there's a prior agreement. The sister might be overstepping by scheduling the bachelorette on the author's birthday without considering the significance. The author isn't obligated to attend if they don't want to, especially with the history of conflicts. The sister's reasoning about the horse show might be a bit of an excuse, but the author might have the right to say no. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is justified in wanting to prioritize their own milestone and the sister should have been more considerate initially.\n"
