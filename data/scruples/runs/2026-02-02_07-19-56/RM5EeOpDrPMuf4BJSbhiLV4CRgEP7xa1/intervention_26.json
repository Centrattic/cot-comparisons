Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister wanting to hold her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author feels this is being asked of them despite past issues where the sister's events conflicted with the author's important events, like the time the sister had an engagement party two weeks after the author's wedding and also scheduled dress shopping on the author's moving day.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sister has a history of scheduling her own events around the author's important events. Now, she's asking the author to give up their 30th birthday for her bachelorette party. The sister's reasoning is that she only gets married once, but the author feels this is being done at the expense of their milestone. The sister also mentions a possible alternative weekend, but it's excluded because a person who is \"non important\" (the FI's brother's girlfriend) can't attend due to a horse show. The author is conflicted about whether to go or make an excuse.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, milestones like a 30th birthday can be significant. The sister's history of conflicting events with the author's personal events (wedding, moving) adds to the tension. The sister's argument about \"only getting married once\" is common, but the author's perspective is that they've consistently had to sacrifice their own events for the sister's. \n\nThe sister is asking the author to forgo their own special day again. Even though the bachelorette is a once-in-a-lifetime event for the sister, the timing is conflicting with the author's milestone. The author might feel that the sister isn't considering their feelings, especially given past conflicts. \n\nOn the other hand, being a bridesmaid or part of the sister's wedding party usually comes with expectations of attending events. However, the sister's pattern of prioritizing her own events over the author's past events might indicate a lack of consideration. The author might be justified in wanting to prioritize their own birthday this time, especially since they don't have current plans and the sister hasn't shown prior consideration. \n\nSo, considering the repeated conflicts and the sister's apparent lack of regard for the author's milestones, the author is just trying to protect their own interests this time. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
