Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author feels that their sister has a history of prioritizing her own events over theirs, like the engagement party just before the author's wedding and scheduling dress shopping during their move. Now the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's birthday, but the only other possible weekend is conflicting with someone else's horse show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The sister is getting married, which is a once-in-a-lifetime event, so she might feel it's important to have her bachelorette party at a time that works for most people. But the author is turning 30, which is a milestone birthday. They might want to celebrate it on their own terms.\n\nThe key points here are past incidents where the sister's events interfered with the author's plans. The author mentions that the sister previously had an engagement party right before the author's wedding and scheduled dress shopping during their move. This history could contribute to the author's frustration. Now, the sister is once again asking for a favor that affects the author's personal time.\n\nThe sister offered to reschedule, but the only alternative weekend is conflicting with another person's commitment. The author feels that this person isn't important and that their own birthday is being overlooked. However, the sister is trying to find a time that works for everyone, which is understandable since coordinating a group of 10 people is tough.\n\nBut the author also mentions that they don't have current plans and that they didn't expect to have to plan so far ahead. This might be a point where the author could compromise, but given the history of conflict, they might be justified in wanting to prioritize their own milestone.\n\nOn the other hand, being a sister, maybe the author is expected to make this sacrifice, especially for a bachelorette party. However, the sister's previous actions of not respecting the author's plans could mean that the author is within their rights to say no this time.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for feeling used and are trying to set a boundary after past experiences. The sister's event is important, but so is the author's personal milestone. The fact that the sister is asking again after previous conflicts might tip the balance in the author's favor. So, I think the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
