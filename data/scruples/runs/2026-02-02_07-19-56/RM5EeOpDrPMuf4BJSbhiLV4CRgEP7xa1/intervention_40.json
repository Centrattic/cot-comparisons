Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is conflicted because of past experiences where the sister's events clashed with the author's important events.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and sister have a history of rivalry. The sister had an engagement party close to the author's wedding and then dress shopping during their moving weekend. Now the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday, which the author is reluctant about. The sister is trying to accommodate others, but the only available weekend is the author's birthday. The author is considering lying about having plans to avoid it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details. \n\nOn one hand, the sister is prioritizing her own event, which is a one-time wedding, and is trying to include her sister. The sister also mentioned the author's perspective and said she wants the author there but not to cancel existing plans. The author doesn't have current plans yet but is upset about the timing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a history of the sister encroaching on their important events. The author's 30th birthday is a personal milestone that's only once, and the author feels it's being sacrificed for someone less important (the horse show attendee). The author is considering faking plans, which might be seen as dishonest, but maybe justified given the pattern.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? The sister is trying to plan a bachelorette, which is a big event, and the author is the maid of honor, maybe? The sister might feel the author is essential. However, the author's feelings about their own birthday being overtaken by the sister's event might be valid. The sister's past actions (engagement party near wedding, dress shopping during moving) suggest a pattern of not respecting the author's priorities. \n\nBut the sister is also trying to accommodate as many people as possible. The author could choose to attend, but the question is whether not attending makes them the asshole. If the sister is making a genuine effort and the author is being selfish, then the author is wrong. But if the sister has a history of disregarding the author's needs, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the author's 30th is a personal milestone and the sister's event is a one-time wedding, both are significant. The sister's actions are more about her own event, and the author is being asked to give up their birthday. The author's resentment stems from past experiences where their own events were overshadowed. The sister's request might be reasonable, but given the history, the author's reluctance is understandable. \n\nHowever, the sister is trying to include the author and made an effort to ask and offer alternatives. The author could attend and make the best of it, but the author's feelings are valid. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend. Since the sister is prioritizing her event and the author is the one making excuses (even considering lying), the author might be in the wrong. But if the sister has a history of overstepping, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author has a right to prioritize their own milestone, especially with the sister's past behavior. The sister's event is important, but the author shouldn't have to sacrifice their own event without consideration. The sister should have tried harder or chosen a different date. The author isn't obligated to attend, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
