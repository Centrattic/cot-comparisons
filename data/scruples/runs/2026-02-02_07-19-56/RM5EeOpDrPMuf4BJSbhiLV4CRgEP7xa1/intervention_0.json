Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their sister wants to have a bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their sister have a complicated relationship. They were rivals as kids and aren't close friends now. The sister has previously scheduled events that clashed with the author's important events, like the engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding and the wedding dress shopping on the author's moving day. Now, the sister is planning the bachelorette for the author's 30th birthday weekend, and the only alternative is the end of July, but that's not possible because someone else's horse show is conflicting. The sister argues that she's only getting married once, but the author feels like their birthday is being sacrificed for someone they don't know (the fianc\u00e9's brother's girlfriend). \n\nThe author is considering whether to go or make up an excuse. They don't currently have plans, but it's 6 months out, and they're frustrated. The sister didn't consider the author's feelings and just assumed they'd be okay with rescheduling their own birthday.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The sister has a history of not respecting the author's plans (engagement party right before the wedding, dress shopping during the move). This time, the bachelorette is on the author's birthday, and the sister is being dismissive about the author's feelings. The sister's reasoning that she's only getting married once is valid, but the author's 30th birthday is a personal milestone that she might value. The sister didn't make an effort to find another weekend except the end of July, which isn't feasible for others. Also, the author was asked to reschedule their own plans, which is understandable to want to avoid. \n\nThe key points are the sister's past behavior, the author's feelings about their personal milestone, and the sister's lack of empathy here. The sister is prioritizing her event over the author's birthday, even though there are other possible times, but they say only one weekend works. However, the alternative (July) is excluded because of another person's schedule. The author might feel this is unfair, especially given past conflicts. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The sister is making personal demands that interfere with the author's personal time without considering the impact. The author has the right to prioritize their own milestone, especially since the sister has a history of not respecting their plans. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
