Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday, and the sister is asking the author to reschedule their birthday. The author is conflicted about giving up their 30th birthday for the sister's event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author mentions a history of rivalry with their sister from childhood, and while they get along now, they aren't close friends. The sister has previously scheduled events (engagement party and wedding dress shopping) during the author's wedding planning and moving period, which the author had to accept. Now, the sister is asking again, and the author is unsure if they should comply or not.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that she's getting married once, so it's important. The author feels that their 30th birthday is significant and doesn't want to miss it for someone they consider relatively unimportant (the horse show attendee). The author is considering lying about having plans to avoid attending.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess expectations and fairness. Siblings often help each other, especially with big life events like weddings. However, the sister has a history of scheduling events that conflict with the author's important events. The author's 30th birthday is a milestone, and the sister is asking to reschedule it, which could be seen as selfish. However, the sister is also in a major life event (her wedding) and might need support.\n\nBut given the previous instances where the sister didn't respect the author's plans (engagement party close to the author's wedding, dress shopping during their moving weekend), this pattern of prioritizing her own events over the author's suggests a lack of consideration. The author might feel it's unfair to keep sacrificing their time. The sister's request here is similar to past ones, and the author might be justified in not wanting to comply this time, especially since the bachelorette isn't as critical as the wedding itself.\n\nThe key point is whether the author has a right to prioritize their own milestone. Since the sister has a history of not respecting the author's plans, the author might not be in the wrong for not giving in again. However, there's a cultural expectation of family support, so some might argue the author should make an effort. But given the sister's past behavior and the author's feelings of being used, it's more about respecting personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing their own celebration.\n"
