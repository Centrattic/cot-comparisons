Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is the asshole here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, Miranda, is having a rivalry with her sister. They didn't get along as kids and even as adults, they have a bit of a competition. Miranda got engaged first, but her sister also got engaged and ended up planning events that interfered with Miranda's wedding planning and moving plans. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette party on Miranda's 30th birthday. Miranda feels like her birthday is being overshadowed again. She's considering either going or faking that her husband has plans. The sister says, \"You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\" But Miranda is frustrated because her sister has done similar things before, like the engagement party and the dress shopping conflicting with her moving.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The sister has a history of scheduling events during Miranda's important times. The current request is to use Miranda's 30th birthday for the bachelorette. Miranda is conflicted but has no current plans. The sister's reasoning is that she's getting married once, so her event is more important. However, Miranda feels her own milestone is being dismissed. \n\nNow, the question is whether Miranda is in the wrong if she decides not to attend or make excuses. The sister is using the same \"only get married once\" argument as before, which Miranda had to endure with the engagement party before her wedding. The sister's bride's maid's friend can't come if they choose the alternative date. But Miranda is the one whose birthday is being taken. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, both have important events. But the sister's events have previously conflicted with Miranda's plans. The sister might think that her wedding is a significant event, but so is a 30th birthday. Miranda's 30th is a personal milestone, and she's been asked to sacrifice it again. The sister hasn't considered Miranda's feelings this time, similar to past instances. \n\nThe sister's reasoning that the friend can't come if they choose the other date might not be a strong enough justification if it's the only weekend that works for most people. But Miranda is being asked to give up her own day. The sister's event is important, but it's also possible that the bachelorette party can be adjusted or the friend can attend another time. However, the friend is 21 and doesn't know anyone, so maybe it's a one-time conflict. \n\nMiranda is within her rights to prioritize her own birthday. She's not the asshole if she chooses not to attend. The sister's repeated prioritizing her events over Miranda's in the past might make her the one in the wrong here. Miranda's reaction is about standing up for herself this time, considering past experiences. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
