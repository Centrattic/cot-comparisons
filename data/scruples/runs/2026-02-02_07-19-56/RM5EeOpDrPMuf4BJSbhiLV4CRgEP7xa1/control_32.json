Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is conflicted because they have a history of rivalry and the sister has previously scheduled events during the author's own important times.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister has a history of planning events that conflict with the author's plans. For example, the engagement party was right before the author's wedding, and the dress shopping was scheduled during the author's moving weekend. Now, the bachelorette is on the author's 30th birthday. The sister justifies it by saying it's her only chance to be married once, but the author feels it's unfair, especially since there's an alternative date in July that doesn't work for one person.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that the author can reschedule their birthday celebration, but the author is upset because turning 30 is a significant milestone. The author doesn't have current plans but feels blindsided by the request. They're considering whether to go along or make up an excuse.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, it's common for families to prioritize weddings as major events, but so is celebrating a milestone birthday. However, the sister's pattern of overstepping seems to be an issue here. The author feels their needs are being overlooked again. The sister's bridesmaids are also involved, and the alternative date isn't feasible because of someone else's commitment. The sister's explanation about the horse show attendee not being able to come in July is a bit weak because it's a third party. \n\nThe author's feelings of being used are understandable given the past experiences. The sister's approach of asking if the author can celebrate another weekend is dismissive of the author's feelings about their own milestone. The author isn't being unreasonable for wanting to celebrate their 30th as they planned. The sister should have considered other dates without the conflict, but since the alternative isn't viable, the author's frustration is valid.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the sister is prioritizing her event, but the author has a right to their own celebration. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their special day. The sister's actions might be seen as self-centered, especially with the pattern of previous conflicts. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
