Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user is asking if the sister's request to have her bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday makes the author the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author and their sister have a history of rivalry. The sister has previously planned events during the author's wedding time, like an engagement party two weeks before the wedding and scheduling dress shopping on the author's moving day. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday, which is a significant milestone. The author is conflicted because they don't want to give up their birthday again but feels pressured by the sister's reasoning that she's only getting married once.\n\nThe sister did ask if the author had plans and offered an alternative weekend, but that alternative didn't work because of another person's schedule. The author feels it's unfair to give up their 30th, which is once in a lifetime, for someone else's event, especially since they don't have a close relationship with their sister. The author is considering making up plans to avoid attending.\n\nNow, considering the history, the sister has a pattern of prioritizing her own events over the author's. Each time, the author has complied (\"sucked it up\"), but this time it's their 30th birthday. The sister's attitude of \"you have to look at it from my perspective\" might come across as dismissive of the author's feelings. The author isn't refusing out of spite but because they value their own milestone.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is getting married and might have limited time with friends. However, the sister could have tried to find another date that works for everyone without clashing with the author's birthday. The fact that the alternative weekend is blocked because of someone else's event (a horse show) might be a valid reason, but the author is also facing a milestone.\n\nThe key points are the repeated conflicts and the author's right to their own birthday. The sister's previous actions (engagement party and dress shopping) were during the author's significant life event (wedding), which caused stress. Now, the bachelorette is during the author's 30th. The sister's justification might not outweigh the author's feelings here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is not obligated to attend if they don't want to, especially given the history. The sister's request is being made 6 months in advance, but the author hasn't made plans yet. The author can choose to be polite and decline without making up excuses. The sister's actions might be inconsiderate, given the past pattern. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author isn't the asshole.\n"
