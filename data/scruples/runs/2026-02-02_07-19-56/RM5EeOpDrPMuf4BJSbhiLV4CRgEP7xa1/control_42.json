Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, Miranda, has a sister who's been pretty self-centered about her own events. First, the sister had an engagement party two weeks before Miranda's wedding, which was a destination wedding and only included close family. Then, the sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping on the only Saturday Miranda had to move after buying a house. Now, the sister wants her bachelorette party on Miranda's 30th birthday, and the only other possible weekend clashes with someone else's horse show. Miranda is conflicted because she doesn't want to give up her 30th birthday but doesn't have plans yet.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's repeated prioritization of her own events over Miranda's, and the fact that the bachelorette is being scheduled on a significant milestone (30th birthday) without considering Miranda's feelings. The sister's justification is that she's only getting married once, but the author feels her birthday is being overlooked. \n\nI need to consider factors like the sister's history of overstepping, the importance of the 30th birthday as a personal milestone, and whether the sister's actions are reasonable. The sister did ask Miranda to reschedule, but the only alternative is inconvenient for others. The author is considering faking that her husband has plans as a way out. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, Miranda's feelings are valid. The sister seems to have a pattern of putting her needs first without regard for Miranda's. The birthday is a personal event, and while family gatherings can be important, it's not as unique as a wedding. The sister's attitude, especially with the quote about looking at it from her perspective, suggests a lack of consideration. \n\nThe question is whether Miranda is wrong to not want to give up her birthday. Since the sister has a history of this and the birthday is a personal milestone, Miranda isn't in the wrong. The sister is prioritizing her own needs without sufficient regard for Miranda's, so the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
