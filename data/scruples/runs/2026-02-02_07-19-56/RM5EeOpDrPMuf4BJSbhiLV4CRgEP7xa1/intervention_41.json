Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, let's break down the situation. The author is having a conflict with their sister over event planning. The sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is upset because the sister has previously scheduled events close to their own wedding and even during their house-moving time. Now, the sister is using the same reasoning about only getting married once to ask the author to give up their birthday.\n\nThe author feels that the sister has a history of prioritizing her own events over the author's, and now this is becoming a problem. The author is considering whether to go along with it or to make an excuse. The key points here are the history of conflicts, the sister's tendency to schedule events during the author's important times, and the author's current birthday being the only available weekend for the bachelorette.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is in her wedding planning phase and might feel that her bachelorette is important. The sister also mentioned that the author's birthday is the only weekend that works for everyone else, and she's trying to accommodate the author by offering an alternative date, though the alternative has issues because of another person's horse show. The sister also said she wants the author there and doesn't want them to cancel existing plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that their 30th birthday is significant and that the sister has a history of not respecting the author's priorities. The author is considering not attending, which could be seen as being selfish, but they also have a valid point about past conflicts. The sister's previous actions (engagement party right before the author's wedding, dress shopping during the author's moving time) might have built up this resentment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that the sister is asking for one big event on the author's birthday, and the author is feeling that their sister hasn't respected their needs in the past, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the sister is also getting married and might feel that her bachelorette is important. The key here is whether the author's birthday is a non-negotiable event that the sister should respect, despite the sister's own plans.\n\nGiven that birthdays are personal milestones, and the author has no current plans, it's understandable they want to use that time for themselves. The sister's previous behavior has created a pattern of the author having to accommodate her, so this time the author is pushing back. Since the sister is aware of the author's feelings but still chose to schedule it on the birthday, maybe the sister is in the wrong. But the author is now choosing not to attend, which could be seen as being in the wrong if they had previously gone along with the sister's events despite inconvenience.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention that the sister offered an alternative date, which is problematic. The author is choosing to prioritize their own birthday over the sister's event. Considering that the sister has a history of not respecting the author's events, the author's decision to prioritize their own might be justified. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They're standing up for themselves after past issues. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
