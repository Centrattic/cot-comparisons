Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an Asshole (AITA) because their sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the user's 30th birthday. The sister has a history of scheduling events that interfere with the user's plans. The user's sister had an engagement party just two weeks before the user's wedding, and also scheduled dress shopping on the day the user was moving. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette on the user's birthday, and the only alternative is another weekend where someone else can't attend because of a horse show.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that the user should sacrifice their birthday because she's only getting married once. The user is conflicted between going along again or making up plans to avoid it. They don't want to celebrate their birthday for the sister's event.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The user's sister has a pattern of prioritizing her own events over the user's, even when the user had significant life events. The user is now being asked again, and the sister is framing it as important. But the user feels it's unfair, especially since the sister's fianc\u00e9's girlfriend's schedule is being prioritized over the user's birthday. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister and the user have a rivalry and aren't close friends. The sister seems to take precedence in attention and planning, but the user feels their own milestone is being overlooked. The sister's past actions (engagement party before the user's wedding, dress shopping during their move) suggest a pattern of not respecting the user's plans. \n\nThe user's 30th birthday is a personal milestone. The sister is asking to use that day for her bachelorette, which is a big event. The user is being pressured to adjust their plans again. The sister's argument about only getting married once is a common justification, but it doesn't negate the user's feelings. \n\nThe user is considering whether to go or make up an excuse. They feel they have a right to their own birthday. The sister is not acknowledging the user's feelings and is prioritizing her own event, perhaps without considering the user's perspective. \n\nIn terms of fairness, siblings often help each other, but there's a balance. If the sister has consistently scheduled her events to interfere with the user's plans, it's possible the sister is inconsiderate. The user is not wrong to feel upset about this. The sister's actions seem self-centered here, especially when the alternative is available but not chosen. \n\nThe user's response of considering making up plans to avoid attending is a way to protect their own interests. The sister's insistence that the user should adjust their birthday plans, given the sister's own history of doing so to the user, suggests that the sister isn't being fair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their birthday and the sister's pattern of behavior indicates she's prioritizing her own needs without considering the impact on her sister. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
