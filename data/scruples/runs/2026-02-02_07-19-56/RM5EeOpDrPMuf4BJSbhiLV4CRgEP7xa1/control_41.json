Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (Miranda) is in the wrong for being upset that her sister is scheduling her bachelorette party on Miranda's 30th birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship dynamics. They have a somewhat contentious history as kids, now they get along but aren't close friends. There's a rivalry mentioned. So their relationship isn't super tight, which might affect how they handle this situation.\n\nLooking at the timeline: The sister has previously scheduled events that conflicted with Miranda's important events. First, an engagement party right before Miranda's wedding. Then, wedding dress shopping on the day Miranda was moving. Now, the bachelorette party is on her 30th birthday. Miranda feels like she's always having to accommodate her sister's plans, which is leading to resentment.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that she's using Miranda's birthday because it's the only weekend everyone can make it, and she emphasizes that it's just once. But Miranda points out that another weekend in July is possible, but it would exclude someone else the sister wants. Also, the sister's fianc\u00e9's girlfriend can't attend a horse show then, which Miranda thinks is trivial. The sister says it's important Miranda is there, but also says she doesn't want her to cancel existing plans. However, Miranda doesn't have any plans yet but is being asked to adjust her 30th birthday plans now.\n\nThe key points here are the recurring conflicts and the perceived imbalance in prioritization. Miranda has been accommodating before but is now at her limit. Her 30th birthday is a significant milestone, and she's feeling that her sister isn't considering her feelings. The sister's past actions have already caused inconvenience, and this is the third time. The sister's justification seems to be about her own priorities, not necessarily considering Miranda's feelings. \n\nIn relationships where there's a bit of rivalry, it's important to balance mutual respect. The sister might not realize the impact of her requests. Miranda is within her rights to want her birthday prioritized, especially after previous inconveniences. The sister's use of the horse show as a reason to exclude someone else seems trivial, which adds to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. Her concerns are valid given the history. She's not obligated to sacrifice her milestone birthday, especially when the sister has a pattern of conflicting with her plans. The answer should be B (No).\n"
