Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is conflicted because they've had a complicated relationship with their sister, and this isn't the first time the sister has clashed with their plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the history between the siblings. They had a rivalry as kids, which continued into adulthood. The sister has a history of scheduling events that interfere with the author's important events. For example, the sister had an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding, and then scheduled dress shopping on the same day the author was moving. Now, the sister is proposing the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday. The sister's justification is that she's only getting married once, but the author feels like their own milestone is being overlooked.\n\nThe author mentions that they don't have current plans for their birthday but feels it's important to plan ahead. The sister seems to be prioritizing her own event over the author's milestone. The author is considering either attending the bachelorette or making up an excuse to avoid it. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their 30th birthday for the sister's event.\n\nI should think about mutual obligations and expectations. Being a bridesmaid is a significant commitment, and while the author is the sister, they might not be obligated to sacrifice their own milestone. The sister has a history of not respecting the author's plans, which adds to the tension. The author's feelings of jealousy and rivalry also play a role here. However, the sister is trying to accommodate everyone else's schedules, which complicates things. Still, the author's 30th birthday is a personal milestone, and it's understandable they'd want to celebrate it on their own terms. The sister's approach of asking the author to reschedule their own birthday seems to prioritize her needs without considering the author's feelings. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their own birthday. The sister's actions, especially considering past behavior, don't justify overriding the author's personal milestone. The author has the right to set boundaries and prioritize their own well-being. The sister's justification about being married once doesn't negate the author's right to their own celebration. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
