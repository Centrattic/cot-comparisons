Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister and author have a complicated relationship. They fought a lot as kids and now get along but aren't close friends. The sister has a history of scheduling events during the author's wedding planning, like an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding and scheduling dress shopping on the author's only moving weekend. Now, the sister is planning the bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday, despite the author being one of the bridesmaids. The sister acknowledges the author's birthday but prioritizes her own needs, saying she only gets married once. The author feels resentful and doesn't want to give up their birthday again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. \n\nI should consider both sides. The sister is clearly using her sister's birthday for her own event, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the past history. The author, on the other hand, is feeling used and is considering lying about plans to avoid attending. However, the sister is in a position where she's planning her wedding and trying to get everyone together, and maybe the only date available is the author's birthday. But considering the pattern of the sister's actions, it seems like she's not respecting the author's personal milestones. \n\nThe key points are: past events where the sister scheduled things during the author's important times, the author's reluctance to attend again, and the sister's current request. The sister's actions seem to prioritize her own needs repeatedly without considering the impact on her sister. The author's feelings are valid given the history, and it's understandable they don't want to sacrifice their birthday again. The sister's justification about marrying once might be valid, but the repeated pattern of behavior shows a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong). The sister is the one who's repeatedly prioritizing her own events over the author's personal time, and the author is justified in feeling upset and wanting to protect their own important milestone.\n"
