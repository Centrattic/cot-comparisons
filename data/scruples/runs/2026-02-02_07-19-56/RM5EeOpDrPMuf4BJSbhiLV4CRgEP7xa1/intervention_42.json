Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about their sister planning a bachelorette party on their 30th birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation. The author and their sister have a complicated relationship. They weren't close as kids, and even as adults, they're not really friends but get along. The sister has a history of scheduling events around the author's major life events. For example, the sister had an engagement party just two weeks before the author's wedding, and then scheduled dress shopping on the day the author was moving. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday, saying it's the only weekend that works. The author is conflicted because they don't want to miss their own birthday but feel pressured to give in.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that she only gets married once, so the bachelorette is important. But the author feels that their 30th birthday is significant and doesn't want to let this person (the fianc\u00e9's brother's girlfriend) attend because she's not important to them. The author is considering lying about having plans to avoid attending.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking another opinion.\n\nI need to consider if the sister is overstepping or if the author is being unreasonable. The sister has a history of scheduling events during the author's important events. This time, it's the author's birthday. The sister did offer another weekend, but it's inconvenient because someone else can't attend. The author doesn't have current plans but feels it's unfair to have their birthday taken for someone they don't know.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of the sister's bridal party and might feel obligated. On the other hand, the sister has a history of prioritizing her own needs over the author's, and the author is justified in feeling that their birthday should be respected. The sister's actions seem to be a pattern of self-centeredness, disregarding the author's feelings and previous conflicts. The author might be within their rights to prioritize their own birthday, especially after past experiences. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
