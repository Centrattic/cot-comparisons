Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their sister wants to have a bachelorette party on their 30th birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The sister and the author have a history of rivalry. They weren't close as kids, and even now, while they get along, they aren't friends. The author is more introverted, while the sister is the life of the party. \n\nThen there's the timeline of events. The sister's engagement party was scheduled just two weeks before the author's wedding, which the author had to attend despite it clashing with their own plans. Then, the sister scheduled dress shopping on the one day the author had to move into a new house. These past instances suggest a pattern where the sister's events are encroaching on the author's important life events.\n\nNow, the current situation: the sister's bachelorette is planned for the author's 30th birthday, which the sister acknowledges is a big milestone. The sister's reasoning is that she only gets married once, but the author feels their birthday is being sacrificed for someone else's event, especially since there's another weekend suggested that would conflict with a minor detail (a horse show for a person who doesn't know anyone there). \n\nThe author is considering whether to go along or make up an excuse. They feel conflicted but don't want to spend their 30th birthday celebrating the sister. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the sister is using her own milestone (her wedding) as a reason to take over the author's milestone. The author has had to accommodate the sister before, but there's a pattern of the sister's needs being prioritized. The sister's justification seems a bit self-centered, especially since there's a possible alternative weekend, albeit with a minor conflict. \n\nThe key points here are the pattern of the sister's actions, the importance of the author's 30th birthday as a personal milestone, and the sister's apparent lack of consideration for the author's feelings. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their own celebration. They've had to give up things before, but now they're asserting their own needs. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for feeling upset, given the past experiences and the significance of their 30th birthday.\n"
