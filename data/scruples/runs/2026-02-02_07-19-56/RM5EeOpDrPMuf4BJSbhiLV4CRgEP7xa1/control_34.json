Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author's sister planning her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday, and the author is conflicted about attending.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The sister has a history of scheduling events during the author's important times. For example, she had her engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding and scheduled dress shopping on the author's moving day. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's birthday, and the only alternative is another weekend that conflicts with someone else's horse show. The author feels that their sister is prioritizing her own needs without considering the author's feelings, especially since turning 30 is a significant milestone.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that she \"only gets married once,\" which is a common sentiment in such situations. However, the author argues that their 30th birthday is a one-time event as well. The author's past experiences with the sister's conflicting events add to the tension, showing a pattern of the sister disregarding the author's plans.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister is asking for the birthday and the author is being asked to give it up, it's about mutual respect and consideration. The sister might feel she needs her sister there for her big day, but the author is within their rights to prioritize their own milestone. The sister's previous actions (engagement party right before the author's wedding, conflicting with moving plans) suggest a pattern where the sister hasn't respected the author's plans, which adds context to the current situation.\n\nThe author isn't obligated to attend, even if it's their birthday. They have a valid reason for not wanting to attend, especially given the history. The sister's offer to check with the author's husband shows she's trying to accommodate, but the author is still being asked to sacrifice their special day. The key here is the balance between family obligations and personal needs. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after past instances where the sister's priorities clashed with theirs.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author is justified in wanting to prioritize their 30th birthday, especially given the sister's history of conflicting events. The sister's insistence without considering the author's feelings is the main issue here.\n"
