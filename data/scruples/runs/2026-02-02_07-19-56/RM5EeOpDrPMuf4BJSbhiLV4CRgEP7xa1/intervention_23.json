Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is upset about this because their sister has a history of scheduling events during their own important times, like the engagement party before the author's wedding and dress shopping conflicting with their moving. \n\nFirst, the sister seems to have a pattern of prioritizing her own events over the author's plans. The author's sister had an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding, which was a destination event and only close family. Then, the sister's dress shopping was scheduled on the only Saturday the author had to move after buying a house. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday.\n\nThe author feels that their sister isn't considering their feelings and is again taking advantage. The sister's justification is that she only gets married once, which is a common argument, but it seems like she's not acknowledging the author's perspective. The author is conflicted because they don't want to hurt their sister's feelings but also feel it's unfair to give up their birthday each time.\n\nThe sister is also making exceptions for someone else (the fianc\u00e9's brother's girlfriend) because of a horse show, which the author finds trivial. This suggests that the sister isn't willing to be flexible unless it's for someone not directly related to her wedding. \n\nThe author is considering either going along with it or lying about their husband having plans. If they go, they're sacrificing their own special day again. If they lie, they're being dishonest but avoiding conflict. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author's 30th birthday is a significant milestone. The sister's actions seem to prioritize her own needs repeatedly without considering the author's. The author's resentment is justified given the history. However, the sister might argue that it's a rare event and she wants her best friend (even if they aren't close) to be there. \n\nBut the key point is that the sister hasn't shown consistency in respecting the author's plans in the past. The author is within their rights to prioritize their own celebration. The sister's approach seems self-centered, not considering the impact on the author. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stand up for themselves this time. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
