Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (Miranda) is in the wrong for being upset that her sister wants to have her bachelorette on Miranda's 30th birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has a history of scheduling her events around Miranda's major events. The first time, the sister's engagement party was two weeks before Miranda's wedding, even though the sister had promised not to do that. Then, the sister scheduled her dress shopping on the same day Miranda was moving into a new house. Now, the bachelorette is scheduled on Miranda's 30th birthday. Miranda's sister justifies it by saying she's only getting married once, but Miranda feels it's another instance of her sister not considering her needs.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of the sister encroaching on Miranda's important events, the sister's lack of consideration for Miranda's plans, and the fact that Miranda's 30th birthday is a significant milestone for her. \n\nThe sister has a poor track record of respecting Miranda's priorities. The author is not in the wrong for feeling upset, especially since this is a recurring pattern. The sister's actions seem self-centered, prioritizing her own needs without considering the impact on her sister. \n\nAlso, Miranda's 30th birthday is a personal milestone, and it's reasonable for her to want to celebrate it on her own terms. The sister's bachelorette party is a one-time event for her, but so is Miranda's 30th birthday. It's a matter of whose event takes priority, and given the history, it's understandable that Miranda would feel she's been taken advantage of.\n\nThe sister's justification doesn't hold water if there are other possible weekends, even if some people can't attend. The fact that the sister is willing to adjust the date but only to another weekend where some people might not be able to attend suggests that the sister is not fully considering Miranda's feelings. \n\nTherefore, Miranda is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
