Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author feels like their sister has done this before, like with the engagement party right before the author's wedding and dress shopping conflicting with their move. Now the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's birthday, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the history. The sister has a pattern of scheduling her events during the author's important events. The author's sister got engaged during the author's engagement and then had an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding. Then, the sister scheduled dress shopping on the day the author was moving. Now, the bachelorette is on the author's 30th birthday. The author feels this is a recurring issue and is frustrated.\n\nThe author's sister is prioritizing her own needs repeatedly, which seems inconsiderate. The author is being asked to sacrifice their own milestone birthday for the sister's event, which is a significant life event. The sister's reasoning is that she's only getting married once, but the author points out that the bachelorette could have been scheduled on another weekend, but that would conflict with someone else's horse show. The author feels that the sister isn't valuing their own birthday, which is a big deal for the author.\n\nThe author is considering telling their husband to make up plans to avoid attending. The sister did offer to not cancel existing plans, but the author didn't have any yet. The key here is whether the sister is overstepping by repeatedly prioritizing her own events over the author's important dates. \n\nThe author's resentment is justified given the past instances. The sister's actions seem to be a pattern of self-centeredness without considering the impact on the author. The author is not the asshole for wanting to prioritize their own birthday, especially after past conflicts. The sister should have made an effort to find a date that doesn't conflict with the author's personal milestones. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
