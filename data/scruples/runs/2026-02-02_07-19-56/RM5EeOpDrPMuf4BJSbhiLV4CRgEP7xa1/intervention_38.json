Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when their sister wants to have the bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister and the author have a complicated relationship. As kids, they fought a lot, and now as adults, they get along but there's still a rivalry. The sister is the more social, spotlight-seeking type, while the author prefers being behind the scenes and not the center of attention.\n\nThe sister has previously scheduled events during the author's wedding planning. First, an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding, which the author had to attend. Then, wedding dress shopping on the same Saturday the author and husband were moving, which disrupted their plans. Now, the sister is trying to schedule the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday, which is another significant personal event. The sister justifies it by saying she only gets married once, but the author feels it's unfair because their own birthday is a one-time event too. The sister also mentions another possible weekend in July, but someone might not be able to attend because of a horse show. The author is considering lying about having plans with their husband to avoid attending.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she's trying to plan her wedding events and is prioritizing her big day, which makes sense since it's a once-in-a-lifetime event. However, the author's 30th birthday is also a significant milestone. The sister has a history of scheduling things during the author's important events, which the author has had to accommodate before. Now, the author is being asked to sacrifice their own special day again. \n\nThe sister's reasoning is that the bachelorette party is important and the only weekend possible. But she also acknowledges the author's birthday and suggests another weekend, though it's not ideal. The author doesn't have current plans but feels it's their time, and they're considering making up plans to avoid attending.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both events are important. The author's 30th is a personal milestone, and the sister's wedding is a major family event. However, the sister has a pattern of prioritizing her needs in a way that conflicts with the author's. The author might feel entitled to their own celebration, especially if they've had to make sacrifices before. \n\nThe key point is whether the sister is being considerate. The author might be right to feel that their own needs are being overlooked, especially given the previous instances. The sister's statement \"I only get married once\" is a valid point, but it's also true that the author's 30th birthday is a unique event. The author's response of considering lying to avoid attending might indicate that they feel wronged here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance. The sister is asking for support, which is common in such situations, but the author's feelings are valid. The fact that the sister has a history of this might tip the scale. The author isn't refusing outright and is considering the sister's needs, but their own are being overshadowed. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to their own celebration, especially when it's a one-time event. The sister's actions, while perhaps not malicious, are inconsiderate given the prior conflicts. The author's consideration of making up plans shows they're trying to be fair, but their own needs are valid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
