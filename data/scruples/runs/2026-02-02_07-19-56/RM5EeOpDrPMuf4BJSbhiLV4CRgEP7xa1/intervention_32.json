Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the background: The sister and the author have had a competitive relationship since childhood. The sister has previously scheduled events that conflicted with the author's important events, like the engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding and the dress shopping on the day they were moving into a new house. Now, the sister is trying to schedule the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday. The sister offered an alternative weekend, but it's not ideal because someone else can't attend. The author is conflicted and feels wronged.\n\nThe author's sister argues that she's only getting married once, but the author feels that their birthday is being overshadowed. The author is considering whether to go along with it or make an excuse. The key points here are about respect, prior conflicts, and the significance of each event.\n\nThe sister has a history of prioritizing her own events over the author's, which makes the author feel used. The author's 30th is a personal milestone, and the sister's bachelorette is a once-in-a-lifetime event for her. However, the sister's past actions (engagement party right before the author's wedding, dress shopping during the move) show a pattern of not considering the author's plans. \n\nThe author might feel justified in wanting their birthday to be special, especially given the sister's previous actions. On the other hand, the sister is trying to find a time when all the bridesmaids can attend, and the author is one of them. The sister did check if the author had plans and offered an alternative, which shows some consideration.\n\nBut here's the thing: the sister has a history of not respecting the author's time and plans. The author might feel that their 30th birthday is being taken advantage of again. However, the sister is also in a position where she wants to celebrate her own important event. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by not wanting to give up their birthday again.\n\nIn terms of social norms, siblings often have to make sacrifices for each other, but there's a limit when it's a pattern of one-sided consideration. The author's sister has already done similar things before, so the author's frustration is understandable. The sister might not realize how her actions affect the author, especially given their history. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their own milestone. The sister, while in a position to want her bachelorette, might have a responsibility to consider her sister's feelings, especially after previous conflicts. The fact that the sister is asking again without considering the author's feelings could mean she's still not respecting the author's needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The sister's pattern of behavior and the author's justified frustration make the author's stance reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
