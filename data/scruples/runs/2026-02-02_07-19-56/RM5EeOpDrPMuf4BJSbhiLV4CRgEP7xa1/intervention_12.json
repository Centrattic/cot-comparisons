Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday, and the author is conflicted about giving up their birthday for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has a history of scheduling events that clash with the author's important events. The sister had an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding, and then scheduled dress shopping on the author's moving day. Now, the sister is asking to use the author's 30th birthday for the bachelorette party, even though there's a possible alternative weekend in July, but one person can't attend because of a horse show. The author feels that their 30th birthday is significant and doesn't want to give it up, especially since they have a history of the sister not respecting their event timelines.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that she's only getting married once and that the author can celebrate their birthday another time. The author is considering either going or faking that their husband has plans. The author is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to do this.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the sister's repeated scheduling conflicts, the author's feelings about their 30th birthday being important, and the sister's perspective that her wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The sister is asking for a favor, but the author has a right to their own special day. The key questions are whether the author is being unreasonable by not accommodating, or if the sister should have considered the birthday. The sister is the one who is scheduling the event, and she should have considered the author's birthday first. The author didn't have plans yet, but it's their 30th, which is often seen as a milestone. The sister is making the author feel like they have to give it up for someone else's event, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nHowever, family obligations and weddings can be complex. The sister might feel that all her bridesmaids need to be present for the bachelorette, and if that only works on the author's birthday, she might prioritize that. But the author is not the best friend; they have a rivalry. So maybe the sister shouldn't expect the same level of commitment. \n\nIn previous instances, the sister didn't stick to her promise to not have events during the author's wedding planning. Now, she's asking for another favor. The author might be justified in not wanting to give up their 30th birthday, especially after past conflicts. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The sister should have found another date or communicated better. The author has the right to prioritize their own milestone. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
