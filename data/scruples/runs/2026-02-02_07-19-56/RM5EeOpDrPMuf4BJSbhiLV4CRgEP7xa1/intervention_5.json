Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author (Miranda) is in the wrong when her sister wants to have her bachelorette party on Miranda's 30th birthday. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: Miranda and her sister have a complicated relationship. As kids, they fought a lot, and as adults, they get along but there's some rivalry and jealousy. Miranda got married in 2018, and during her wedding planning, her sister had an engagement party right before Miranda's wedding, which caused some stress. Then, when Miranda was moving after her wedding, her sister scheduled dress shopping on the same Saturday. Now, her sister wants the bachelorette on Miranda's 30th birthday weekend, and the other possible weekend would exclude someone because of a horse show.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that it's her only chance to get married, so she needs the bachelorette on that specific weekend. But Miranda feels like her birthday is being put aside for a \"non important person\" (the 21-year-old who can't attend the other weekend). Miranda is conflicted because she doesn't want to spend her 30th celebrating her sister, but she's considering lying about her husband having plans.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's think about this. The sister is asking for support in her own wedding plans, which is a significant life event. Miranda has already sacrificed by attending the engagement party and dress shopping when it conflicted with her own plans. The sister's perspective is that her wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event, so she's prioritizing it. However, Miranda is now feeling that she should have to give up her 30th birthday, which is also a personal milestone. \n\nBut the key points here are about expectations and whether Miranda is being unreasonable. The sister did say she would try to avoid conflicting with Miranda's plans, but given the circumstances, the only available weekend is Miranda's birthday. The other option would exclude someone, which the sister might not want to do. Also, Miranda mentioned she doesn't have plans yet and it's 6 months out. She could plan her birthday around this, but she's considering making up an excuse. \n\nIs it wrong for Miranda to prioritize her own birthday? On one hand, the sister is a family member and part of the wedding party, so Miranda might feel obligated. On the other, Miranda's 30th is a personal event, and it's reasonable to expect that a family member would consider her sibling's major life event. However, the sister has a history of overlapping events, which might have caused tension. \n\nThe sister's actions in scheduling the engagement party and dress shopping during Miranda's wedding planning time might have been inconsiderate. Now, the bachelorette is another instance. But the sister is trying to accommodate the group's availability. Miranda's frustration is about the perceived lack of respect for her birthday, especially as the only time she can celebrate. \n\nThe question is whether Miranda is in the wrong for not wanting to give up her 30th birthday. If the sister is prioritizing her own needs and the group's availability, and Miranda is already an adult with her own priorities, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if the sister is overstepping by assuming Miranda will adjust her birthday, then Miranda's hesitation is understandable. \n\nAlso, the part where the sister says \"you have to look at it from my perspective\" might be dismissive of Miranda's feelings. Miranda's 30th is a personal milestone, so she might not be the asshole for wanting to celebrate it on her chosen day. The sister's insistence without considering Miranda's feelings could be the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). It's reasonable to expect some consideration for a significant personal event like a 30th birthday, especially when the sister has a history of overlapping events. The sister's repeated prioritization of her own needs without fully respecting Miranda's might be the problem here.\n"
