Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) when their sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The sister and author have a complicated relationship. They had a rivalry as kids, and even as adults, they aren't close friends. The sister is more social and likes the spotlight, while the author prefers being behind the scenes. There's a history here where the sister had an engagement party right before the author's wedding, and then scheduled dress shopping during the author's move. Now, the sister wants the bachelorette on the author's birthday, and the only alternative is another weekend that conflicts with someone else's horse show. The author is conflicted because they don't want to miss their 30th but also don't want to be rude.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's see. The sister is using the \"I only get married once\" argument, which is a common one. But the author has a history of the sister not respecting their boundaries before (engagement party before the wedding, dress shopping during a move). The sister's actions seem to prioritize her own needs over the author's, even when the author had to deal with significant life events. The author's 30th birthday is a personal milestone, which is significant. The sister is asking to use that day for her event, but the author didn't have prior plans, so maybe they can adjust. However, the sister's previous behavior shows a pattern of not considering the author's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is trying to accommodate others (the boyfriend's brother's girlfriend) and the author does say that in other years they wouldn't care. But this is a milestone birthday. The sister also said she doesn't want the author to cancel existing plans, but the author doesn't have any yet. The author is considering faking plans with their husband, which might not be the best approach, but it's understandable given the history.\n\nSo, considering all this, the sister has a history of not respecting the author's boundaries, and the author is trying to protect their own important day. The sister's bachelorette is important, but the author's birthday is a personal event. The sister's actions seem to be prioritizing her own needs again, which is unfair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to not attend on their birthday.\n"
