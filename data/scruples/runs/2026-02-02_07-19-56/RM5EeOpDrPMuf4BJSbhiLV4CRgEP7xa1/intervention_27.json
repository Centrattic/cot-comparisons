Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The sister is planning her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is conflicted because of past experiences where the sister's events clashed with the author's important events, like the engagement party right before the author's wedding and the dress shopping on their moving day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the sisters. They had a competitive relationship growing up, and even as adults, they aren't close friends. The sister seems to prioritize her own events, sometimes at the author's expense. The author is feeling used, especially since the bachelorette is on their 30th birthday, which is a significant milestone.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that she only gets married once, but the author feels that their birthday is being overlooked. The sister also mentioned a non-essential person's schedule (the horse show) as a reason to stick with the current date. The author is considering either going or making up plans to avoid it.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the sister is asking for a favor, but given the history, the author might have valid reasons to prioritize their own event. However, the sister is also in a position where she's organizing a bachelorette party, which is a common practice. The author could be seen as being self-centered, but the sister's past actions might justify some resentment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The author isn't in a position where they are refusing to help out of spite, but rather because they want to celebrate their own milestone. The sister's actions have caused the author inconvenience before, so the author might be justified in wanting to set boundaries this time. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is trying to coordinate with her bridesmaids, and the author is a key part of that. If the author backs out, it might disrupt the plans. But the author's 30th is a personal event, and it's reasonable to want to celebrate it. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They have a valid right to prioritize their own event, especially after previous issues. The sister's request is coming off as self-centered, given the history. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
