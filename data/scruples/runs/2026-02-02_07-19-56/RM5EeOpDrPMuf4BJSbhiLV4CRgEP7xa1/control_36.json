Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) in this situation where their sister wants to have a bachelorette party on their 30th birthday. The author has to decide if they should give up their birthday for the sister's event.\n\nFirst, the background: The sister and author have a history of rivalry. The sister did things like having an engagement party right before the author's wedding and scheduling dress shopping during their moving day. Now, the sister is proposing the bachelorette on the author's birthday, and the only alternative is a weekend in July when a bridesmaid can't attend because of a horse show. The sister's reasoning is that she only gets married once, and she's asking the author to make a sacrifice. But the author feels it's their 30th birthday, a significant milestone, and doesn't want to spend it on the sister's bachelorette.\n\nSo, the main question here is about whether the author is wrong for not wanting to give up their birthday. Let's break down the key points. The sister's events have repeatedly clashed with the author's plans before, like the wedding and moving. The author's 30th is a personal milestone, which is a big deal for many people. The sister is prioritizing her needs again, but this time it's a major event. The author is expected to cancel or adjust their plans, even though they don't have any yet because they didn't expect something to be scheduled that far in advance on their birthday.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she only gets married once, which is a valid point. But the author's perspective is that their sister has a pattern of taking priority over them, which makes this another instance of being asked to sacrifice. The other bridesmaid being 21 and not important adds to the author's frustration, implying the sister is prioritizing someone else's availability over the author's personal time.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's understandable for the author to feel resentful. The sister's past actions have already caused inconvenience, and now the author is being asked to do the same again. The birthday is a personal event, and while the sister might not be intentionally being selfish, the pattern suggests it. The author isn't required to attend the bachelorette, and if they don't have existing plans, they can still make new ones. However, if they choose to make up a reason not to go, is that wrong? The sister did say she wants the author to be there and not to cancel existing plans, but the author didn't have any. \n\nI think the sister is overstepping here, especially given the history. The author's 30th birthday is a one-time event too, and it's reasonable to expect that the sister would try to find another weekend. The fact that the only alternative is a horse show for one of the bridesmaids, who is 21 and not well-known, might not be a strong enough reason to prioritize her over the author's milestone. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their special day, and the sister's pattern of behavior makes this situation more about the sister's needs than the author's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
