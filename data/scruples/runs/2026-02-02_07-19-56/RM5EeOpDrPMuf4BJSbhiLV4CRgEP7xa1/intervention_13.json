Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is conflicted because of past experiences where the sister seemed to prioritize her own events over the author's, like the engagement party right before the author's wedding and scheduling dress shopping during the author's move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the siblings. They have a complicated relationship with a history of rivalry and jealousy. The sister is more outgoing and attention-seeking, while the author prefers being behind the scenes. The sister has previously made choices that inconvenienced the author, so the author's resentment is understandable.\n\nNow, the main issue is the bachelorette party on the author's 30th. The sister is asking the author to give up her birthday to attend. The author feels that this is the sister not respecting her significant milestone. The sister justifies it by saying she only gets married once, but the author feels that the bachelorette party could have been scheduled on another weekend if needed, like the end of July, even though one person might not be able to come. The author is conflicted about whether to attend or fake plans to avoid it.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, maybe she's trying to include her sister despite the history, but she might not be considering the author's feelings enough. However, the author's past grievances are valid. The sister's previous actions have caused inconvenience, and this request seems to add to that. The author's 30th birthday is a personal milestone, and the sister is choosing her event over that. \n\nBut the sister is also in a position where she wants to have her bachelorette with all her friends. However, the author feels that the sister is prioritizing her event over the author's own important day. The sister's justification about the one-time marriage might not outweigh the author's feelings about her birthday. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister is asking for a favor, but the author has the right to prioritize her own time. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect her 30th birthday. The sister should have considered the author's feelings and perhaps found a different date, even if it meant someone else couldn't attend. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable here. She's standing up for her own needs after a history of being put last. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
