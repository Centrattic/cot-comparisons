Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details provided. The sister has a history of conflicting with the author's events. The author's wedding was a destination event, then the sister had an engagement party two weeks before the wedding. The author had to move and handle that, then later, the sister scheduled a dress shopping event during the author's move. Now, the latest is the bachelorette on the author's 30th birthday. The sister asked if the author could move their birthday celebration, but the alternative weekend doesn't work because some people can't attend. The author is considering either attending the bachelorette or faking plans to avoid it.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're the asshole here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is getting married and wants her bachelorette party. She's tried to accommodate the author's situation before, but the author has had to adjust plans multiple times. The sister is asking for one weekend, which is a significant event. The author might feel that their 30th is important and that they've already compromised before.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister has a history of prioritizing her own events over the author's, leading to repeated conflicts. The author's 30th birthday is a milestone, and the sister is choosing the same date without considering the author's feelings. The sister's reasoning is that she's only getting married once, but the author has had to adjust multiple times already. The author might feel that their own milestone is being overlooked again.\n\nThe key here is the pattern of behavior. If the sister has consistently taken precedence over the author's plans, it's understandable the author is frustrated. The sister's request seems to be another instance of putting her needs first without considering the author's feelings. The author isn't refusing to attend out of spite but because they've been repeatedly sidelined. The sister's justification about the horse show for someone else seems trivial compared to the author's 30th. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the sister is in the wrong for not considering the author's feelings again. The author is within their rights to prioritize their own birthday, especially after previous adjustments. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
