Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister wants her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is feeling like this is a pattern of the sister taking over and not considering her feelings. \n\nFirst, let me look at the history. The sister had an engagement party right before the author's wedding, which was a destination wedding and she had to explain things. Then, the sister scheduled dress shopping on the only weekend they had to move after buying a house. Now, the bachelorette is on the author's birthday. The sister is being very self-centered here, as she's prioritizing her own events over the author's personal milestone. \n\nThe author mentions that their relationship has always been a bit competitive, but now they're adults. The sister made a promise not to let her planning interfere with the author's wedding but didn't keep it. This current situation seems like another instance where the sister isn't respecting the author's time and feelings. \n\nThe author is conflicted because she wants to maintain a good relationship but is hurt by the repeated prioritization of the sister's events. The sister's reasoning is \"I only get married once,\" which seems dismissive of the author's feelings about her own birthday. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, especially since the sister has a history of not considering her in the past.\n\nThe other bridesmaids aren't close to the author, and the person causing the scheduling conflict is someone the author doesn't know. The sister is making the author choose between her birthday and the bachelorette, which is unfair. The author is not obligated to give up her birthday, especially when the sister has a history of similar behavior. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the sister is prioritizing her own needs repeatedly without consideration, and the author has every right to want to celebrate her own milestone.\n"
