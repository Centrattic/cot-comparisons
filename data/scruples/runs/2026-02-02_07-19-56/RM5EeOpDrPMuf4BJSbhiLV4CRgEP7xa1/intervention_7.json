Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister wanting to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author has had a history of tension with her sister, including past events where the sister's wedding plans conflicted with the author's own wedding and house closing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the siblings. The author mentions a rivalry and that they aren't close friends, just get along when together. The sister has been known to prioritize her own events over the author's, like the engagement party right before the author's wedding. Then the sister scheduled dress shopping on the author's moving day. Now, the sister is asking to use the author's 30th birthday for the bachelorette, which the author sees as another conflict.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that the bachelorette party is important and the only weekend everyone can attend. The author is upset because it's her 30th birthday, which is a significant milestone, and she doesn't want to miss it for someone she isn't very close to. The sister also mentioned that the author's husband has a schedule, but the author hasn't confirmed his plans yet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister is asking for a favor, but the author is within her rights to prioritize her own birthday. The sister's previous actions (engagement party during the author's wedding planning, dress shopping during the move) show a pattern of self-centeredness. The author's feelings of jealousy and being the center of attention are valid given the history. The sister's insistence on her own needs without considering the author's feelings might be the real issue here. \n\nThe key points are: the sister's event is only when it conflicts with the author's personal milestones, the author isn't in a close friendship with her sister, and the sister's justification seems to prioritize her own needs over the author's. The author is not obligated to give up her birthday, especially if they aren't friends. Choosing to make up a reason to decline isn't necessarily wrong if it's to protect her own interests. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
