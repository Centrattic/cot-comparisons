Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this AITA scenario. The sister is planning her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author has a history of their sister being the center of attention and causing conflicts, like the engagement party during the author's wedding planning and dress shopping during their moving week.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's reasonable for the author to not want to give up their 30th birthday. The sister's justification is that she only gets married once and doesn't want to miss the opportunity to have her bridesmaids present. But the author feels it's another instance of their sister prioritizing her own needs over the author's significant life event. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of not respecting the author's plans. The author is being asked to reschedule their own birthday, which is a personal milestone. The sister is the one in the spotlight, and the author prefers being behind the scenes. The sister's bridesmaids are also part of this, but one of them is her fianc\u00e9's brother's girlfriend, who's 21 and doesn't know anyone. The author is being asked to skip their 30th to accommodate this person's schedule. \n\nThe sister did offer an alternative weekend in July, but it conflicts with the horse show of this other person. The author is left with two options: either go to the bachelorette on their birthday or find a way to make excuses. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, birthdays are important personal events. While weddings are also significant, the sister has already shown a pattern of prioritizing her events over the author's. The author's 30th is a once-in-a-lifetime event too, though maybe not as formal as a wedding. The sister's reasoning seems to be that her event is more important, but the author is clearly not comfortable with that. \n\nThe author doesn't currently have plans, but the sister is choosing a date that's personally significant to the author. The sister's approach of asking if the author has plans and suggesting moving them could be seen as manipulative, using the \"you have to look at it from my perspective\" angle. \n\nThe key points are the sister's history of overshadowing the author's events, the personal significance of turning 30, and the fact that the bachelorette could be rescheduled to another weekend if the sister was more flexible. Since the sister is the one who wants to have the party during the author's birthday, but the author is being pressured to give up their own milestone, the responsibility lies more on the sister. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their own birthday, even if they have to make an excuse to do so.\n"
