Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the sister in the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister wants to have her bachelorette party on the author's 30th birthday. The author is feeling like she's being asked to sacrifice her birthday for her sister's event. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's sister is getting married and wants to have a bachelorette party. They mentioned that the only available weekend for all the 10 people (except the author) is the author's 30th birthday. The sister even called and asked if the author could celebrate her birthday another time, emphasizing that she's only getting married once. The author feels this is unfair, especially since they have a somewhat competitive relationship and past incidents where the sister's events clashed with the author's important events (like the engagement party right before the author's wedding and the wedding dress shopping during the author's house move).\n\nThe author is now being asked again to adjust her plans for the sister's event. The author is conflicted because she doesn't want to spend her 30th birthday on her sister's bachelorette, but she's considering whether it's her responsibility as a sister to go. The sister is also using the excuse that a specific person can't attend if they move the bachelorette to another date.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. Let's break it down. The key points here are the sister's repeated scheduling conflicts with the author's important life events. The first time, the sister had an engagement party two weeks before the author's wedding. Then, the dress shopping was scheduled during the author's house move. Now, the bachelorette is on the author's birthday. It seems like a pattern here of the sister not respecting the author's plans or boundaries, even after previous conflicts. \n\nThe sister's justification is that it's her only chance to get married and that the other person (the fianc\u00e9's brother's girlfriend) can't attend if moved. But the author's 30th birthday is a significant milestone. The sister is prioritizing her needs over the author's, which might be seen as selfish. However, family obligations can be complex. But given the history, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The sister is asking for the third time to adjust the author's plans, which could indicate a lack of consideration. \n\nAlso, the sister is being asked to choose between her event and the author's birthday. The author isn't making plans yet, but it's 6 months out. The sister is pushing to schedule on a specific date without considering the author's feelings. The author's reaction is understandable. However, the sister might not realize the extent of the author's feelings, especially given their past interactions. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if the sister is making a genuine effort to include the author and is sorry for the inconvenience, maybe the author should go. But given the history and the sister's previous disregard for the author's events, the author might have a right to feel used. The sister's actions could be seen as self-centered, using the author's birthday as a convenient date without considering the impact. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to prioritize her own special day, especially after past conflicts. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
