Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. As kids we fought constantly and now as adults we get along, even have a good time when together, but are by no means friends. We\u2019ve always had a bit of a rivalry. \n\nWe are different people, my sister and I. She\u2019s the athletic social butterfly with tons of friends and also wanting the spotlight. I have 3 or 4 good friends and I like to be behind the scenes. And even though I like not being the center of attention, I\u2019m human. With it always came a bit of jealousy. \n\nI became engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years in December 2016 with plans to marry in 2018. 7 months later in the midst of my planning she also became engaged. To her boyfriend of a year. She promised none of her planning would take place during mine. I wish I could say she held true to that. She was engaged for a year when she announced that she was throwing an engagement party with our entire family. \n\nTwo weeks before my wedding. \n\nFor context, my wedding was a destination, and only parents and siblings were invited. None of the rest of the family. But I sucked it up and went. Had the same conversation with everyone, \u2018Yep getting married in two weeks, no sorry we couldn\u2019t invite everyone, yes we plan to have a party when we get back, etc.\u2019 \n\nWe got married, everything was great. Came home and stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to buy a house. The closing took a month and we took one week to move (working during the week). My sister scheduled her wedding dress shopping with all her bridesmaids for the only Saturday my husband and I had to move. Sucked it up, went to that, killed myself moving everything on Sunday. \n\nNow the final straw and where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Her wedding is September 7th. Her bridesmaids are currently trying to plan her bachelorette for the summer. Somehow the only weekend all 10 people (except me) can make it is my 30th birthday. \n\nShe called me yesterday and asked if I had plans for my birthday and if I could celebrate it another weekend. She said and I quote, \u2018You have to look at it from my perspective Miranda, I only get married once.\u2019 \n\nThe only other weekend that could possibly work would be the end of July but then her Fiancee\u2019s brothers girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to make it because she has a horse show. She is 21 and knows nobody. So I\u2019ve been asked to skip the one time I turn 30 so that some non important person can go to a horse show. \n\nShe did say that it\u2019s important I\u2019m there and she doesn\u2019t want me to cancel plans I might already have. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have plans for my birthday. But it\u2019s 6 months out and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to plan that far ahead. Not to mention I didn\u2019t think my sister would even dare to try and schedule something that could be any weekend on it. Any other birthday i wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nI told her I\u2019d ask my husband to make sure he hasn\u2019t planned anything. So I have a choice here. I can suck it up go or I can make up that my husband has made plans. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my 30th birthday celebrating her. AITA? \n\nTL;DR- My sister has asked me to give up my 30th birthday to have her bachelorette. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author, Miranda, is turning 30 and her sister wants to have her bachelorette party on that weekend. Miranda has a history of tension with her sister, including past conflicts over events like engagement parties and wedding dress shopping. Now, the sister is trying to schedule the bachelorette during Miranda's birthday, and the only alternative is a weekend in July where someone else (the fianc\u00e9's brother's girlfriend) can't attend because of a horse show. Miranda is conflicted because she doesn't want to celebrate her birthday for her sister, but she's also hesitant to say no.\n\nFirst, let's look at the sister's perspective. She has a big event (her wedding) coming up in September and wants to have a bachelorette party when everyone can attend. The bride often feels that their big day is a once-in-a-lifetime event, so she's prioritizing that. She even asked Miranda if she could reschedule her birthday, which shows she's aware of the conflict and is trying to be considerate. The sister's reasoning is that she only gets married once, which is a valid point for many people. The bride is also saying it's important that Miranda is there and not to cancel existing plans, which suggests she's trying to be accommodating.\n\nOn the other hand, Miranda is feeling that her 30th birthday is being overshadowed. She's already had to adjust her plans multiple times for her sister's events in the past, like the engagement party right before her wedding and the dress shopping during her moving weekend. Turning 30 is a significant milestone for many people, and Miranda might feel that this time should be special for her. She doesn't have current plans, but she's frustrated that her sister is assuming she can push her birthday aside again.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics between the sisters. They've had a competitive relationship since childhood, with Miranda being more introverted and her sister more outgoing and spotlight-seeking. Miranda might feel that her sister has taken up a lot of her time and attention in the past, and now she's reaching her limit. However, the sister is trying to be respectful by asking if Miranda can reschedule her birthday and by acknowledging the importance of both events.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The sister has made efforts to check with Miranda and find a solution. Miranda, on the other hand, might be feeling resentful due to past experiences. But is that enough to say she's in the wrong? Well, the sister is not forcing Miranda to attend; she's giving her the choice. Miranda has the option to say no, but she's hesitating because of past grievances. However, the sister is prioritizing her own big event, which is understandable. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider the significance of each event. Weddings often require a lot of planning and family involvement, and the bachelorette party is part of that. Miranda's 30th birthday is a personal milestone, but perhaps not as pressing as her sister's wedding. That said, everyone's priorities can differ. The sister's willingness to offer an alternative date (even if it's less than ideal) shows she's trying to find a middle ground. \n\nSo, is Miranda in the wrong for wanting to prioritize her birthday over her sister's event? It depends on perspective. If the sister had planned the bachelorette without consulting Miranda, that would be different. But she did reach out and offer alternatives. Miranda's decision to consider making up an excuse might be a way to protect her own interests, but it could also strain the relationship. However, given the history of the sisters not being close and the sister's previous inconsiderate actions, Miranda's reluctance is understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, neither is entirely in the wrong. The sister is trying to accommodate, but her actions in the past might have made Miranda feel overlooked. The key is communication and mutual understanding. But since the question is whether Miranda is in the wrong, I think the answer leans more towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's justified in wanting to prioritize her own milestone, especially given the history. However, if the sister had no alternatives and couldn't find another date, it's a different story. But here, there is an alternative, even if it's less than perfect. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to use her birthday as is.\n"
