I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see the situation. The user is 17 and wanted to switch from the depo shot to the Nexplanon implant. Their mom told them to wait until they turn 18, which is three months away. The user went ahead and got the implant without telling the mom. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, the user's age is a factor. At 17, they're still a minor in most places, so their parents might have some say in medical decisions, especially if the parent is the one paying for the healthcare or if there's a legal guardian involved. But in some places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, like reproductive health services, without parental consent. So maybe the user had the legal right to make this decision.\n\nThe mom's reaction seems to be about not wanting them to make the decision now, possibly because she wanted to discuss it more or do her own research. The user argues that waiting three months would have made little difference, especially since the implant is more permanent. The user is not sexually active, so maybe the mom is concerned about the permanence of the implant, even if it's reversible. Also, the user mentions they are working part-time now but will be working full-time after 18, so the timing of the procedure might affect their work. The mom, who has an IUD herself, might not understand the user's reasoning.\n\nLegally, if the user can consent on their own for this procedure, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the parent was supposed to be involved and the user went against that, maybe they are in the wrong. However, the user felt that the mom wasn't engaging in the discussion and just told them to wait. The user might feel that their autonomy is important, especially regarding their own body and health. The mom's overreaction could be a sign of not respecting the user's choice, but the user also didn't communicate their decision until after the fact, which could have been handled better.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the user made a decision that affects their own body, possibly with legal consent, but didn't inform their mom, leading to conflict. The mom wanted to discuss and do her own research but the user proceeded without waiting. The user's reasoning is valid, but the lack of communication is a problem. The answer might depend on the legal context and the relationship dynamics. If the user had the legal right to consent, then they are not in the wrong. If not, maybe they are. However, since the user is 17 and the parent is upset, but the user is not in the wrong because they have the right to make their own health decisions once they can consent. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
