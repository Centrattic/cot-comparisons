I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, so a minor. They had a depo shot before but wanted the implant, which requires a longer commitment. They mentioned it to their mom, who said to wait until 18. The author then went ahead and got it without telling her, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nLegally, the mom is the parent, so she might have authority over medical decisions for a minor. But in some places, minors can consent to certain medical procedures, especially related to reproductive health. I'm not sure about the exact laws here, but that's a factor.\n\nThe author argues that they're responsible, not sexually active, and wanted a long-term solution. They also point out that their mom uses an IUD, implying her own choice. The mom is upset about the lack of communication and wants to research, possibly feeling disrespected.\n\nEthically, it's a balance between parental authority and the minor's autonomy. The author might feel mature enough to make their own decisions, but the mom might not trust them yet. The situation is complicated by the mom's reaction\u2014hanging up, then being upset later.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to make this decision without parental consent? If the law allows it, then the author isn't in the wrong. If not, maybe they are. But even if they are legally allowed, the parent's feelings are important. The author might be seen as acting responsibly, but also as not respecting their parent's wishes. \n\nThe mom's overreaction could be part of the issue. She might be projecting her own anxiety or not understanding the long-term benefits. The author's reason for getting it sooner (work plans) is valid, but the mom might not see that. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, community often considers intentions and context. The author's intent was to make a responsible choice, while the mom's intent is to protect. But since the author is a minor, there's tension. However, if the author is legally able to consent, the answer might lean towards B. But if not, maybe A. But since the exact legal status isn't given, it's tricky. \n\nAlso, the author isn't sexually active, which removes some pressure regarding immediate need. But wanting long-term planning is still valid. The mom's inconsistency (using an IUD) might make her reaction seem hypocritical. \n\nOverall, considering the author's maturity and intent, but also the parent's authority, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A because of not involving the parent. However, the parent also didn't engage in discussion. The situation is nuanced, but leaning towards B.\n"
