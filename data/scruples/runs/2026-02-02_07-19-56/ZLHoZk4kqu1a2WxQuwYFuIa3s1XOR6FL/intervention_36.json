I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. Her mom initially said to wait until she's 18, but the user proceeded anyway. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, the age factor: the user is 17, under 18 (the age of majority in many places). In most states, minors can consent to their own medical care for reproductive health, so legally, she might be allowed to make this decision. But the question is about right and wrong, not just legality.\n\nThe mom's perspective: She wanted her daughter to wait until 18, maybe to discuss further or feel more mature. The user didn't wait, which could be seen as going against her mom's wishes. The mom is upset because she feels her advice was ignored. Even if the user is right about the medical decision, not communicating could hurt the relationship.\n\nThe user's reasoning: She thought it was more convenient, not sexually active, and wanted to get it done before work. She might feel her mom is overreacting, especially since the mom uses an IUD herself. But the mom's concern might be about her daughter making a long-term decision impulsively.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's a mix. Legally, she might not be, but ethically, not discussing with her mom could be seen as disrespectful. The mom's reaction is strong, but the user also had valid reasons. Maybe it's a gray area. The user made a mature decision but didn't consider her mom's feelings. So maybe she's partly in the wrong, but the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the user is an adult in some states but under 18, and the mom's reaction is about autonomy, the answer might be A because she didn't respect her mom's wishes. But if the law allows it, maybe B. Hmm. The user is in the wrong for not communicating, but not for the medical decision. So answer A.\n"
