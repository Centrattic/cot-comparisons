I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 17-year-old got a Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom had previously told them to wait until they were 18, but the person went ahead and got it done anyway. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can make their own medical decisions regarding contraception without parental consent. So maybe the person had the right to do it. But then again, some states do require parental involvement for certain procedures. But the user mentions that the clinic could do it for them, so maybe they were allowed to. \n\nThe mom is upset, possibly because she felt her authority was undermined. She wanted the child to wait until 18, maybe because she thought the child wasn't mature enough or wanted to discuss it further. But the child has valid reasons\u2014like convenience, future work plans, and the implant being more effective. Also, the child mentions they're not sexually active, so maybe the mom's concerns are about that as well. \n\nThe mom has an IUD herself, so there's a bit of inconsistency there. The child might be confused why the mom is so against it when she uses a similar method. The child might feel that their autonomy is being dismissed. \n\nBut the child didn't tell the mom, which could be seen as a lack of communication. Maybe the mom wanted to be involved in the decision-making process, even if she disagreed. The child's reasoning is understandable, but the act of not informing the mom might be seen as disrespectful. However, if the mom was dismissive when the child brought it up (just saying to wait until 18 without discussion), the child might feel that communication wasn't possible. \n\nSo the question is whether the child's actions were wrong. If the child is legally allowed to make this decision, then maybe not. But if the mom was expecting to be part of the process and the child went against that, maybe there's a fault. It's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental wishes. Since the child is a minor, parents usually have some authority, but minors also have rights over their bodies, especially in medical decisions. \n\nIn some cases, getting an implant without parental consent might be legally permissible. Therefore, the person might not be in the wrong. But if the mom felt betrayed because they didn't communicate, there's a social aspect to consider. However, the child's reasoning seems valid, and the mom's reaction might be over the top given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
