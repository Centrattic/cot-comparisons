I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The situation is that the author is 17 and had previously discussed switching birth control with their mom, who told them to wait until they turn 18. The author then went ahead and got the implant without their mom's consent, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical aspects. In many places, minors can consent to their own medical care, especially regarding reproductive health. So legally, the author might have the right to make this decision. However, the mom might still be upset because they discussed it earlier and she asked them to wait. The author's reasoning is that they wanted a more convenient method and that getting it now allows for healing before starting a job that requires physical labor.\n\nThe mom's reaction could be based on concern, even if she has an IUD herself. Maybe she's worried about the procedure's risks, even if they're similar to the Depo shot. Also, the author is not sexually active, which might be a point in their favor since the need for birth control isn't urgent. But the mom might still want to be involved in the decision-making process, even if she's being dismissive or overreacting.\n\nEthically, it's a balance between the minor's autonomy and the parent's right to be involved. If the author is capable of understanding the medical procedures and their consequences, they might be justified in making the decision. However, going against the parent's explicit instruction (\"wait until 18\") could be seen as disrespectful or a breach of trust, even if the parent's reasons were not fully explained.\n\nThe author also mentions that the mom hung up the phone and later said she was upset. The parent might feel that the author didn't respect her wishes. On the other hand, the author felt dismissed when the mom didn't engage in the conversation about why they wanted the implant. So there's a communication breakdown on both sides.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is acting in their own health care, which is a significant aspect of autonomy. However, the parent's concern might stem from wanting to protect their child, even if the approach was flawed. Since the author is close to turning 18 and the decision affects their future (healing before a job), there's a valid reasoning there.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author was wrong in not following the mom's instruction to wait. If the mom had a legitimate reason (like needing to be present, or having different medical advice), then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the mom just changed her mind without valid reasons, the author's decision could be justified.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the answer hinges on the balance between the minor's autonomy and parental oversight. In many cases, especially in medical decisions where the minor is capable, they might have the right to proceed. However, the parent's initial instruction was to wait, so not respecting that could be seen as the author's fault. But the parent's refusal to discuss the reasons complicates things. The author might be in the right for seeking the procedure if they're legally able to consent, but the way they went about it without discussing it could be seen as wrong. So maybe split, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong if they have the legal right and made a reasoned decision for their own health. But given the parent's explicit instruction to wait, there's a case for the author being in the wrong. Hmm, tough call. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is making an autonomous health decision, but there's a nuance where the parent's wishes weren't respected. However, since the author is close to 18 and the procedure is long-term, the decision might be justified. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
