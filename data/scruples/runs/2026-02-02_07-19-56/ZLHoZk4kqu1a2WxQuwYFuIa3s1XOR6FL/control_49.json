I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom, who had previously said to wait until they turn 18. The mom is upset, even though the child isn't sexually active and the decision seems medically sound.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: In many places, minors can consent to certain medical procedures, especially related to reproductive health. So the author might have the right to make this decision independently. But laws vary by location, so that's a factor.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom wanted to discuss it further, maybe do research. The daughter went ahead without her, leading to the mom being upset. Even if the daughter is legally allowed, the emotional impact on the mom matters. The daughter might have acted without considering her mom's feelings, which could strain their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is old enough to understand her healthcare needs and made a decision based on convenience and future plans. Since she's not sexually active, the immediate health risks are lower. The mom's reaction might be overprotective, especially since she uses an IUD herself, indicating she's aware of long-term methods.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the daughter respected her mom's wishes. The mom had asked her to wait and wanted to discuss it, which the daughter ignored. Even if the daughter felt it was the right choice, not communicating could be seen as disrespectful. However, given the daughter's autonomy in medical decisions, maybe it's her right.\n\nI'm leaning towards the daughter being in the right (B) because she made a decision regarding her own body and health, which is a personal choice. However, the relationship aspect complicates it. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about relationship damage. Legally and ethically, the daughter might not be wrong. So answer B.\n"
