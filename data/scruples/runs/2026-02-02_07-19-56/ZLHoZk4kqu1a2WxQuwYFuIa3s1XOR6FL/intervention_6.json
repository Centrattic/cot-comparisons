I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. The author is 17, got the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge, and the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. For example, in the US, some states allow minors to consent to birth control. If that's the case here, the author might have the legal right to make this decision. But I'm not sure about the specific state laws, so maybe that's a factor.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom initially told the author to wait until 18, and the author went ahead without consulting her again. The mom might value open communication and mutual decision-making, especially regarding health. Even if the author is legally allowed to make the choice, not discussing it further could have been a breach of trust. The mom's reaction, like hanging up, shows she's really upset. \n\nThe author argues that the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom uses an IUD herself. But maybe the mom has different concerns\u2014like potential side effects or the permanence of the implant. The author mentions that the side effects are similar to Depo, but maybe the mom feels the implant is more invasive. Also, the mom might be worried about the author's ability to handle the procedure at 17, maybe because of work commitments or other factors.\n\nAnother point is that the author is not sexually active, which the mom knows. So the mom might think the decision isn't urgent. The author wanted convenience, but maybe the mom thought waiting was better. However, the author had a valid reason for wanting the implant now, given their work plans after 18. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't explain their reasoning properly and went ahead, which might have been disrespectful to the mom's initial request. Even if the author is right about the choice, the way they handled it could have been better. \n\nSo, considering legal rights versus relationship dynamics, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, not discussing the decision could be seen as wrong. The answer might depend on whether the law supports the author's action, but the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in terms of responsibility. If the mom had a right to be involved, maybe the author is at fault. But if the author could legally decide, then they're not. \n\nI'm a bit torn. If the author had the right to make the decision independently, then they're not wrong. If they should have respected the mom's initial request to wait, then they are. Since the mom initially said to wait, but the author proceeded, even if legally allowed, maybe it was a mistake to not communicate better. But maybe the author felt their autonomy was important. \n\nHmm. I think the answer could be either A or B, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) if they had the legal right, but A if they should have respected the mom's wishes. Since the situation doesn't specify the legal aspect, but the author might have acted on their own right, but the method of handling it was poor. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong but could have handled it better. However, the question is if they are in the wrong. Given the mom's reaction and the lack of communication, maybe the author is partially at fault. But if the author had the right to consent, then they're not. I'm not sure. I'll go with A or B based on the typical AITA factors. Since the author made a decision without considering the parent's input, even if legally allowed, the social expectation might be that they should have discussed it. So maybe A.\n"
