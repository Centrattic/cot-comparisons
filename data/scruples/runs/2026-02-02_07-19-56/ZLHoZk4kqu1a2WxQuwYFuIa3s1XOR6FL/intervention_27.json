I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is 17 and decided to switch their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom initially told them to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The author went ahead and got the implant done, and the mom got upset, hung up, and later was still upset. The mom is asking about side effects and wants to research, even though she has her own IUD. The author argues that they're not sexually active, it's more convenient, and the mom is overreacting.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, minors can make decisions about their own healthcare without parental consent, especially regarding reproductive health. So the author might have the legal right to do this. But then there's the relationship and trust aspect. The mom wanted them to wait until 18, which could be a parent trying to maintain some control or maybe due to their own beliefs. The author went behind their back, which might have hurt the mom's feelings or made her feel disrespected. \n\nThe mom's reaction was to hang up and then be upset later. The author might have acted out of independence, but did they consider how their mom would feel? Even if the mom is being overbearing, the author could have tried to communicate better, maybe explained their reasons more thoroughly or found a compromise. They chose to act without discussing it further, which could be seen as dismissive of the mom's concerns, even if those concerns seem irrational.\n\nHowever, the author is making a decision about their own body, which is a valid point. The mom has her own IUD, so it's a bit confusing why she's against the implant. The author's reasoning about convenience and future work plans is practical. Still, the method of switching without discussing it more might have been a misstep. Maybe the author should have tried to convince the mom, provided more information, or waited until they turned 18 to avoid conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mom was unwilling to engage in a discussion (as she just said to wait without explaining), the author might feel that they have the autonomy to make their own medical decisions. The fact that they're not sexually active is another point\u2014maybe the mom is worried about other implications, but the author isn't. \n\nSo, the key factors are legality (if allowed), the parent's right to have input, and the child's autonomy. The author's actions might be legally okay, but ethically, it's a gray area. If the mom wanted to be involved, the author could have been more transparent. However, if the mom was being unreasonable and not listening, the author might feel justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often weigh the balance between personal autonomy and respecting parental wishes. Since the author is a minor, there's an expectation that parents have some authority, but minors also have rights. The answer depends on cultural context and specific laws, but generally, acting without parental consent when they've expressed a clear preference might be seen as wrong, even if the action itself is legal. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting their mom's wishes and the relationship dynamics, even if the medical decision is valid.\n"
