I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually presents a situation where someone is seeking validation or criticism for their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, including birth control, without parental permission. So if the girl is of age to consent on her own, then she's within her rights. But the situation depends on local laws, which the user didn't specify. However, since she got it done without her mom knowing, maybe she's in a jurisdiction where she can consent independently.\n\nNext, the mom's reaction. The mom initially told her to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The daughter felt that waiting would complicate things when she starts working full-time. The mom then seems upset about the decision, questioning the side effects, even though she has an IUD herself. The daughter isn't sexually active, which adds a layer because the mom might be worried about unintended consequences, but the daughter's decision is based on convenience and future plans.\n\nEthically, minors often have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies, especially regarding reproductive health. However, parents usually expect to be involved in significant medical decisions. The daughter didn't lie about the procedure\u2014she just went ahead without informing her mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust despite her having the legal right to make the choice.\n\nThe mom's overreaction might stem from feeling disrespected or concerned about possible risks. But the daughter's reasoning seems valid. The question is whether acting without parental knowledge is wrong, regardless of the legality. Some might argue that despite the legal right, the daughter should have discussed it more with her mom, especially since the mom had expressed concerns.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and context. The daughter's intent was to make a proactive choice for her future, not to deceive. However, not involving her mom could lead to conflict. The mom's reaction of hanging up and later being upset indicates that the way the daughter handled it hurt the relationship.\n\nSo, balancing legal rights and familial relationships: the daughter might be justified in her decision legally, but in terms of relationship dynamics, she might be at fault for not handling the communication better. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and how much autonomy is expected in such decisions. Since the daughter had the right to consent and the procedure is for her benefit, some might say she's not in the wrong. However, others might see her action as disrespectful to her mom's wishes even if the mom was being dismissive.\n"
