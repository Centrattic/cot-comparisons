I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is 17, and she had been planning to switch from the Depo shot to the implant, which lasts five years. She had discussed it with her mom, but her mom told her to wait until she turns 18. The author went ahead and got the implant without her mom's approval, and now her mom is upset. The author is 17, which is under the age of majority in most places, so legally, her mom might have some say in medical decisions. However, the situation is about autonomy versus parental control.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age. At 17, the author is an adolescent, and depending on the state or country, parental consent might be required for certain medical procedures. However, some places allow minors to consent to certain medical treatments, like birth control. If that's the case here, then the author might have a right to make this decision on her own. But if parental consent is required, then maybe the author was wrong to not inform her mom.\n\nNext, the mom's perspective. The mom asked her to wait until 18 and didn't engage in a discussion. The author felt that her mom wasn't listening to her reasons, such as the convenience and the fact that she's not sexually active. The mom is upset about the side effects and the timing, but the author points out that the side effects are similar to the Depo shot. The mom has an IUD herself, which complicates the situation\u2014why is she okay with her own choice but not her daughter's?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she wanted a long-term solution now, before she starts working full-time, which could make the healing process harder. She's also not sexually active, so maybe the mom is overestimating the risk. The author might feel that her autonomy is important, especially if she's capable of making informed decisions.\n\nBut then, the author didn't communicate properly. She went ahead without telling her mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the mom was dismissive, the author could have tried to find another way to get her mom to understand or involved another trusted adult if necessary.\n\nLegally, if parental consent is required, the author might be in the wrong. But if she can consent on her own, then maybe not. Also, the mom's reaction might be over the top, but the author's approach of not discussing it further could be seen as disrespectful. There's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental involvement, especially when the child is a minor.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if she had the legal right to consent. However, her approach of not communicating with her mom could be problematic. The mom's reaction is also questionable given that she has her own IUD. The answer might depend on the legal context, but based on the info given, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both sides.\n"
