I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a 17-year-old who switched their birth control without telling their mom. The mom had initially told them to wait until they turned 18, but the author went ahead and got the implant anyway. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 17, the author is a minor, so in many places, they might need parental consent for medical procedures. But some places allow minors to consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. I'm not sure about the exact laws here, but that's something to consider. If the author didn't need consent, maybe they had the right to make the choice. But if they did need consent, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The mom had asked them to wait until 18 and not discuss it further. The author went against that request, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author thinks the mom is overreacting, the fact that they didn't communicate or respect the mom's initial wishes might make them at fault. The mom's reaction could be about control or concern for their child's health, even if the author isn't sexually active. The mom might feel that she's losing influence over important decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a health decision that affects them. They might feel that their autonomy is important, especially since they're approaching adulthood. The fact that the mom has an IUD herself could make her reaction seem inconsistent. The author's reasoning about convenience and future work plans also seems valid. However, the method of going behind the mom's back and the resulting conflict might be where the issue lies.\n\nIt's a balance between the author's right to make medical decisions and respecting their parent's wishes. If the author had a legal right to make the decision, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they broke a trust or didn't consider the mom's concerns, then they might be. The mom's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe she's being overbearing, but the author's actions could have been handled better by communicating or finding a compromise.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author being at fault because they went against their mom's explicit request without discussion. Even if they had the legal right, the trust between parent and child is important. But if legally they could do it, maybe the fault isn't entirely on them. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their mom's wishes despite the option to discuss further. However, the mom's overreaction is also valid. But in terms of right vs. wrong, the author didn't follow the mom's initial boundary, so they might be at fault.\n"
