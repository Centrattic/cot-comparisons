I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and got a Nexplanon implant without their mom's approval. The mom wanted them to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The daughter decided to go ahead, thinking it's more convenient and considering her future work plans. The mom is upset, even though she uses an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In the US, minors can sometimes consent to certain medical treatments, especially for reproductive health. So the daughter might have the legal right to get the implant without her mom's consent. That's a point in her favor.\n\nThen there's the relationship issue. The mom felt excluded and might have wanted to be involved in the decision. The daughter didn't respect her mom's wishes initially, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the mom didn't engage in a meaningful discussion when the daughter brought it up, just told her to wait until 18. The daughter felt she had valid reasons to act now, considering her future work situation.\n\nThe daughter isn't sexually active, so the mom's concerns might be more about control rather than health or safety. The daughter's argument that the mom is overreacting is valid given the mom's own use of an IUD. But the daughter's decision to proceed without discussing further might have hurt the mom's feelings.\n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? It depends on the context. Legally, she might not be. Emotionally, she might have disregarded her mom's feelings. But the mom's reaction seems inconsistent with her own choices. The daughter had valid reasons to act now. Considering all that, the answer is probably not in her wrong. So, answer B.\n"
