I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who decided to switch their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom initially said to wait until the user turns 18, but the user went ahead and got the implant done. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, the user is a minor, so their parent has legal authority over their medical decisions. Even though the user is 17 and might be seen as mature, the age of majority is 18 in most places. So legally, the mom might have had the right to make decisions until the user turns 18 unless there's emancipation or specific exceptions for reproductive health. Some places allow minors to consent to certain medical treatments without parental consent, especially for reproductive health services. If that's the case, maybe the user had the right to proceed. But the answer depends on local laws.\n\nEmotionally, the mom is upset. She might feel like her authority is being challenged. Even if the user isn't sexually active, the mom might be worried about potential future risks or side effects. The user mentioned that the side effects are similar to Depo, but maybe the mom is concerned about the long-term nature of Nexplanon. The user's reasoning about convenience and work plans is valid, but the mom might not see the urgency.\n\nCommunication is a key issue here. The user didn't explain their reasons fully and went ahead without discussing. Even if the user has the right to make the decision, the lack of communication could be seen as disrespectful. The mom might feel disrespected or worried that her advice was ignored. On the other hand, the user might feel that their autonomy is important, especially if they're responsible and have researched the options.\n\nThe user is not sexually active now, so maybe the mom's concern isn't about immediate risks but about future ones. The user's mature reasoning could be a point in their favor. However, the parent's role is to protect and guide, so there's a balance between autonomy and parental oversight.\n\nConsidering all factors, if the user had the legal right to consent, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they didn't, then they might be. Since the question is about being in the wrong in terms of the situation rather than the law, maybe the user's action is seen as wrong because they didn't communicate properly with their mom. The mom had given a clear instruction to wait, and the user acted against that. Even if the decision is legal, the relationship aspect is important. So the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and respect for the parent's wishes, even if the decision itself is valid.\n"
