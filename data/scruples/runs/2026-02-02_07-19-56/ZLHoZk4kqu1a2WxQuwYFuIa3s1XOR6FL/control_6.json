I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge. Their mom wanted them to wait until 18, but they went ahead and got the implant done. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author is allowed to make this decision without parental consent. But laws vary by location, so that's a factor.\n\nThen there's the aspect of parental authority. The mom might feel she has the right to be involved in her child's healthcare decisions until they're 18. The daughter, however, argues she's mature enough to make this choice, especially since she's not sexually active and wants a long-term solution. She also mentions her mom has an IUD herself, which is a point she's using to question her mom's reasoning.\n\nCommunication is another key point. The author approached the mom about the implant, but the mom dismissed the conversation and told her to wait. The daughter then made the decision without further discussion. The mom reacted strongly, which the daughter feels is overreacting. The daughter's reasons for acting now\u2014like not working full-time and needing recovery time\u2014are valid considerations.\n\nEthically, it's a balance between a child's autonomy and a parent's right to guide their child's health decisions. Since the daughter is close to 18 and can legally consent, maybe she's justified in asserting her independence. Also, the mom's reaction of hanging up and being upset seems harsh, especially since the daughter's choice isn't risky and aligns with her future plans.\n\nBut some might argue that the daughter didn't give her mom a chance to understand her reasons better. The mom wanted to research more, and the daughter acted before that. However, the daughter might see this as unnecessary given her own maturity and the similarity in side effects with the Depo shot.\n\nConsidering all factors, the daughter's actions seem reasonable. She made an informed choice, considering her circumstances, and in many places, she legally could have done so. The mom's reaction, while understandable from a parental concern standpoint, might be seen as overreacting given the daughter's maturity and the non-risky nature of the decision. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
