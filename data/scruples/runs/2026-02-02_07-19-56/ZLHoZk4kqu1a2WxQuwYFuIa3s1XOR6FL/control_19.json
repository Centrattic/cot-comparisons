I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a 17-year-old got the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom had asked them to wait until they turned 18, but the author went ahead and got the procedure done. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. For example, in some states in the US, teens can get birth control without parental consent. So maybe the author has the right to make this decision on their own. But laws vary by location. The question is whether the author was legally allowed to make this choice without parental approval.\n\nNext, the relationship aspect. The mom might feel that since the author is still a minor, she should have a say in major decisions affecting her health. Even if the author is of legal age to consent, the mom might feel that communication and mutual agreement are important. The author didn't consult with the mom after she initially said to wait, which might have caused the mom to feel disrespected or unheard.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted convenience and that getting it now, while they aren't working full-time, makes sense. The mom, however, is upset and wants to research more. The author might feel they are capable of making informed decisions, but the mom's concerns about side effects are valid. Both have different perspectives on what's best.\n\nAlso, the mom has an IUD herself, which suggests she might be familiar with implants. So her overreaction might stem from other factors, like not wanting her child to undergo the procedure or feeling that the decision should wait.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between the author's autonomy and the parent's right to be involved. If the law allows the author to consent, then legally they're not wrong. But ethically, not discussing it after the initial refusal might be seen as dismissive of the parent's wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if the author was legally allowed to get the implant without consent, then they aren't in the wrong. However, if the parent had a valid say in the decision (depending on local laws), then maybe the author should have waited. But given that the author is 17, many places would allow them to consent to birth control. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer might be B, No.\n"
