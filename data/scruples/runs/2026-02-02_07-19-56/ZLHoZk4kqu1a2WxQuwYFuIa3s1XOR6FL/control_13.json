I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 17-year-old got the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom had previously told them to wait until 18, and when they went ahead without her, the mom was upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, minors can consent to certain medical treatments without parental consent, especially those related to reproductive health. So maybe the author isn't breaking any laws here. But the question is more about whether they're in the wrong in a moral or social context.\n\nThe author wanted the implant for convenience and mentioned that they're not sexually active. They did bring it up with their mom before, but the mom refused to discuss it and said to wait until 18. The author felt that waiting until 18 would be harder because they'll be working more. The mom's reaction was to be upset and mention side effects, even though she has an IUD herself. \n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. The author is a minor, but they made a medical decision without parental approval. However, they might have the legal right to do so. The mom might feel disrespected or that her authority is being ignored. On the other hand, the author could argue they're making a decision for their own health and future. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and the parent's perspective. Some parents might see this as overstepping, while others might support the child's autonomy. The author's reasoning about convenience and work plans is valid, but the method of getting the implant without discussing it further could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe author didn't mention if there was any prior agreement or understanding about making medical decisions. If the mom had set a boundary (wait until 18), then going against that could be seen as breaking trust. However, the author might feel that their autonomy is more important, especially in a medical context where they can consent. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, they might be okay. Morally, it depends on the parent-child relationship and how much autonomy is expected. Since the author had already discussed it and the mom refused to talk about the reasons, maybe the author felt justified. But not informing the mom after could hurt the relationship. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to make their own medical decisions, but some might argue they should have respected the mom's initial request. However, the mom's refusal to discuss and set an arbitrary age might make the author's action understandable. So I think B.\n"
