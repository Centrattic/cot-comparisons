I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, and the mom had told them to wait until they turn 18. The author got the implant done without the mom's consent. The mom was upset and hung up, then later mentioned being upset again. The author argues that they're responsible for their own body and that the mom is overreacting. They also mention that they're not sexually active, so maybe the mom's concern is about future protection. \n\nIn some places, minors can make medical decisions about contraception without parental consent, especially for birth control. But laws vary by location. If the author is of age to make this decision legally, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the mom was paying for it or there's a legal requirement for consent, that could be a factor. \n\nThe author's reasoning for acting now includes not being able to work full-time later, which makes sense. The mom's reaction might stem from wanting to be involved in her child's healthcare decisions. Even if the law allows the author to make this choice, there's a social and familial expectation of communication. The author might be right in asserting their autonomy, but maybe should have discussed it more with their mom regardless. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom did refuse to talk about the reasons, so the author might feel they had to act. The side effects argument is a bit unclear\u2014since both methods have similar side effects, the mom's concern there might be unfounded. \n\nSo, legally, maybe the author is okay. But in terms of family dynamics, maybe not communicating could be seen as a mistake. The answer might depend on cultural or legal context not provided here. Since the question is about being in the wrong in general, not just legally, the author might be at fault for not involving their mom, even if they can legally make the decision. Or they might not be, if the mom was being dismissive. It's a tough call.\n"
