I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (a 17-year-old) is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The situation involves medical decisions, parental consent, and the teenager's autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, minors under 18 can make their own decisions regarding reproductive health without parental consent. This is often part of laws protecting minors' access to confidential healthcare services. So legally, the author might have the right to make this choice.\n\nNext, the mom's reaction. She wanted the daughter to wait until 18 and didn't engage in a discussion. The daughter felt dismissed and decided to act to avoid potential future issues (like working full-time). The mom's upset reaction might stem from feeling disrespected or worried about the daughter's health, even if she's not sexually active. However, the daughter's reasoning for acting now seems practical.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between parental authority and a teenager's growing autonomy. The daughter is taking control of her reproductive health, which is a significant aspect of personal agency. The mom's insistence on waiting could be about wanting to maintain control or having her own concerns, but the daughter's decision might be seen as responsible and proactive.\n\nThe mom's history with an IUD might indicate she's aware of the implant's effects, which could add to the confusion about her objection. The daughter's non-sexual activity removes some of the typical concerns parents might have, focusing instead on the method's suitability.\n\nHowever, the daughter didn't communicate her decision to the mom, which might have been a point of contention. But since the law allows minors to make this decision, the daughter's action might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally and ethically, the daughter's decision is protected. The mom's reaction might be overprotective, but the daughter acted within her rights. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
