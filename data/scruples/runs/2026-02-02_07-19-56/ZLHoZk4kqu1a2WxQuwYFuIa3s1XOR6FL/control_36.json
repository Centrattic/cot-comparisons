I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from the depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom had previously said to wait until the daughter turns 18, which is three months away. The daughter got the implant done without her mom's consent, and now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can make decisions about their reproductive health without parental consent, especially for birth control. So maybe the daughter is within her rights here. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong morally or socially, not just legally.\n\nThe daughter is 17, almost 18, and the mom is being dismissive, telling her to wait without explaining why. The daughter felt that waiting until 18 wouldn't change much, especially since she's not sexually active and just wants a more convenient method. The mom is upset about the decision, even though she has an IUD herself, which might indicate she's aware of long-term methods but is being stricter with her daughter.\n\nThe daughter's reasoning includes convenience and practicality, like not working full-time now. The mom's reaction seems to be about control or fear, maybe not trusting her daughter's judgment. The daughter argues that she's making a responsible choice for her own health and future.\n\nSo, is the daughter wrong? If the law allows her to make the decision, then legally no. Morally, it's about autonomy versus parental authority. Since the daughter is almost an adult, making decisions about her body is a key aspect of autonomy. The mom's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is capable and informed. The daughter didn't lie about being sexually active, which might be a point in her favor if the mom's concern was about that. Since she's not active, the mom's concern seems misplaced. \n\nHowever, the daughter didn't communicate her decision to her mom, which could be seen as a lack of respect. But if the mom was dismissive and didn't listen, maybe the daughter felt justified in taking matters into her own hands. \n\nConsidering all factors, the daughter might not be in the wrong, especially if she's making a responsible choice and the mom's objections are based on control rather than valid health concerns. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
