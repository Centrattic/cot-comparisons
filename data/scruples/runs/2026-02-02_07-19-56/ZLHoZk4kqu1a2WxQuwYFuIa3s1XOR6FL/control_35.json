I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old who switched their birth control method without telling their mom. The mom had initially said to wait until they turn 18, and when the author went ahead and got the implant without her, she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author had the legal right to make this decision without parental consent. But that depends on the specific laws where they live. The question doesn't specify the country, but assuming it's a place like the US, some states do allow minors to consent to contraceptive services. So legally, the author might be in the right.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The mom was upset and hung up the phone. The author argues they're not sexually active and wanted something more convenient. The mom, who has an IUD herself, seems inconsistent. But maybe she's worried about potential side effects or the author's autonomy. The author didn't consult her, which could be seen as disrespectful, even if they're legally allowed to make the choice. On the other hand, the author felt the mom was overreacting and wasn't providing a valid reason to wait.\n\nThe author's reasoning: they wanted to get the implant before starting a job that involves physical labor, so healing wouldn't be an issue. The mom is now upset, but the author isn't sure why she thinks they can't make this choice. Since the author is in a medical situation where they can consent, maybe they're justified. But the mom might feel that they should have discussed it more, especially since the author is still a minor.\n\nHowever, in many cases, especially regarding healthcare decisions, minors are allowed to make their own choices. The mom's reaction could be based on concern, but the author is acting in their own medical best interest. The fact that the author is not sexually active might also be a point in their favor, as it's about long-term planning regardless of current activity.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and communication. The author made the decision without any discussion, leading to the mom hanging up. Maybe the author could have approached the conversation differently, like researching the side effects themselves and presenting the information to the mom to ease her concerns. However, if the mom was being dismissive and not open to discussion, the author might feel they had no choice but to proceed.\n\nIn summary, legally the author might be in the right, but there's a conflict in the parent-child relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not consulting more. If the law allows their decision, then they aren't in the wrong. If the mom's concerns are valid but the author didn't address them, maybe they could have handled it better. But since the author is making a personal health decision they're legally allowed to make, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
