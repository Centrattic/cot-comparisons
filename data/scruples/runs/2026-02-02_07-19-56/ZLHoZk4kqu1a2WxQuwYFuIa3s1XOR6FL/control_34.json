I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is a 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom had said to wait until they turn 18, but the kid went ahead anyway. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 17, the person is a minor, so their parents have certain rights. But in some places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. I'm not sure about the exact laws here, but maybe the parent's consent was not required if it's considered a minor's right to make their own reproductive decisions. However, the mom was present in the conversation and initially told them to wait until 18, then the kid went ahead without her. So maybe she was supposed to be involved in the decision.\n\nThen there's the ethical part. The parent might feel that since the child is a minor, they should have a say in major medical decisions. The parent might be worried about the long-term effects or the permanence of the implant, even though the child is not sexually active. The parent might also have their own reasons for not wanting the procedure now, like waiting until the child is more independent. On the other hand, the child might feel it's their body and their choice, especially since the procedure is long-term and they wanted to avoid having to get shots every three months. The child might also be right in thinking that waiting until 18 could lead to other issues, like work commitments affecting recovery.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems strong\u2014hanging up, being upset. The child might not have considered how this decision would make their mom feel, even if they thought it was the right choice. The parent might feel disrespected or undermined. The child could have tried to communicate better, maybe insisted on discussing it more or at least informed the mom after the fact. But on the other hand, the mom didn't engage in a dialogue beyond saying to wait, which might leave the child feeling they needed to take action to get their needs met.\n\nAlso, the fact that the parent has an IUD herself could be a point. If she uses a similar method, why is she so against her daughter's choice? That might suggest it's not the method itself but the timing or the child making the decision without her. The child might be right in thinking the parent is overreacting, but maybe there's an underlying reason the parent didn't want them to get it now.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, maybe the kid is allowed to make the decision if the law permits it. Ethically, the child could be seen as taking initiative for their own health, but maybe should have communicated better with the parent. The parent could be seen as overstepping by not discussing it, but the child's action might be seen as undermining the parent's authority.\n\nGiven all that, the answer might depend on the specific laws and the family dynamics. Since the question is AITA, the community might lean towards the parent being overreacting, but the kid might still be in the wrong for not involving the parent. However, if the law allows the child to make the decision without parent consent, then the kid might be justified. But without knowing the specific laws, it's hard to say. The parent's reaction could be seen as valid from her perspective, even if the kid is acting in their own interest. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the kid made a decision about their own body, but the parent's reaction is also understandable. Alternatively, A if the kid should have waited for the parent's agreement. But I think the majority view would be B because it's the kid's body and they are seeking long-term health management, even if they could have communicated better. The parent's refusal to discuss and just saying to wait might not be enough to make the kid wrong for acting independently.\n"
