When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is 17 years old. They were using the depo shot every three months but wanted to switch to Nexplanon, which lasts five years. They asked their mom, who said to wait until they turn 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. Then the person went ahead and got the implant without their mom's knowledge. The mom was upset, hung up, and later said she was upset, asking about side effects. The person argues that the mom is overreacting, especially since she has an IUD herself and the person isn't sexually active now but wants something more convenient.\n\nSo, the key points here are: age (17), parental control, medical decision-making rights, and the mom's reaction. In many places, minors can make their own medical decisions regarding contraception without parental consent, especially for birth control. However, there might be variations depending on local laws. But since the person got the implant without the mom's consent, even if they're legally allowed to do so, the question is about whether they were wrong in the context of their relationship with their mom.\n\nThe person might feel it's their right to make decisions about their body, especially if they're responsible enough to manage their own care. However, the mom might see it as a lack of respect for her guidance and the boundaries she set. The person's argument is that the mom's reaction is over the top, given that the side effects are similar and the person isn't even sexually active. The mom might be worried about the permanence or the procedure itself, even though the person is prepared for it.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, if the person can consent to medical procedures, they might be in the right. But in terms of family dynamics and communication, maybe they should have discussed it more. However, the mom didn't engage in a conversation when initially asked, so the person might feel they had no choice. The fact that the person is responsible and the mom didn't provide a valid reason to wait could tip the scales. Also, the mom's actions (hanging up, being upset) might indicate that her reaction is more about control than the actual decision. Considering all that, I think the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because they made a decision that's in their best interest, especially if they have the capacity to consent. So the answer would be B.\n"
