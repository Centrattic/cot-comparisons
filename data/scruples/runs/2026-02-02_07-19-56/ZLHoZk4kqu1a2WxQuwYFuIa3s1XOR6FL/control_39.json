I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old switching their birth control to Nexplanon without telling their mom, even though the mom had said to wait until they turned 18. The author got the implant without the mom's consent, and the mom was upset. The author argues that they're not sexually active, it's for long-term convenience, and the mom has an IUD herself. They also mention that the mom's reasoning for waiting until 18 isn't clear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So the author might have the legal right to make this decision. Then there's the ethical side. The mom wanted them to wait until 18, but the author felt it was better to get it now. The author might value autonomy, while the mom might be concerned about the decision's risks or the child's ability to handle it at 17.\n\nThe mom's reaction is a key point. She hung up and later said she forgot about it. The author argues the mom is overreacting, especially since she has her own birth control method. The difference between 17 and 18 might not be significant in terms of the decision's validity, but the mom might see 18 as a more responsible age. However, the author has valid reasons, like work plans affecting recovery time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't communicate their decision, which could lead to the mom feeling disrespected. Even if the author has the right to make the decision, not discussing it could strain the relationship. The mom's concern about side effects might be genuine, but the author points out they're similar to the depo shot.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if they have the legal right and it's their body, but maybe there's a communication issue. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were legally permissible and whether they handled the situation with respect to their mom's concerns. If the law allows it, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the mom's consent was required and the author went against that, it's a different story. But in many places, minors can consent to birth control. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance in the communication aspect. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the communication. Since the author acted within their rights, maybe the answer is B.\n"
