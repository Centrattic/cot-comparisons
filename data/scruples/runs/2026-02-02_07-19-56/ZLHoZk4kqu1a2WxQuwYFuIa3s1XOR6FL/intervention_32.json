I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is 17 and wanted to switch from the depo shot to the nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom wanted the kid to wait until 18 and didn't discuss their reasons. The kid went ahead and got the implant without the mom's consent, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, minors can consent to their own healthcare, especially for reproductive health. So maybe the kid was within their rights. But the mom might still feel violated because they didn't ask. But the kid is 17, almost 18, so maybe they're trying to be independent.\n\nThe mom's reaction could be based on concern. She might think the kid is too young to make such a decision, even if they're responsible. The fact that the kid is not sexually active might add to the mom's worry about unnecessary procedures. Also, the mom has her own birth control (IUD), so maybe she's trying to control the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid is making a decision that affects their own body. They had a valid reason to want a longer-term option, especially considering future work. The mom's refusal without discussion could be seen as dismissive. The kid might feel their autonomy is important here.\n\nBut the kid did go ahead without telling, even though the mom had expressed a preference. So there's a breach of trust. Even if the kid is right about the decision, the way they did it (without discussing) could be wrong. The mom might have valid concerns about side effects or the timing. Also, the kid is 17, so maybe the mom feels a duty to guide them until they're 18.\n\nBut if the kid can consent legally, maybe the mom's reaction is more about control. The key points are autonomy vs. parental authority. Depending on the laws and the relationship dynamics, the answer might vary. But in terms of right or wrong, the kid acted without consent, which is a breach of trust, but the mom's overreaction is also possible. It's a tough balance.\n"
