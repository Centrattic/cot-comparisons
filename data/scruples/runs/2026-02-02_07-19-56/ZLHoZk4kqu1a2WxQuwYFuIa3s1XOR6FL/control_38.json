I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting the Nexplanon implant without informing their mom. The author is 17, got the implant without their mom's consent, and the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can make their own medical decisions regarding contraception without parental consent. But laws vary by location, so maybe that's a factor here. However, the question is more about moral or relational responsibility, not legal.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom initially told the author to wait until 18, and the author went ahead anyway. The mother felt it was a decision that required her input. Even if the author is legally allowed to make the choice, the mother might feel that the author didn't respect her authority or concerns. The author mentions the mother has an IUD, so it's perplexing why she's against it, but that doesn't mean the mother's feelings are invalid.\n\nThe author's reasoning: convenience, not being sexually active, and wanting a long-term solution. The mom is upset about the side effects and possibly other factors. The author didn't involve the mom, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author thinks the mom is overreacting, the act of making a significant medical decision without consulting the parent might be seen as wrong in the context of their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a teenager seeking autonomy. The mom didn't provide a clear reason to wait, just told them to do so. The author might feel their own body and future planning should be their choice. But respect for parental input is often part of the dynamic in such situations.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's a balance between autonomy and respect. The author made a decision without discussing, which could be seen as wrong if the mom expected a conversation. But if the mom's reasons were unclear and the author acted in their best interest, maybe not. The answer might hinge on cultural, familial expectations, and the specific context not mentioned. However, generally, making a decision without considering the parent's perspective might be seen as wrong in the AITA context, where maintaining family harmony is valued. Hence, the answer could be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the author's actions are legally and medically sound and they have valid reasons, maybe B. But given the AITA nature, the community often looks at whether the person acted respectfully. Since the author didn't involve the mom, even if legally okay, they might be wrong in the situation. So I think the answer is A.\n"
