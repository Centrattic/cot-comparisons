I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. The author is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge, even though their mom had told them to wait until they turn 18. The mom is upset about it, and the author is defending their decision by saying they're not sexually active and wanted something more convenient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age factor. The author is a minor, so legally, they might need parental consent for medical procedures. But in some places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. However, the mom might still expect to be involved in such decisions, especially if she's the one handling medical appointments.\n\nThe mom's perspective is important here. She initially told the daughter to wait until 18 and then got upset when she went ahead without permission. The daughter took action without discussing it further, which could be seen as disregarding her mother's wishes. Even if the daughter has her own reasons, like convenience and future work plans, the mom might feel that she should have been part of the decision-making process.\n\nThe daughter's argument that she's not sexually active and the mom has an IUD herself might not necessarily justify the decision. The mom's concerns about research and side effects could stem from a place of wanting to ensure her daughter is fully informed. However, the mom did seem dismissive initially by not engaging in the discussion, which complicates things.\n\nI also need to think about the legal aspect. In some jurisdictions, minors can consent to certain medical procedures without parental consent, but this varies. If the daughter is 17 and the procedure is legal for her to consent to, then she's within her rights. However, if the mom is the legal guardian and the procedure requires consent, the daughter might have acted without proper permission.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's autonomy and right to make personal health decisions could be a factor. At 17, she's close to adulthood and might feel capable of making her own decisions. The mom's reaction could be seen as overprotective, especially since the daughter isn't sexually active and has valid reasons for choosing the implant.\n\nBut the key point is that the mom had already expressed her stance\u2014telling the daughter to wait until 18. By going ahead without discussing further, the daughter might have violated her mom's trust and expectations, even if the action was legally permissible. The daughter could have handled it differently by trying to persuade her mom again or finding a compromise, but instead chose to act unilaterally.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the daughter's actions might be legally okay depending on local laws, but ethically, she could be seen as in the wrong for not respecting her mom's wishes and the family dynamics. However, if the law allows minors to consent, then the daughter isn't in the wrong legally. The answer depends on whether the focus is on legal rights or familial expectations.\n"
