I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to get the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge. The mom had previously told them to wait until they're 18, and now she's upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So getting birth control without a parent's consent might be legally permissible. But the user is 17, so close to 18, and the mom is a legal guardian. However, the user is seeking autonomy here.\n\nThe mom's reasoning was to wait until 18, but the user had a valid reason\u2014planning to work full-time soon and wanting the implant now for convenience. The mom's reaction seems to be based on not wanting to wait, even though the user is responsible and knows the side effects. The user mentioned they're not sexually active, which might be a point in their favor, but that's not necessarily relevant to the decision to get the implant for long-term planning.\n\nThe user also points out that their mom uses an IUD, implying some hypocrisy, but that's not a legal or ethical point. The key issue is the user's right to make their own medical decisions. Since they are a minor, the parents usually have some say, but in many cases, especially with reproductive health, minors can make these decisions independently. \n\nThe user's decision to act now rather than wait three months is practical. The mom's overreaction and lack of understanding about the user's reasoning (like work plans) suggest that the mom is being controlling. The user's actions were informed and for their own convenience, so they might not be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, if the mom's input was important and the user didn't consider her perspective, maybe the user is at fault for not communicating better. But the mom didn't provide a good reason to wait, just a blanket no. The user had their own reasons and took action, which is understandable for someone close to adulthood. \n\nSo, balancing legal rights, the user's autonomy, and the mom's overreaction, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
