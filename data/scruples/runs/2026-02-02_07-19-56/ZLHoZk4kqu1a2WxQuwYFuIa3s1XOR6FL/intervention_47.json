I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and switched their birth control to Nexplanon without telling their mom. The mom wanted them to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The author got the implant, the mom was upset, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, legal stuff: At 17, the author is a minor. In many places, minors can consent to certain healthcare decisions, especially reproductive health. So even if the mom didn't agree, the author might have the legal right to get the implant. But laws vary by location, so maybe the author should check their state's laws. However, the question is more about moral wrongness than legal.\n\nThen, the relationship aspect. The mom wanted to discuss it and set a deadline of 18. The author went ahead without communication. This could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the mom expected to be involved in the decision. The mom might feel disrespected or that her boundaries were crossed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a medical decision that's personal and long-term. They might feel their autonomy is important. The mom uses an IUD herself, so maybe she knows the implant is similar but is still upset. There's confusion here about why the age difference matters if the author is responsible and informed.\n\nThe author's reasons: convenience, future work, healing time. These are valid, but the method of decision-making is the issue. Did they consider their mom's perspective? Even if the mom was dismissive, open communication might have been better. The mom's reaction of hanging up and being upset shows she felt her authority was disregarded.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between their autonomy and respecting parental wishes. Since the mom had asked to wait and the author didn't communicate, it's a breach of trust. But if the author had the legal right and the decision is in their best interest, maybe not. However, the way they went about it without discussion might be seen as wrong. The answer might be A (yes) because they didn't respect their mom's request and the situation involves a parent-child dynamic where communication is key.\n"
