I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is a 17-year-old switching their birth control from the depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge. The mom had previously told the daughter to wait until she's 18, but the daughter went ahead and got the implant without her mom's consent. The mom was upset, hung up the phone when told, and is now researching and concerned about side effects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can make their own healthcare decisions regarding reproductive health, especially when it comes to birth control. So legally, the daughter might have the right to decide without her parent's consent. That's a point in her favor.\n\nThen there's the parental concern. The mom might feel that she's responsible for her daughter's health and wants to be involved in such decisions. The daughter, on the other hand, sees her mom as overreacting, especially since she's not sexually active and the mom uses an IUD herself. The daughter might think it's her right to make her own medical choices once she's of age enough to understand, even if she's not 18 yet.\n\nBut the daughter is 17, so maybe there's a legal gray area. Depending on the jurisdiction, parents might still have some authority. The daughter didn't communicate her reasons well; she says her mom didn't want to talk about it. Maybe the mom felt disrespected or that her wishes weren't considered. The daughter could have tried to find a middle ground, like waiting a bit or discussing the pros and cons more thoroughly.\n\nHowever, the daughter argues that waiting until 18 would be inconvenient because of her future work schedule. She's prioritizing her own needs, which is understandable. The mom's reaction might stem from fear or lack of understanding, but the daughter's autonomy is a key factor here.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider both legal rights and the emotional impact. Legally, the daughter might not be in the wrong if she's allowed to make her own decisions. Emotionally, she hurt her mom by going behind her back. There's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental concerns. The daughter could have handled it better by discussing more or seeking compromise, but the mom's overreaction is also a factor. The daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong if she had the right to decide, but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
