I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the 17-year-old is at fault for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. \n\nFirst, the mom initially said to wait until she's 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The daughter decided to get it done anyway. In the US, minors can sometimes make their own medical decisions regarding contraception, but that depends on state laws. However, the daughter is 17, so maybe emancipated, but maybe not. But the key issue here is the mom being upset because she wasn't consulted.\n\nThe daughter argues that she's making a decision for her body, especially since she's not sexually active but wants a long-term method. The mom is upset, even though she uses an IUD herself. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being respected if she's mature enough to make this choice. On the other hand, the mom might feel it's her role to guide decisions until the child is 18. \n\nBut considering that the daughter acted in her own health interests and the mom didn't engage in discussion, maybe the daughter isn't wrong. However, some might say not discussing it with a parent is wrong, especially since the mom was upset. But others might prioritize the daughter's autonomy. \n\nIn terms of legal rights, minors can consent to birth control in many states, so she might have the right to do so. The mom's reaction could be seen as overprotective. The daughter's reasoning about convenience and her future workload seems valid. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's making a health decision for herself, and the mom didn't engage in dialogue. But some might argue she should have discussed it more. However, since the mom was dismissive and didn't talk it through, the daughter acting on her own isn't entirely wrong.\n"
