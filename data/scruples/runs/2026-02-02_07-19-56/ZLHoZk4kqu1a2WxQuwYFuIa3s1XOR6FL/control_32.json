I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. The author is 17, got a Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent, and now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author had the right to make this decision. But the mom might have different views as a parent.\n\nThe author mentions they're not sexually active, but they wanted a long-term option because they'll be working more after 18. The mom didn't want them to get it until 18 and didn't engage in a discussion. The author felt dismissed and decided to proceed. \n\nThe mom's reaction is upsetness and asking about side effects, which the author points out are similar to the Depo shot. The mom also has an IUD, which might make her reaction seem inconsistent. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they wanted autonomy in their healthcare decision. However, not informing the mom could be a point of contention. But given that the mom wasn't willing to discuss it and set a condition (wait until 18) without providing reasoning, the author might feel justified in taking control of their own body.\n\nLegally, in some states, minors can consent to birth control. So the author might have been within their rights. Emotionally, the mom is upset, but the author acted in their own health interests. \n\nThe key factors here are the legality, the reason for the decision, and the parent's role. Since the author made an informed choice and the mom was dismissive, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
