I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for switching birth control without telling their mom. The author is 17, got the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent, and the mom is upset. The mom had previously told them to wait until 18, but the author decided to go ahead anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent for medical decisions. In the US, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, including birth control, in many states. So legally, the author might have the right to make this decision without parental consent. That's a point in their favor.\n\nNext, the mom's perspective. She wanted the author to wait until 18 and was upset that they didn't wait. She might feel that her authority as a parent is being challenged. Even though the author is legally able to make this choice, the mom might still feel it's part of her role to guide decisions for a minor. However, the author is 17, almost 18, and the procedure is for a longer-term solution. The author's reasoning about future work plans and convenience seems valid.\n\nThe mom's reaction\u2014hanging up and later being upset\u2014could indicate she feels disrespected. But the author might see their own autonomy as important, especially given their maturity and future plans. The fact that the author is not sexually active might reduce the urgency, but the medical decision is personal.\n\nOn the flip side, the author didn't communicate their decision until after the fact, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if they have the legal right, the parent might value open communication. The author could have explained their reasons more clearly and given the mom an opportunity to understand before proceeding.\n\nHowever, given the age and the legal aspects, the author's actions might be justified. The mom's overreaction might stem from her own biases or lack of information. The author is also taking responsibility for their health and future, which is commendable.\n\nSo, balancing legal rights, maturity, and communication, I think the author isn't entirely wrong. The mom's reaction is valid in a parent-child dynamic, but the author's decision is legally and personally reasonable. The fault might not be entirely on one side. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the legal aspect and the author's maturity, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the lack of communication could make them partially at fault. But the key point is legal consent and personal autonomy. So leaning towards B.\n"
