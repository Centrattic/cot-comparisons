I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who decided to get the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom had previously told them to wait until they turned 18 and didn't discuss their reasoning. The daughter got the implant, and the mom was upset.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. But the parent might still be involved if they're the legal guardian. The daughter might have the right to make this decision on her own, depending on local laws. However, the mom might feel that as a parent, she should be involved, especially if the daughter is under 18.\n\nNext, the daughter's reasoning: She wanted convenience and long-term effectiveness. The mom might be concerned about side effects, even though the daughter mentions they're similar to the Depo shot. The mom's reaction could be about wanting to be involved in her child's health decisions, even if she doesn't agree. The daughter might see this as controlling, while the mom sees it as protective.\n\nThe daughter is not sexually active and wants to prepare in advance, considering her future work schedule. The mom might not have considered the practical reasons. The daughter's autonomy is a key point here. At 17, she's almost an adult, but still a minor. The tension between parental authority and the child's growing independence is central.\n\nIs the daughter wrong for not consulting her mom? It depends on the relationship dynamics and legal context. If the law allows minors to make this decision, then she's not in the wrong. But if the mom believes she should be involved, then the daughter's choice might be seen as disrespectful. However, the daughter's right to bodily autonomy is also important.\n\nThe mom's overreaction might be due to fear, lack of information, or trying to maintain control. The daughter's explanation about her future plans could mitigate some of the mom's concerns. But the fact that the daughter went ahead without discussing it might have caused the conflict.\n\nIn some states, minors can consent to birth control without parental involvement. If that's the case here, the daughter is within her rights. But if the mom was legally supposed to be involved, then the daughter made a wrong choice. The answer also depends on cultural and family norms. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being respected, while the mom feels disrespected or excluded.\n\nSo, if the daughter acted within her legal rights and her mom's reaction is based on personal beliefs rather than legal necessity, then the daughter isn't in the wrong. But if the mom's involvement was required, then the daughter made a mistake. Since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, considering both legal and relational aspects, the answer could vary. However, the daughter's intent was to make a responsible decision for her future, and if the law supports her choice, she's not in the wrong.\n"
