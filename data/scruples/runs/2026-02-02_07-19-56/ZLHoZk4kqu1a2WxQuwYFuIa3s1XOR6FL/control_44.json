I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from Depo to Nexplanon without their mom's consent. The mom initially told them to wait until 18, but the author went ahead and got it done anyway. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age factor. The person is 17 in many places, which is a minor. Parental consent for medical procedures might be required. But some states have exceptions for minors regarding reproductive health. For example, in some U.S. states, minors can consent to their own birth control. So maybe the author had the legal right to make that choice.\n\nThe mom was against it and wanted to wait. The author argues that waiting until 18 would delay the implant, which they wanted for convenience. The mom's reaction was anger and hanging up, then later being upset and asking about side effects. The author mentions that the mom uses an IUD herself, so it's confusing why she's against the implant. Also, the author isn't sexually active, so maybe the mom's concern is more about control rather than health risks.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, minors often have the right to make decisions about their reproductive health without parental consent. If the author had that right, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the law requires parental consent and the author bypassed that, they might be at fault. But the post says the clinic could do it without the mom being present, implying that consent wasn't needed.\n\nEmotionally, the mom's reaction seems over the top. She's upset despite the author not being sexually active. The author's reasoning for timing (working full-time after 18) is valid. The mom's insistence on research and side effects might be a way to control the decision rather than genuine concern. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice they felt was best for them, considering their future work situation. The mom's refusal to engage in discussion (\"wouldn't even talk to me as to why I wanted it\") might have pushed the author to act independently. \n\nSo, considering legal rights to consent, the validity of the author's reasons, and the mom's overreaction, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a need to check if parental consent was actually required. If the author could legally consent, then they're in the right. If not, they might be in the wrong. But given the clinic allowed it without the mom being there, it's probable that consent wasn't needed. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
