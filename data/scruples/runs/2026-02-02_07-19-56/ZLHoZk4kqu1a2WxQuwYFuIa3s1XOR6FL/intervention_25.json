I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, gets the depo shot every three months. They wanted to switch to Nexplanon, a 5-year implant. They talked to their mom, who told them to wait until 18 and wasn't open to discussing it further. The author went ahead and got the implant without their mom's knowledge or consent. Now the mom is upset, even though she later forgot about it and things were okay until it came up again.\n\nSo, the author is 17, which is a minor in most places. Minors typically don't have the legal right to make certain medical decisions without parental consent. However, in some places, there are exceptions for reproductive health services. I need to check if the author's age and location affect their legal right to make this decision. But since the question doesn't specify location, maybe I should assume a general US context, where some states allow minors to consent to birth control. For example, in many states, minors can consent to contraceptive services. If that's the case here, then the author might legally be able to make that choice.\n\nBut the author's mom is upset because she wanted to wait until the author turns 18. The mom might feel that she's not being respected, especially since she had told the author to wait. The author argues that they're responsible and that the decision is for their own convenience and well-being. They also mention that they're not sexually active, so maybe the mom is concerned about other factors.\n\nThe key points here are: the legal right to consent to medical procedures (specifically birth control), the parent's authority over their minor child's decisions, and the child's autonomy.\n\nIf the author is legally allowed to make this decision on their own, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the parent's consent is required and the author went against that, then they might be in the wrong. But the article also mentions that in some cases, minors can consent to their own birth control without parental consent. So if that's the case here, the author's action could be justified.\n\nAdditionally, the mother has an IUD herself, which is a similar long-term method. The author questions why the mother objects when she uses a similar method. That adds a layer where the mother's reasoning might seem inconsistent.\n\nThe author's mom is upset about the side effects, even though they're similar to the depo shot. The author might feel that the mother isn't listening to their reasoning. Also, the author mentions practical reasons like working full-time in the future and needing the implant now when their arm can heal better.\n\nSo, if the author was legally allowed to make that decision, then they're not in the wrong. If not, they might be. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just legally, but ethically. Even if legal, the ethical aspect involves respect for parental wishes. However, the author might argue that their autonomy and right to make their own health decisions take precedence, especially if the parent isn't open to discussion.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often considers both legal and ethical aspects. If the author acted within their rights and the mother is overreacting, then the answer might be B (not in the wrong). If the author acted without considering the parent's role in decision-making, even if legally allowed, there might be a case for A (in the wrong).\n\nBut since the author is 17 and the mother is the parent, there's a balance between the minor's autonomy and the parent's authority. In some cases, even if legal, the parent might feel the child is acting prematurely or without full understanding. The author might be right in making their own health decisions, but if the mother had a legitimate reason to be involved, then the author could be seen as in the wrong for not respecting that.\n\nHowever, given that the author is making a responsible decision for their own health, and the mother is dismissing their reasons, the community might side with the author. Also, if the law allows minors to consent to birth control, that strengthens the case for the author not being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
