I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the user is 17 and decided to switch from the depo shot to the nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The mom wanted her to wait until she's 18, but the user went ahead and got the implant. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can make their own healthcare decisions, especially regarding contraception. So legally, the user might be within her rights to make this choice. But then there's the parental involvement part. Some states require parental consent for certain medical procedures, but maybe not all. The user didn't mention her location, so I should consider both possibilities.\n\nThe user mentioned that her mom didn't talk about why she wanted the implant, which might have led to misunderstandings. The mom's reaction\u2014hanging up and being upset\u2014could be because she felt disrespected or that her authority is being ignored. The user's reasoning is that she's not sexually active and wants long-term control, which is valid. Also, the mom uses an IUD herself, so maybe she's not being consistent.\n\nBut the user didn't communicate properly. Even if she had the right to decide, not discussing it with her mom might have been hurtful. The mom might feel that the user didn't respect her opinion or that she was excluded from the decision-making process. The user's mom brought up research and side effects, which could indicate she felt unprepared or worried about the decision.\n\nSo, while the user might have the right to make the decision, the way she did it without discussing it further with her mom could be seen as the issue. The key factors are the user's autonomy versus the parent's role in decision-making. In some contexts, getting parental consent is expected, even if not legally required. The user might not be in the wrong legally, but socially or relationally, she might have made a mistake by not communicating better.\n"
