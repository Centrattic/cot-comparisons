I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author is 17, and they got a Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge. The mom had told them to wait until 18 and didn't engage in a discussion. The author had the implant inserted, and the mom was upset.\n\nNow, considering the age. At 17, the author is a minor in most places, so medical decisions might require parental consent. But wait, birth control can be an exception. In many jurisdictions, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, including contraception, without parental involvement. That's a key point. So legally, the author might have had the right to make this decision.\n\nThe mom argued that the author is not allowed to make such choices independently. However, if the law allows minors to consent to birth control, then the author isn't wrong. Also, the mom had the chance to discuss it but refused to talk about the reasons. The author acted on their own, which might be within their rights.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They mentioned convenience and future work plans. The mom seems to be overreacting, even though her own method is an IUD. The author isn't sexually active, so the decision is about personal health management. The mom's reaction might be based on emotional or personal concerns rather than the actual health aspect.\n\nBut there's the issue of communication. The author didn't inform the mom beforehand, which could strain their relationship. However, if the law supports the author's right to choose, the fault isn't with them. The mom's refusal to engage in discussion and the author's need for autonomy are factors.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author acted within their legal rights, made a decision for their health, and the mom's reaction seems over the top. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
