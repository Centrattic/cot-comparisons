I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom initially told them to wait until 18 and later got upset when they went ahead anyway.\n\nFirst, the author is a minor, so legal guardians typically have a say in medical decisions, even if the minor is close to 18. However, some states allow minors to make their own decisions regarding reproductive health. That's a legal consideration. But the question is more about whether they're in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nThe author did mention their plan to their mom, but she refused and didn't engage in discussion. They went ahead without her consent. Even if the mom was dismissive, the author could have tried to find another way to get her on board or explain their reasoning more thoroughly. The fact that the mom hung up and later expressed upset suggests there was a communication breakdown.\n\nAlso, the author's reasons (convenience, avoiding side effects, work schedule) are valid. However, the mom's concern about research and side effects might stem from wanting to protect her child. Even if the author isn't sexually active, the decision to change birth control is a medical one that parents might feel responsible for.\n\nBut the author is a teenager making a decision about their own body. There's a balance between parental guidance and personal autonomy. The author might argue they're capable of making this choice. However, since they were a minor and the mom was the legal guardian, not informing her could be seen as disregarding her role.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom didn't engage in a meaningful discussion and just dismissed the request. The author might feel their autonomy was being denied. The key is whether the author had the right to make this decision without parental input given their age.\n\nIn some places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. If that's the case here, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the law requires parental consent, then they could be in the wrong.\n\nSince the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not just legally, the answer might depend on the cultural or familial norms. The author acted on their own without discussing further, which could be seen as disrespectful to the parent's role. However, the parent's initial dismissal might have pushed the author to act.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their mom's input, even if the mom was dismissive. But there's also argument for the author's autonomy. The situation is complex, but leaning towards the author might be in the wrong because they went ahead without communication, despite the parent's concerns.\n"
