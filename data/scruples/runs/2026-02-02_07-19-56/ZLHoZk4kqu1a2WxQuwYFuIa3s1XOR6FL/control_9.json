I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is 17 and decided to get the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. Her mom had previously said to wait until she's 18, but the author went ahead anyway. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author had the legal right to make that decision. But the situation is about whether she was in the wrong morally or in terms of parent-child dynamics.\n\nThe mom wanted her to wait until 18, possibly because of her age and the 5-year commitment of the implant. The daughter argues that waiting three months wouldn't change much, and that getting it now is more convenient while she's not working full-time. The mom is upset because she feels the daughter didn't respect her wishes and is concerned about the long-term commitment.\n\nThe daughter is not sexually active, so the necessity of the implant isn't for immediate contraception but more for future planning. The mom has an IUD, yet she's against the implant, which is confusing. The daughter might feel that her autonomy is being denied, especially since she's making an informed choice.\n\nHowever, the mom's role is to guide and protect, even if the child is making a decision they consider mature. The daughter didn't communicate her decision until after the fact, which might have caused the mom to feel disrespected. The daughter could have tried to compromise, like getting the implant now but agreeing to discuss it again in three months if the mom was still concerned. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is making a personal health decision that she's researched and understands the side effects. The mom's reaction could be overprotective. The key points are consent laws, the daughter's maturity in understanding the procedure, and the communication breakdown. \n\nSince the daughter is a minor but in some regions can consent to birth control, she might not be in the wrong legally. Ethically, it's a gray area. The mom's concern is valid, but the daughter's autonomy is also important. The author didn't lie but went against her mom's wishes, which might be seen as a breach of trust. However, the mom's refusal to discuss the reasons and the author's informed decision might tip the scales towards the author not being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), because the author made an informed health decision, and the mom's reasons (waiting until 18) might not be legally binding. The author's actions, while possibly causing a conflict, are not necessarily wrong given the circumstances.\n"
