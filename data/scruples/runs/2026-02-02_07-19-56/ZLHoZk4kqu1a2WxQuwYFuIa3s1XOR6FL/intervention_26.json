I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 17-year-old got the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom, who initially told them to wait until they turn 18. The mom was upset and said she wanted to do research and was concerned about side effects. The author thinks the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom has an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent for medical decisions. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So if the 17-year-old was legally allowed to make this decision on their own, then maybe they weren't wrong. But sometimes parental consent is required, depending on location and the specific procedure. The author mentioned that the clinic could do it without the mom being present, which might mean that was allowed legally.\n\nNext, the mom's reaction. She told the author to wait until 18 but then got upset when they went ahead. The author had their own reasons\u2014convenience, healing time before starting a job. The mom questioned the side effects, even though they're similar to the Depo shot. The author is not sexually active, so maybe the mom's concerns are about other things. The author might feel that their autonomy is being respected, but the mom is upset and wants to research. \n\nIs the author wrong for not waiting? The mom did ask to wait, but the author felt it was a personal decision. If the author could legally consent, then maybe they had the right to make the choice. However, there's a cultural or familial expectation here of informing the mom, especially if she was part of the previous decision-making. The author might be seen as disregarding the mom's wishes, even if they had the right to make the medical decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's reasoning for waiting seems a bit unclear. She just said to wait until 18 without explaining why. The author might feel that their autonomy and future planning (working full-time) are valid reasons to proceed now. \n\nSo, the key points are: legal consent, respect for parental wishes, and the author's right to make their own health decisions. If the author had the legal right and the mom's initial instruction was to wait without a clear reason, the author might be justified. However, if the author was supposed to be under the mom's care and the mom was part of medical decision-making, then maybe the author should have discussed it more. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The author might not be in the wrong if they had the legal right to consent. But from a relational standpoint, the mom was involved in previous decisions and now feels disrespected. The answer might depend on cultural norms and specific laws, but generally, the author could be seen as not wrong if they had the right to make the decision. However, the fact that they didn't communicate with the mom after getting it might have caused the conflict. But the mom did hang up on them, which is also a strong reaction. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
