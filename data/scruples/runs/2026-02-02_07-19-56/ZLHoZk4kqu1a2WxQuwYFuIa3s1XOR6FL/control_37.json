I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom wanted them to wait until they turned 18, but the author went ahead and got it. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding minors and medical decisions. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially those related to reproductive health. For example, in the US, some states allow minors to consent to birth control without parental notification. So legally, the author might have the right to make this decision on their own.\n\nNext, the mom's reaction. She wanted the author to wait until 18, but didn't provide a clear reason. She also mentioned doing research on side effects, which could indicate she's justifying her decision after the fact. The author points out that the mom uses an IUD herself, so there's inconsistency in the mom's stance. Also, the author is not sexually active, so the mom's concern about immediate sexual activity might not apply here.\n\nThe author's reasoning for getting the implant now is practical: they want to get it done before starting a job that might make healing more difficult. They also mention convenience, as Nexplanon lasts longer than the Depo shot. Since the author is making a responsible decision for their own health and future, even if the mom disagrees, it might be their right to choose.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of parental rights. Parents typically have a role in guiding their children's decisions, especially minors. The author didn't communicate their decision-making process clearly, which might have caused the conflict. The mom's anger could stem from feeling disrespected or unheard, even if the author had the legal right to decide.\n\nBut considering the author is 17, almost 18, and making a decision that affects their own body, it's a balance between parental authority and the minor's autonomy. In many cases, especially regarding reproductive health, minors are allowed to make such choices. The author might not be in the wrong if they had the legal right and acted in their best interest.\n\nThe key points are the legality of the minor's consent, the parent's valid concerns versus overreaction, and the minor's ability to make informed decisions. The author's decision seems to be based on practicality and long-term planning, and the mom's reaction seems inconsistent given her own use of an IUD. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
