I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 17 and decided to switch from Depo to Nexplanon without telling their mom. The mom wanted them to wait until 18 and then later got upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age. In the US, the age of majority is 18. Even if they're a minor, can a 17-year-old consent to medical procedures like birth control? I think in some states, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. But it depends on the state. However, the mom here is a parent, so she might have legal authority.\n\nThe user mentioned that the mom said to wait until 18. The user went ahead without her consent. That's a key point. The mom is upset because they didn't follow her decision. But the user argues that the mom is overreacting, given she uses an IUD herself. Also, the user is not sexually active, so maybe the mom's concern is about readiness or future implications.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they wanted a long-term solution and thought it was better now. They also had practical reasons about work after 18. The mom, however, might feel disrespected or that the decision should be joint. The user's actions could be seen as defying the parent's wishes, even if the parent's reasoning isn't fully explained.\n\nBut the user is old enough to understand the decision, and birth control choices can be personal. However, legally, without the parent's consent, there might be issues. But in some places, minors can consent to birth control. If that's the case, then the user isn't in the wrong. However, the question is about being in the wrong in terms of right and wrong, not just legally. Socially, the user might be seen as acting without respecting parental authority. The mom might feel that the decision should be made together, especially since the user is a minor.\n\nBut the user is 17, close to 18, and making a decision for a long-term method. The mom's reaction could be over the top, especially if the user is responsible and the procedure is safe. The fact that the user discussed it with the mom before but she dismissed it might add to the user's frustration. Also, the user not being sexually active might make the mom's reaction seem unnecessary.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and context. The user's intent was to make a decision for their own convenience, while the mom wanted to wait. The user might not be in the wrong if they acted within their legal rights and the decision is personal. However, the parent's feelings and the lack of communication are factors. The user went ahead without discussing it further, which could be seen as disrespectful. But if the parent was dismissive, the user might feel justified.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user had the legal right to consent. If yes, then they aren't wrong. If not, then they are. But without knowing the state laws, it's tricky. However, since the user got the implant done, maybe the clinic allowed them to consent. In that case, the user isn't in the wrong. The parent's upset reaction might stem from feeling disrespected, but the user's action could be justified if they had the authority. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
