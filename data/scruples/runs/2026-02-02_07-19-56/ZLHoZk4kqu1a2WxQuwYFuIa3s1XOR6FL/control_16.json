I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, which in many places is still a minor. They wanted to switch from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant, which is a longer-term method. They mentioned it to their mom, who said to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. Then the author went ahead and got the implant without their mom's consent. Now the mom is upset and hung up on them. The author argues that their mom is overreacting, especially since she uses an IUD herself. The author also mentions that they're not sexually active but wanted a long-term solution.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent for medical decisions varies. In some places, minors can consent to certain medical procedures, including birth control, without parental consent. So maybe the author was within their rights. However, if the parent is the one who typically handles the medical decisions or if there's a legal requirement for parental consent in their state, then the author might have overstepped. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nThe mom's perspective is that she wanted to wait until the daughter turned 18. The daughter felt that waiting would complicate things with her job plans. The mom is upset now and wants to research, which the daughter finds unreasonable. The daughter is confused why the mom is so upset given that she uses an IUD herself.\n\nFrom the daughter's side, they wanted autonomy. They might feel that since they're mature enough to handle medical decisions, they should be allowed to make this choice. The mom, on the other hand, might feel that the daughter is too young to make such a long-term commitment and wants to protect them from possible side effects or complications, even if the daughter is not currently sexually active.\n\nBut the daughter is 17, which is very close to 18. They did consult with their mom before and got a refusal, but then proceeded without her. The key points here are consent and autonomy. If the daughter could legally get the implant without parental consent, then she might be in the right. However, if the parent expected to be involved in such decisions based on their relationship, then the daughter might have breached trust.\n\nAlso, the daughter not being sexually active is a point. Some parents might worry about the implications of using birth control when not active, but the daughter's reasoning is about convenience and future planning. The mom's reaction could stem from different priorities. The fact that the mom uses an IUD herself complicates things, as it shows she's comfortable with long-term methods, yet she's opposing her daughter's choice.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's about balancing the daughter's right to autonomy with the parent's right to protect. If the daughter is capable of making an informed decision and the procedure is legal for her age, then she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, not informing the mom could be seen as disrespectful, even if legally permissible. The mom's upset might be about the breach of trust rather than the medical decision itself.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the daughter's actions were within her rights and if the mom's expectations were communicated clearly. If the daughter had the legal right to make the decision, then she's not in the wrong. If not, then she might be. But the question is more about being in the wrong morally. Since the daughter did what she believed was best for her future and the mom's refusal to discuss the reasons might have led the daughter to proceed, it's a complex situation. However, the daughter might not be in the wrong if she acted within her legal rights and with her own informed decision.\n"
