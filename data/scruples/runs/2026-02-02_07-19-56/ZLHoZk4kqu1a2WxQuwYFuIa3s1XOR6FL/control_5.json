I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting a birth control implant without their mom's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age. The author is 17, and in many places, the age of majority is 18. So, at 17, they might not have the legal right to make their own medical decisions, especially for something like a birth control implant. But laws vary by location. If the state allows minors to make medical decisions about reproductive health, that could change things. However, the mom is involved here, so maybe she has legal custody.\n\nThe mom's perspective is important. She told the author to wait until 18 and then got upset when they went ahead. The author argues that waiting would mean more time before the next treatment, and that they're not sexually active. The mom is concerned about side effects and research, even though she uses an IUD herself. \n\nEthically, minors often rely on parental consent for medical procedures. The author might feel they're mature enough to make their own choice, but the mom might feel responsible for guiding them. The fact that the author is not sexually active might reduce the immediate health risks, but the decision is still a medical one with long-term implications.\n\nAlso, the author didn't inform the mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author had good reasons for acting quickly, not communicating with the parent could lead to conflict. The mom's reaction of being upset and hanging up shows the emotional impact.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, legally, the author might not be able to make that decision without consent. Ethically, it's about autonomy versus parental responsibility. Since the author is under 18, the parent might have the authority, so the author could be in the wrong. However, if the author is allowed by law to consent independently, that's different. But the scenario doesn't specify that. So considering standard legal frameworks, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But there's nuance here. The author's reasoning about convenience and future work might be valid, but the decision to make it without consent is the issue. The mom's overreaction might be part of the problem too, but the core question is about the author's actions. So leaning towards A.\n"
