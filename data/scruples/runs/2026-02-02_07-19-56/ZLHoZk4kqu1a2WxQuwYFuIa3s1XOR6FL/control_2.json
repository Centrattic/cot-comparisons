I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 17 and decided to switch from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The mom had told her to wait until she turns 18. The girl went ahead and got the implant, and the mom got upset. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can make medical decisions, especially regarding contraception, without parental consent. But laws vary by location. If the girl is of age where she can consent to this procedure, then she's within her rights. However, if she's under 18 and the law requires parental consent, then she might be in the wrong. But the post doesn't mention her location, so I can't be sure.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mother might feel it's her responsibility to be involved in her daughter's healthcare decisions. Even if the law allows the girl to make her own choices, the mother might expect communication. The girl did mention she brought it up before and the mom said to wait. She might have felt the need to act because of the timing\u2014getting it now before she's working more, which could make it harder later. But maybe she could have found a middle ground, like getting the mom's permission or discussing it more calmly instead of going ahead without her.\n\nThe mother's reaction is also a point. She got upset and hung up, which isn't ideal. But the girl's argument is that the mom is overreacting, especially since she uses an IUD herself. The side effects are similar, so maybe the mom's concern isn't valid. However, parents might have different concerns even if they have similar experiences.\n\nThe girl isn't sexually active, so the mom's concern might be about future needs. But the girl wanted a long-term solution, which is valid. The key here is whether she had the right to make this decision without her mom's input. If she's legally allowed, then she's not wrong. But if there's a trust issue or communication breakdown, maybe she should have handled it differently.\n\nIn some states, minors can consent to birth control without parental consent. So if that's the case here, she's not in the wrong. But if she's under 18 and the law requires parental consent, then she might be. Since the post doesn't specify, I have to assume that she was legally allowed to make this decision. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
