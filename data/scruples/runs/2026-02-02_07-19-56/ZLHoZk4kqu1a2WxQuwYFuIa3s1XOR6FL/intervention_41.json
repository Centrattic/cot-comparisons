I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17 and switched their birth control to Nexplanon without telling their mom. The mom had initially told them to wait until they're 18. The author got the implant without the mom's consent, and the mom was upset.\n\nFirst, the author is a minor, so legally, parents usually have a say in medical decisions. But minors can sometimes consent to certain medical treatments, like birth control, depending on the location. The author mentions that the clinic could do it without the mom being there. So maybe the author had the legal right to do it on their own, but the mom is upset because they didn't ask.\n\nThe mom's reaction is harsh, hanging up, then being upset later. The author argues that waiting until 18 would mean more time working and lifting, so now is better. The mom is asking about side effects, even though the author knows them. The author is confused why the mom is overreacting since she uses an IUD herself.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Legally, if the clinic allowed it, the author might have the right. But ethically, not informing a parent when they had asked to wait could be seen as a breach of trust. The mom might feel disrespected or worry about the health risks. However, the author is making a decision about their own body and future, which is a valid perspective. \n\nBut since the mom had already asked to wait until 18, the author didn't follow that request. The question is whether the author should have waited despite having the legal ability to get it. The mom's authority as a parent versus the author's autonomy as a minor is tricky. \n\nIn some places, minors can consent to birth control without parental consent, which might mean the author acted within their rights. However, the mom's feelings about trust and communication are also important. Even if it's legal, the author might still be in the wrong from a relational standpoint for not respecting the mom's wishes. \n\nBut the author's reasoning for getting it now (work demands, healing time) is valid. The mom's reaction seems inconsistent, especially since she uses an IUD herself. The author might feel that their autonomy is being unjustly restricted. \n\nSo, it's a mix of legal rights, parental authority, and communication. The answer could hinge on whether the author should have discussed it more, even though they had the right to make the choice. But since the mom had specifically asked to wait until 18, the author's actions might be seen as disregarding the parent's wishes, making them at fault. However, if the author had the legal right to consent, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't follow the parent's request, but there's a strong argument for B (not in the wrong) due to autonomy and legal consent. The situation is nuanced, but the parent's authority as a guardian might tip the balance towards A.\n"
