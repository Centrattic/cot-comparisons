I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom initially told them to wait until 18, then got upset when they went ahead without her. The key points here are the age, the decision-making process, and the mom's reaction.\n\nFirst, the age is important. In many places, minors can make their own healthcare decisions regarding birth control without parental consent. So legally, the author might be within their rights to make this choice. But the situation is also about parental expectations and communication.\n\nThe mom wanted the daughter to wait until 18, possibly out of concern or wanting to discuss it further. The daughter felt the need to act now because she's not working full-time yet and wants to get it done before her job duties change. The mom's reaction was to hang up and later express being upset, questioning the daughter's understanding of side effects. However, the daughter argues that the side effects are similar to the Depo shot.\n\nThe daughter is not sexually active, which might make the mom's reaction even more puzzling. The daughter's autonomy is a factor here. At 17, she's close to 18 and might feel capable of making this decision. The mom, having an IUD herself, might not see the issue, but perhaps she's projecting her own experiences or has different concerns.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the daughter can consent to birth control independently, then she isn't wrong. However, from a relational perspective, not discussing it with her mom could be seen as disrespectful. But considering the mom's initial refusal to engage in a discussion, the daughter might feel there was no other way. The daughter's reasoning about convenience and future work plans is valid.\n\nSo, while there might be some relational tension, the daughter's action could be justified both legally and practically. The mom's overreaction might stem from control issues or lack of understanding. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
