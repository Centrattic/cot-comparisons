I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old getting a birth control implant without their mom's consent, even though the mom had previously told them to wait until they turned 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. The age of majority is 18 in the US, but some states allow minors to make decisions about their own healthcare, including birth control. So legally, the person might have the right to make this decision without parental consent.\n\nNext, the parent's perspective. The mom wanted the child to wait until 18. The child might feel that waiting isn't necessary, especially since they're already on another form of birth control and the new one is a long-term solution. The mom's reaction seems to be based on wanting to have control over her child's medical decisions, even though the child is of age to make their own choices legally.\n\nThe child's reasoning includes convenience, future work plans, and not being sexually active. They also mention that the procedure's side effects are similar to their previous method. The parent's objection seems overblown, especially since she uses an IUD herself. It might be a generational or communication issue.\n\nBut the child made the decision without discussing it further. Even though the parent had said to wait, the child went ahead, which the parent might see as a betrayal or lack of respect for boundaries. However, if the child has the legal right to make this decision, then the parent's upset might be more about the method than the decision itself.\n\nSo, the main points are legal rights, maturity of the child in making informed decisions, and the parent's overreaction. The child might not be in the wrong if they had the legal capacity to consent, but the situation also involves the parent's feelings. However, the parent's insistence on control despite the child's autonomy could be the bigger issue here.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the child made an informed decision about their healthcare, possibly with legal rights to do so, and the parent's reaction is more about control rather than valid medical concerns.\n"
