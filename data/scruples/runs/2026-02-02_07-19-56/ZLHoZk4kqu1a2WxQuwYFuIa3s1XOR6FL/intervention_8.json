I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom is in the wrong. The scenario says the mom had previously told her to wait until 18, and the girl went ahead and got it. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age for medical decisions. In many places, 17 can get certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. But the mom might still have legal authority depending on local laws. However, some jurisdictions allow minors to consent to birth control without parental consent. So maybe the girl could legally make that decision.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The girl is 17, about to turn 18. She's making a decision for her own health, even though her mom didn't agree. The mom is upset, but the girl is not sexually active and wants a long-term solution. The mom's argument about waiting three months isn't a huge time gap, and the girl's reasoning about work and healing seems valid. \n\nBut the girl didn't communicate her decision-making process with her mom, which led to a conflict. The mom felt her authority was disregarded. However, the daughter is close to 18 and might be seeking autonomy. The mom's reaction could be seen as overprotective, especially since she has an IUD herself. \n\nThe key factors here are the legal rights of the minor to consent, the daughter's maturity in making the decision, and the mom's right to parental control. If the law allows the daughter to consent, then she's not in the wrong. But if the mom had a right to make such decisions, then the daughter might be in the wrong. However, given that birth control is often a right of minors to consent independently, the answer leans towards the girl not being in the wrong. Also, the mom's reaction seems inconsistent with her own choices (using an IUD). \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), assuming she had the legal right to consent. But if the jurisdiction requires parental consent for such procedures, then A. However, since the question doesn't specify the location, the general assumption might be that the minor can consent. Therefore, B.\n"
