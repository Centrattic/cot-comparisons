I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom wanted them to wait until 18, but the author went ahead and got it done. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent for medical decisions varies, but in many places, minors can make their own decisions regarding reproductive health. So legally, the author might have the right to choose. However, the mom might still feel protective, especially if she's involved in healthcare decisions.\n\nThe author mentions that they're not sexually active, but they wanted a long-term method. That's a personal choice. The mom is using an IUD herself, which is a similar method, so her reaction seems a bit contradictory. The author might feel it's their body and their right to decide. On the other hand, the mom might feel that at 17, they're not mature enough yet or that 3 more months wouldn't make a difference. \n\nCommunication was an issue too. The author tried to discuss it, but the mom shut down the conversation. By acting without consent, the author might have caused a breach of trust. But if they had the legal right to make the decision, the mom's upset might be more about feeling disrespected than about the medical choice itself.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's action was within their legal rights, but the way they handled it (without discussing further) might have caused unnecessary conflict. However, the core issue is about autonomy versus parental control. Since the author is a minor but in a position to make their own reproductive choices, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
