I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 17 years old and decided to switch from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom had previously told them to wait until they turn 18, which is three months away. The author went ahead and got the implant inserted without the mom's consent. Now the mom is upset, hung up on them initially, and later expressed concerns about side effects and research. The author feels the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom herself has an IUD.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical aspects. At 17, the author is a minor, so their parent (mom) typically has legal authority over medical decisions. However, in some jurisdictions, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. For example, in the US, many states allow minors to consent to contraceptive procedures. So, legally, the author might be within their rights to make this decision without parental consent. But this can vary by location, so that's a key point.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The mom asked the author to wait until 18, and the author went ahead without discussing further. The author might have felt they were responsible enough to make this choice, especially since they mentioned they're not sexually active and want a long-term solution. However, the mom's reaction suggests she feels her authority was disregarded. She might have had her own reasons for wanting to wait, perhaps related to the author's age, potential side effects, or other concerns she didn't voice.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're making an informed decision, similar to their mom's choice of an IUD. The mom's response seems inconsistent since she uses an IUD herself but is upset about the daughter's choice. This inconsistency might fuel the author's frustration. However, parents often have different perspectives and might want their children to go through certain steps (like discussing at 18) for educational or developmental reasons.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't wait for the mom to do her research as requested. Instead, they took action, which could be seen as disrespectful to the mom's wishes. Even if the author is legally allowed to make the decision, the mom might value open communication and mutual decision-making. The author's actions could undermine the mom's attempts to guide them through the process, which might be part of preparing them to make such decisions independently as an adult.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking responsibility for their body and health. They might feel that waiting three months isn't necessary, especially if they're not sexually active and the procedure is safe. The fact that they got it done and the mom later forgot about it and seemed upset suggests there's a disconnect in how the mom approached the situation. The mom's initial refusal without explanation and then the anger after the fact might indicate she didn't handle the situation well.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I need to weigh the legal rights, the parent's authority, the communication breakdown, and the maturity of the author. If the author is legally allowed to make this decision, they might not be in the wrong, but they should have communicated better. However, since the mom had already set a condition (wait until 18) and the author ignored it, the author might be at fault for not respecting the mom's wishes, even if the mom's reasoning wasn't fully explained.\n\nBut given that reproductive health decisions are often considered the individual's right, and the author's maturity in understanding the procedure, it's a close call. The answer might depend on cultural and legal contexts. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to verify that.\n"
