I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch their birth control without telling their mom. They had been talking about Nexplanon and their mom wanted them to wait until 18. The user went ahead and got it done, and now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. So legally, the author might have the right to make this decision. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally. \n\nThe mom's reaction is important here. She wanted the author to wait until 18, maybe for reasons related to her own control or concern. The author felt that waiting until 18 would be inconvenient because they'll be working full-time then. That's a valid point, but the mom might feel that the author isn't mature enough to make such a decision independently.\n\nThe author is not sexually active, which reduces the immediate risk of pregnancy, but the choice of long-term contraception is still a personal one. The mom has an IUD herself, so maybe she doesn't understand why her child's decision is different. However, that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong in her reaction.\n\nSwitching birth control without informing a parent can be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the parent was involved in previous decisions. The author might have felt the need for autonomy, but the mom might see it as defiance. The key factors are consent laws, the reason for the switch, and the parent's role in medical decisions.\n\nSince the author is of age in some jurisdictions to make this decision without parental consent, legally they might not be wrong. Ethically, it's more about the relationship and communication. The author could have explained their reasoning better or found a compromise. But given the mom's strict stance and the author's valid reasons, the author might not be in the wrong. However, going behind the parent's back could still be seen as disrespectful. The answer might depend on the specific laws and the context of their relationship.\n"
