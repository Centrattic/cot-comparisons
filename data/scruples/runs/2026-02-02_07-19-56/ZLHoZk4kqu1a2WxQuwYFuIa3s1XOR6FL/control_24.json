I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to get the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom had asked them to wait until they turned 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The daughter went ahead and got it, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 17, the user is a minor, so medical decisions typically require parental consent. However, in some places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, including contraception, without parental involvement. But this varies by jurisdiction. If the daughter can get it without parental consent legally, then maybe she's justified. But if she needed consent and went without it, that could be a problem.\n\nNext, the emotional side. The mom might feel that the daughter made a significant medical decision without discussing it thoroughly. Even if the mom's initial response was dismissive, the daughter could have tried to understand her concerns better. The mom is upset about the lack of communication and the sudden change without her input.\n\nThe daughter argues that she's not sexually active and wants long-term contraception. The mom uses being 18 as a reason to wait, but the daughter points out that the timing difference isn't significant. The mom's reaction seems inconsistent since she has an IUD herself. This might indicate some double standards, but the daughter still needs to respect her mom's role in decision-making until she's 18.\n\nConsidering autonomy, minors have some rights, especially regarding their own bodies, but there's a balance between autonomy and parental guidance. The daughter might feel her autonomy was denied when the mom refused to discuss it, but acting without consent could still be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the key points are whether the daughter acted within her legal rights, respected her mom's initial stance, and communicated her decision properly. If she did it without consent and the mom was involved in her healthcare decisions, then the daughter might be in the wrong. However, if the daughter's actions were legally permissible and she had valid reasons for proceeding independently, she might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer depends on legal context and the expectations around parental involvement in healthcare decisions for minors. If the daughter could legally consent, then she's not in the wrong. If not, maybe she is. But there's also the aspect of communication and respecting parental input, which the daughter didn't do, which might make her partly at fault even if legally she's okay.\n"
