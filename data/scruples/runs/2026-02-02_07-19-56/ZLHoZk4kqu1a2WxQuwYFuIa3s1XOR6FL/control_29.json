I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the 17-year-old is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they did something wrong by switching their birth control from the Depo shot to Nexplanon without telling their mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age for making such decisions. In the US, minors can typically consent to reproductive health services, including birth control, without parental permission. So if the location is in a state where that's allowed, the author might be within their rights.\n\nThe mom's reaction was to tell them to wait until 18, but the author got the implant anyway. The mom was upset and asked about side effects, which the author mentioned are similar to the Depo shot. The author also pointed out that they're not sexually active, so maybe the mom's concern isn't about immediate health but rather about the child's readiness or autonomy.\n\nThe mom has an IUD herself, so it's a bit contradictory. Maybe she's worried about the author not doing enough research, but the author had already discussed it with the doctor. The author's reasoning is that they want a long-term solution before starting a full-time job, which seems practical.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the author isn't mature enough to make such a decision without input. But the author is 17, close to 18, and the procedure is a common form of birth control. If the author is capable of making informed decisions about their own health, then maybe they're not in the wrong. The key points are legality, the author's maturity, and the fact that they consulted a doctor. The mom's upset reaction might be more about control than the actual decision. So the answer could be B, not in the wrong.\n"
