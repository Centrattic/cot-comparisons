I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who decided to get the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom had previously said to wait until they turn 18, but the author went ahead anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. So maybe the author had the legal right to make this decision. But laws vary by location, so I should check if that's a factor here. The story doesn't specify the location, so I might have to assume a general case where minors can consent to birth control.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The mom did express her opinion and asked the author to wait. The author felt it was a better choice for their circumstances, like not working full-time yet, which makes the healing process easier. The mom is upset because she feels the author didn't inform her and is now doing research on the implant. The author points out that the mom uses an IUD herself, so maybe the mom's reaction is inconsistent.\n\nBut the mom is the parent, so she might feel responsible for making sure the author makes informed decisions. The author argues they're not sexually active, so maybe the mom thinks it's unnecessary. However, the author is planning for the future. The mom's overreaction might stem from wanting to protect her child, even if her reasoning is unclear.\n\nIs the author wrong for not informing the mom? It depends on the parent-child relationship. In some families, open communication is expected, so not telling the mom could be seen as disrespectful. But if the author felt the mom was dismissive and wouldn't listen, maybe acting independently was necessary. The author did mention the reasons, like healing time before starting full-time work.\n\nThe mom hanging up and then being upset might indicate she's hurt that the author didn't respect her initial request. But the author had valid reasons. The question is whether the author had the right to make this decision without the mom's consent. Legally, if allowed, then no. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong, but the situation shows a communication breakdown. The answer might hinge on the legal ability to consent and the context of the parent's role. If the author could legally make the decision, then B (not in the wrong) makes sense. If not, then A. But since the author did get the implant and the mom is upset, the answer might be B, considering the author's autonomy and valid reasons.\n"
