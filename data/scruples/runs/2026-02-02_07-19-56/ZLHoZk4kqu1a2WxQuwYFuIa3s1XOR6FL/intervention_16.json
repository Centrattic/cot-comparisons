I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting Nexplanon without telling their mom. The situation is that the author is 17 and had been using the Depo shot. They wanted a more convenient long-term option like Nexplanon. They discussed it with their mom, who told them to wait until 18. The author went ahead and got it without her, and now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can consent to contraceptive treatments on their own. So maybe the author has the legal right to make this decision. But the mom might have different views, even if she's the one who has an IUD herself. The mom's reaction could be based on her own concerns about the procedure or side effects, even if they are similar to Depo. Also, the mom might feel that as a parent, she should be involved in such decisions. However, the author is 17, almost 18, and might be seen as capable of making their own healthcare decisions. The fact that the author isn't sexually active might also play a role, but the decision is still about future protection. The key points are the legal right to consent, the parent's authority versus the minor's autonomy, and the specific circumstances like age and the nature of the medical procedure. \n\nIn some states, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, including birth control. If that's the case here, the author isn't legally in the wrong. However, if the mom was covering the costs or if there's a specific family dynamic where the author was expected to discuss it first, there might be a relational issue. But legally and medically, the author might have the right. So, based on that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, depending on the jurisdiction and specific family circumstances, there could be nuances. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and assuming they have the right to consent, the answer would be B.\n"
