I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is 17, got the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom, who had previously told them to wait until 18. The mom is upset, even though the user isn't sexually active and the implant is similar to the Depo shot they were already using. The user thinks the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom uses an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age and legal aspects. In many places, minors can make their own healthcare decisions, especially related to reproductive health. So the user might legally be allowed to get the implant without parental consent. But the mom is upset because she wanted to wait. The user's reasoning includes convenience and future work plans, which seems logical.\n\nHowever, the user didn't communicate with the mom, which might be a point of contention. Even if the user had the right to make the decision, not discussing it could hurt the mom. The mom might feel disrespected or not involved in the decision-making process. On the other hand, the user might feel that their autonomy is being restricted, especially since the mom's reasons for waiting aren't clear.\n\nAnother angle is the mom's reaction. She hung up, which is extreme, and is now researching and questioning the side effects, even though the user knows they're similar to Depo. The mom's inconsistency (using an IUD herself) might make her reaction seem hypocritical. The user argues that waiting until 18 wouldn't change much, so the timing might be trivial.\n\nBut the core issue is the lack of communication. The user made a decision that affects their health without telling the mom. Even if the user is right in their own eyes, not discussing it could be seen as a breach of trust. The mom might value shared decision-making, especially for a significant medical procedure. However, the user is of age where they might be expected to have some autonomy.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on cultural and familial norms. Legally, they might not be, but in terms of the relationship, not communicating could be a mistake. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the user is making an informed choice for their own health, but there's a case for A (in the wrong) due to the lack of communication. However, since the user's reasons are valid and the mom's reaction seems inconsistent, the community might lean towards B."
