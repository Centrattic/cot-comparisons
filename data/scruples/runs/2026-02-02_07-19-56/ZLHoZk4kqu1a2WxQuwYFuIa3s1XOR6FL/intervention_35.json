I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch their birth control to Nexplanon without their mom's knowledge. The mom had previously told them to wait until 18 and didn't want to discuss it. The author got the implant anyway, and the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So legally, the author might have the right to make this decision without parental consent. That's a key point because if they're allowed to, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The mom might feel it's her responsibility to be involved, even if the child is legally allowed to make their own choice. The author might see this as an overreaction, especially since they're not sexually active and the mom uses an IUD herself. But parents often have different views on what's appropriate, even if they agree on the method.\n\nThe author's reasoning for acting now (before starting full-time work) seems practical. However, the mom's concerns about research and side effects are valid. Even if the side effects are similar to the depo shot, the mom might feel it's her role to be informed and involved in her child's health decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom shut down the conversation initially and then reacted strongly after the fact. The author might feel their autonomy is being denied, which is a common issue for teenagers. The fact that the author isn't sexually active could make the mom's reaction seem unnecessary, but parents might still want to be involved regardless.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong legally or practically, but there's a conflict in expectations. The mom's reaction might be over the top, but the author could have handled it by explaining their decision or waiting a bit. However, since they had the legal right to make the decision, I lean towards them not being in the wrong. Still, there's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental concerns. The mom might need time to adjust, and open communication could help resolve this.\n"
