I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge. The mom wanted them to wait until they turn 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The author got the implant, and now the mom is upset, even though she's using an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent varies, but in many US states, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially reproductive health. So the author might have the legal right to make this decision. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe author mentions they're not sexually active and wanted something long-term. The mom's reasons for waiting are unclear; she just said to wait until 18. The author felt the implant was more convenient, especially since they'll be working more after 18. The mom is now upset, asking about side effects, which the author points out are similar to the Depo shot.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus parental guidance. At 17, the author is approaching adulthood and making a decision that affects their own body. The mom, while having her own method (IUD), might be projecting her own experiences or fears. However, the author didn't consult the mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the mom didn't provide a valid reason to wait beyond age, and the author's reasoning is practical.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author made an autonomous decision, which is important, but also didn't communicate with their parent, which is part of building trust. However, since the author has the legal right in many cases and the decision is about their own health, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The mom's overreaction might be the issue here. The answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
