I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is 17 and decided to switch their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom didn't want them to get it before 18 and got upset. The person thinks the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom has an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age for medical decisions. In many places, 18 is the age of majority, so maybe the mom feels she has the right to make decisions for a minor. But some places allow minors to consent to certain medical treatments, like birth control. So legally, maybe the person was allowed to make that decision.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust and communication. The person wanted to make their own choice without the mom's input. But the mom was clearly upset because they didn't ask or consult her. Even though the mom was dismissive before, the person might have thought they'd understand once they made the choice. However, not discussing it could have been hurtful, regardless of the legality.\n\nThe mom's reaction might stem from concern about side effects and the permanence of the implant. Since the person isn't sexually active, the mom might worry about future plans or health issues. But the person has their own reasons, like convenience and current work situation. \n\nThe fact that the mom has an IUD herself is interesting. Maybe she's being hypocritical, but that doesn't mean the person was in the wrong. It's more about the mom's reaction versus the person's right to make their own decisions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might not be in the wrong if they had the legal right to consent to the procedure. However, the lack of communication could be seen as a mistake, even if not wrong. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, if they did what they could legally do, then the answer would lean towards B (No). Also, the mom's reaction seems over the top, especially since the person has valid reasons and isn't being reckless. So the answer is probably B.\n"
