I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. The author is 17, got the Nexplanon implant without their mom's knowledge, and the mom is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author has the legal right to make this decision without parental consent. That's a point in their favor.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The mom initially told the author to wait until 18 but didn't engage in a discussion. The author might feel that they're capable of making this decision on their own, especially since they're not sexually active and it's for long-term convenience. But the mom's reaction is understandable because she's concerned and maybe wants to be involved in her child's health decisions.\n\nThe author's reasoning about convenience and future work plans is valid. They mention they'll be working full-time and the implant is less hassle. The mom's insistence on waiting three months might seem unnecessary if the author is capable now.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of trust and communication. The author didn't inform their mom until after the fact, leading to the mom feeling upset and disrespected. Even if the author had the right to make the decision, the lack of communication could strain their relationship. The mom might have wanted to discuss the decision, even if she was against it, to maintain a trusting relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their autonomy is important, especially regarding their own body. The mom's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially since she has her own birth control method. The author's point about not being sexually active might also reduce the urgency of the mom's concerns.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author may have the right to make the decision, but the way they went about it without communication might have been the wrong approach. However, depending on cultural and family norms, some might see the author as justified in asserting their independence. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the key issue is the breach of communication and trust, not the decision itself. So the answer might be A (yes) because the author acted without informing their mom, which could be seen as disrespectful, even if the decision was their right.\n"
