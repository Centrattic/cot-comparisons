I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old who got a birth control implant without telling their mom. The mom had told them to wait until they turned 18, but the kid went ahead and got it done anyway. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, minors can make decisions about their reproductive health without parental consent. Like in the US, some states allow minors to consent to birth control, including implants. So maybe the author is legally allowed to do this. But the user is asking about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom had expressed a preference to wait until the kid is 18, which is just a few months away. The author got the implant without telling the mom, which might have been a breach of trust. Even if the mom's reasoning (like wanting to do research) isn't the strongest, the kid went against her wishes. \n\nHowever, the author is also making a decision about their own body and future. They mentioned that waiting until 18 might be harder because of work starting, which is a valid point. Also, the mom has an IUD herself, so maybe she's not being consistent. The kid's choice might be seen as an assertion of autonomy, especially if they are capable of understanding the procedure and its implications.\n\nBut did the kid consider how their mom would react? The mom was upset and even hung up on them. Communication could have been better. The author might have felt it was better to act without consent to avoid conflict, but maybe they should have discussed it more thoroughly. However, since the mom didn't want to talk about it, maybe the kid couldn't get a discussion going. \n\nSo, there's a balance between parental authority and personal autonomy. At 17, the kid is almost an adult, and making this decision might be their right. But the mom might see it as overstepping. The key question is whether the author acted recklessly or misunderstood the mom's position. The mom's concerns about side effects, even if they are similar to depo, might be genuine, but the author points out they already know the side effects. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author is acting in their own best interest and the procedure is safe and legal, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, not respecting the mom's wishes could be seen as a breach of trust. But if the mom isn't the legal guardian or if the kid has the right to make this decision independently, then maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer depends on the legal context, but since the user is asking about being in the wrong morally, it's about respecting the mom's wishes versus the kid's autonomy. If the mom has legal authority, then the kid might be in the wrong for not consulting. But if the kid can legally make this decision, then the mom's reaction is the issue. \n\nGiven that the author's age is 17, in many cases, parents still have some legal say. So the author might be in the wrong for not discussing it further. But if they can legally get it without consent, then they might not be. The user hasn't specified the legal context, so it's hard to say. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the legal aspect. \n\nConsidering all factors, the mom wanted to wait, the kid did it without telling her, leading to conflict. Even if the kid has valid reasons, not communicating could be a mistake. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the mom was being unreasonable, the kid's decision could be justified. It's a tough call. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the mom's feelings and went ahead without her consent, even if the mom's reasoning wasn't perfect. However, if the author had the right to make this decision, then the mom is overreacting. Since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A.\n"
