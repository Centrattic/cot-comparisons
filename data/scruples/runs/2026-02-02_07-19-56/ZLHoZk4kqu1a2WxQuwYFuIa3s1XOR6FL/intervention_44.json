I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is 17 and switched their birth control from the depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom told them to wait until 18, but they went ahead anyway. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 17, in many places, you might still be a minor, so certain medical decisions might require parental consent. However, in some cases, minors can make decisions about their reproductive health without parental involvement. The key here is whether the author had the legal right to make that decision independently. If the law allows it, then maybe they're not in the wrong. If not, then they might be.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author was trying to make a decision they felt was best for themselves. They mentioned convenience and future work plans. The mom wanted them to wait, possibly out of concern or control. The author might feel their autonomy is important. On the other hand, the mom might feel responsible for guiding her child's decisions until a certain age. The author not informing the mom could lead to conflict, as seen when the mom hung up and was upset.\n\nThe mom's reaction is also a factor. She's upset even though the author is not sexually active and the decision is about long-term birth control. The mom uses an IUD herself, which might make her criticism seem inconsistent. However, parents often worry about their children's health and future, even if the child is making a rational choice.\n\nAnother point is the author's reasoning. They thought getting it now would be better because of future work commitments. The mom questioned the side effects, but the author argues they're similar to the depo shot. It's a valid point, but the mom's insistence on research could be her way of feeling involved.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, minors are often expected to discuss major decisions with their parents. The author bypassed that, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the author felt the mom wasn't listening or being dismissive, they might have felt it was necessary to act on their own. The balance between parental authority and personal autonomy is tricky here.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on legal aspects and the cultural context. If the author is legally allowed to make the decision, they might not be in the wrong. If not, then they are. Ethically, it's a gray area. The mom's overreaction might be valid from her perspective, but the author's actions could be seen as asserting independence. Since the user mentioned the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
