I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA situation. The user is 17 and decided to get the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom, who had previously said to wait until she turns 18. The mom hung up on her and is now upset, even though she forgot about it initially. The user argues that she's being responsible by getting it now, given her future work plans, and that her mom is overreacting, especially since the mom uses an IUD.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and parental rights in the US regarding minors and medical decisions. At 17, the user is still a minor, so parental consent is typically required for medical procedures. However, birth control is a sensitive area. In many states, minors can consent to their own birth control, including implants, without parental involvement. That might be a factor here.\n\nThe mom's argument is about waiting until 18, possibly because she wants to be involved in the decision. The user took initiative, but maybe without considering the mom's feelings. However, the user's reasoning about convenience and future work plans seems valid. Also, the mom's overreaction might be based on personal biases or lack of information.\n\nThe user did get the implant done without the mom's knowledge, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But if she's legally allowed to make that decision, it's her right. The mom's frustration might stem from feeling excluded or worried about side effects, even though the user points out they're similar to the Depo shot.\n\nConsidering all angles, the user acted in her own health interests, possibly within her legal rights, but the method of not informing the mom upfront could cause tension. However, the mom's reaction seems disproportionate given that the user is responsible and the procedure is safe. So, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
