I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch from the Depo shot to Nexplanon without telling her mom. The mom wanted her to wait until 18, but the author went ahead and got it done. The mom is upset, thinking the author shouldn't make this decision alone.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: In many places, minors can make their own healthcare decisions regarding contraception. So the author might legally be allowed to do this. But the question is about right and wrong, not just legality.\n\nThen, the relationship aspect. The mom wanted to discuss it and set a boundary (wait until 18). The author didn't communicate and went against the mom's initial instruction. Even if the mom is overreacting, the author didn't respect her parent's wishes. However, the author is an adult in some ways, making her own healthcare choices, especially if she's responsible and informed.\n\nThe mom's reasons: She wanted to wait until 18, maybe for the author's own good, to ensure she's making a mature decision. The author argues that waiting wouldn't make a big difference and she has valid reasons (work plans, healing time). But the mom felt the decision should be made together.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is seeking autonomy. She's not sexually active, so the immediate need isn't about immediate protection. But long-term planning is valid too. The mom's overreaction might be due to her own experiences (she has an IUD), but that doesn't justify the author's secrecy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She made a decision without discussing it further, even after the mom set a boundary. But she's making a responsible choice for herself. It's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental guidance. Since the mom was upset and the author didn't communicate, maybe there's fault on both sides. But the question is about the author specifically. If the author is old enough to make healthcare decisions, maybe she's not wrong. However, not considering the parent's feelings and the initial agreement could be seen as wrong. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on cultural or familial norms, but given the info, maybe the author is in the right. Wait, the initial mom's instruction was to wait until 18, so the author didn't follow that. But if the author can legally do it, then maybe she's not wrong. The question is about being in the wrong, not legal. So, maybe the author is not wrong because she made a decision for her own health, even though she didn't communicate. But she could have at least discussed it again. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she's making a responsible choice, but maybe partially in the wrong for not communicating better. However, the question is a yes/no. If the answer is A or B. If the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Given that the mom wanted to wait until 18, and the author didn't respect that, maybe A is correct. But if the author is allowed to make the decision regardless, then B. Since the author is 17 and in some places can make this decision, but the mom is upset because she wanted to discuss it. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
