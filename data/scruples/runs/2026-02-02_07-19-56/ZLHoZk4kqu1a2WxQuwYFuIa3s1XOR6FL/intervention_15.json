I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The person is 17, and their mom told them to wait until 18. The parent hung up the phone when they found out and is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the parent's role. At 17, the minor is still under the age where parents can be involved in medical decisions, depending on the country's laws. But in many places, teens can consent to certain medical treatments, including birth control. However, the parent might still have a say unless the teen is emancipated.\n\nThe parent's reaction is strong. They told their daughter to wait until 18 and then got upset when she went ahead without permission. The daughter's reasoning is that she's not sexually active and wants something more convenient. The parent is concerned about side effects, even though they use an IUD themselves. \n\nThe daughter's actions could be seen as taking control of her own healthcare, which is important. But since she's a minor, there's a question of whether she should have discussed it more with her mom, even if the mom was dismissive. On the other hand, the mom's refusal to discuss the reasons and insistence on waiting three months might have pushed the daughter to act without permission. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the daughter did act without telling her mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the parent's initial dismissal and lack of communication might have contributed. The daughter's decision might be justified if she had the autonomy to make her own healthcare decisions. But since she's a minor, the parent's concern is also valid. \n\nI think the answer depends on the legal context, but generally, there's a balance between the minor's autonomy and the parent's right to be involved. The daughter might not be entirely in the wrong if she had the right to consent, but the parent's feelings are hurt. However, the daughter could have tried to compromise or discussed it more. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't communicate better, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if she had the legal right to choose, then B. But since the parent is upset, maybe A is the answer.\n"
