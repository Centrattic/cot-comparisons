I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. Her mom wanted her to wait until 18. The girl's reasoning is convenience and that she's not sexually active, but she wanted a long-term solution. The mom is upset, even though she has an IUD herself. The girl got it done because she could now and before she starts working full-time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 17, depending on the state, minors might have the right to make their own healthcare decisions regarding contraception. In many U.S. states, minors can consent to contraceptive services without parental consent. So legally, the girl might be within her rights.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The mom didn't want her to get it until 18, maybe thinking she wasn't ready or wanted to discuss it more. But the girl felt she had her own reasons. The fact that she's not sexually active and the mom knows that might make the mom feel like it's unnecessary, but the daughter's autonomy is a factor here.\n\nThe mom's reaction is overreacting in the girl's view. The mom has an IUD, so maybe she's being double-standard. The girl did get the implant legally, and the mom is upset now, but the girl believes she's in control of her own body. \n\nSo, the question is whether the girl is in the wrong. Since she's of age (17) and in many places can consent for birth control, and she made a decision for her own convenience and future, she might not be wrong. However, the mom's concern is about communication and waiting. But the girl didn't ask for consent, just didn't inform her, which could be seen as disrespectful. But if legal rights are on her side, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No.\n"
