I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a 17-year-old) is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. The situation involves getting the Nexplanon implant without parental consent after the mom told them to wait until 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 17, the person is a minor in most places. In many jurisdictions, minors can consent to their own healthcare, especially related to reproductive health. So legally, the author might be within their rights to make this decision. But the mom is upset, so there's a conflict between the minor's autonomy and parental authority.\n\nNext, the context of why the author made the decision. They mentioned convenience and future plans, like working full-time. They also state they're not sexually active. The mom's reaction could stem from concern, even if she has an IUD herself. There's a possible inconsistency in her approach.\n\nThe mom's reasons for wanting to wait until 18 aren't clear. Maybe she wanted to discuss it more or felt the child wasn't ready. The author might have felt their autonomy was important, especially since the medical provider allowed it. However, not informing the mom could be seen as a lack of communication, which might be where the author is at fault if the mom expected to be involved in the decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's health and future are their own concern. They might have valid reasons to act now rather than wait. The side effects are similar to the Depo shot, so the mom's research might not be necessary. The author could argue they're making a responsible decision for their own health.\n\nSo the key points are legal rights, communication, and the mother's concerns versus the author's autonomy. The answer depends on whether the author respected the mom's wishes and the importance of communication. Since the mom had asked to wait, not discussing it further might be seen as going against her wishes, which could be where the author is in the wrong. But if the author had the right to consent independently, then they might not be in the wrong. The answer is a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A (yes) because they didn't communicate despite the mom's expressed wishes, even if the action was legally permissible."
