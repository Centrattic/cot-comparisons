I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. The author is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant instead of the Depo shot, which they were supposed to get. Their mom told them to wait until 18, but the author went ahead and got it done without the mom's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical aspects. At 17, depending on the jurisdiction, minors might have the right to make decisions about their own reproductive health without parental consent. For example, in the U.S., some states allow minors to consent to certain medical procedures, including birth control. So the author might have the legal right to make this decision.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that the mom told them to wait until 18 but didn't engage in a discussion. The author felt that their reasons (convenience, future work plans) weren't considered. The mom's reaction was to hang up and later express upsetness, asking about side effects, which the author points out are similar to Depo. The mom also has an IUD, which the author finds hypocritical. \n\nThe author is not sexually active, so the immediate health risks are lower, but they wanted a long-term solution. The mom's insistence on waiting 3 months might not have a solid reason beyond personal control or concern. The author's decision could be seen as proactive and responsible, considering their future plans.\n\nHowever, the author didn't communicate their decision-making process with their mom until after the fact, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if they had the legal right, the social aspect of parental involvement in a minor's health decisions can be a gray area. The mom might feel that trust was broken, especially if there was a prior agreement to wait.\n\nBut given that the author had valid reasons and the mom wasn't open to discussion, the author might feel they had no choice. Also, the mom's reaction of hanging up and not addressing the author's concerns could indicate a lack of communication. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often considers intent, communication, and whether there's a clear wrongdoer. Here, the author acted within their legal rights (assuming the jurisdiction allows it), made a responsible decision, and the mom's reaction seems more about control than the procedure itself. The author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer could lean towards B (No), but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the options are only A or B. Given that the author made a legal choice for their health and the mom's response is overreaching, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
