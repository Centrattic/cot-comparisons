I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it.

I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is 17 years old. They've been using the depo shot every three months. They wanted to switch to Nexplanon, an implant that lasts five years. They initially discussed this with their mom, who told them to wait until they turn 18, which is three months away. The mom didn't engage in a discussion about why they wanted it. The author went ahead and got the implant without their mom's consent during an appointment when the mom wasn't present. When they told their mom, she was upset, hung up, and later brought it up again. The mom is now researching and questioning the side effects, even though she has an IUD herself. The author argues that getting it now is more convenient before they start working full-time and that their mom is overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the age factor: 17 in the US is a minor, right? But birth control decisions can involve minors, and sometimes they can be done without parental consent depending on state laws. However, the mom is the one paying for the procedure, maybe? Or is the author independent? The question is whether the author overstepped by not discussing it further with their mom.\n\nThe mom's reaction is part of the issue. She wanted the author to wait until 18 and didn't engage in discussion. The author felt they needed to act now for practical reasons (healing time before work). The mom is upset, possibly because she wanted to be involved in the decision, even though she initially said to wait. The author might have felt they were making an autonomous decision, especially since they aren't sexually active now but want long-term protection.\n\nLegal aspects: In some states, minors can consent to birth control without parental involvement. So if that's the case, the author isn't breaking any laws. But the mom's emotional reaction is about feeling disrespected or not being consulted. The author might argue that the mom didn't take their reasons seriously, so taking action was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that even though she initially said to wait, the author should have respected that decision. The author made a choice that affects their body but also possibly the family dynamics, especially if the mom is the one covering costs or if there's a history of shared decision-making.\n\nThe key points are autonomy vs. parental authority. The author is trying to make an informed decision about their own health, but the mom is asserting her role as a parent. The author might not be in the wrong if they have the right to consent, but if the mom was involved in healthcare decisions up to this point, the author's unilateral action might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the mom's inconsistency: she has an IUD, which is similar to Nexplanon, but is against her daughter getting it. That might indicate hypocrisy, but the author's choice is still about their own body.\n\nIn terms of ethics, minors under 18 (in many places) can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So legally, the author might be okay. However, the social aspect is about family relationships and communication. The author's decision might be right in terms of their health needs but could be seen as wrong in terms of not respecting their mom's wishes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the author is legally allowed to make this decision, they might not be in the wrong. But if the mom is a guardian and typically involved in such decisions, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. The fact that the mom initially told the author to wait until 18 but the author went ahead anyway could be a point against the author. The author could have waited those three months, even if it's a short time, to show respect for the mom's initial instruction.\n"
