I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch her birth control method from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without her mom's consent. She told her mom about the implant before but was told to wait until she turns 18. Then she went ahead and got it done herself, leading to her mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, including birth control. So maybe she's allowed to make that decision without her mom. But the question isn't just about legality but about right and wrong in a social context.\n\nThe mom has a history of using an IUD herself, so maybe she's against the implant for her own reasons. The daughter argues that waiting until 18 could delay her plans and that the implant is more convenient. She's not sexually active, but birth control can be for other health reasons, like managing menstrual issues. \n\nHowever, the daughter didn't communicate her reasons clearly. She just went ahead without discussing them, which led to her mom's upset. The mom is worried about side effects and the decision-making process. Even though the mom might be overreacting, the daughter didn't let her have a say, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is making a choice about her own body. If she's old enough to understand the procedures and their implications, she might be within her rights. But since she's a minor in a parent-child relationship, there's an expectation of discussing important decisions with parents unless there's a legal right to privacy.\n\nThe key points are: legal rights to consent, the daughter's autonomy vs. parental authority, communication, and the mom's overreaction. It's a balance between respecting the daughter's choices and considering the parent's concerns. Since the daughter didn't communicate her reasons and acted unilaterally, she might be in the wrong for not being open with her mom, even if she had the right to make the decision herself.\n"
