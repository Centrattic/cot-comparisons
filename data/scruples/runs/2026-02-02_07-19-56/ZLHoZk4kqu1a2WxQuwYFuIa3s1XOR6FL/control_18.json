I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a 17-year-old) is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom had initially told them to wait until 18, and the author went ahead anyway.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. At 17, the author is a minor, so they might need parental consent for medical procedures. But in some places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. I'm not sure about the exact laws here. Maybe the clinic allowed the author to proceed because they can consent to birth control? That could be a factor.\n\nNext, the mom's perspective. She wanted the author to wait until 18, maybe because of legal authority or concern about the author making a hasty decision. She also mentioned researching the side effects, which might indicate she felt the author wasn't fully informed. However, the author argues that the side effects are similar to the Depo shot, so maybe the mom's concerns are unfounded. Also, the mom has an IUD, so she's using a long-term method herself, which the author points out as contradictory.\n\nThe author's reasoning: they wanted a more convenient method, aren't currently sexually active, and wanted to get it done before starting a full-time job that might make healing harder. These seem valid points. The mom's reaction seems to be more about authority and possibly overreaction rather than the medical decision itself.\n\nBut the key issue here is consent. If the author didn't need parental consent for this procedure, then they might not be in the wrong. If they did, then maybe they are. But given that the clinic allowed it, maybe the law allows minors to consent to such procedures. Also, the author was proactive in making a decision about their own body, which is a valid argument for their side.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be justified if they had the legal right to make the decision. The mom's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author's reasons are valid and they're not engaging in risky behavior. The mom's insistence on waiting until 18 without a solid reason might not be fair.\n"
