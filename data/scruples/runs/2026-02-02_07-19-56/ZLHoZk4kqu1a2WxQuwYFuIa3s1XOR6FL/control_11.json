I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to get the Nexplanon implant without her mom's knowledge. The mom had previously said to wait until she's 18. The daughter felt it was more convenient and practical now, considering her future work plans. The mom is upset, even though she has an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a minor, so legally, she might need parental consent for medical procedures. But she got the implant without her mom being present. Depending on the location, minors can sometimes consent to certain medical treatments, but birth control might be considered a parental consent issue.\n\nThe daughter's reasoning is that she wants something long-term and that her mom is overreacting, especially since she's not sexually active. However, the mom's concern might stem from wanting to be involved in her daughter's healthcare decisions. The daughter didn't explain her reasons well when they initially discussed it, which led to the mom being upset. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus parental authority. The daughter believes she's making a responsible decision for her health, while the mom feels it's her role to oversee such decisions until the daughter is 18. Legally, if the daughter couldn't consent on her own, then she might be in the wrong. But if she could, then maybe not. However, the situation also involves the emotional impact on the mom and the lack of communication. \n\nThe daughter didn't listen to her mom's initial refusal and went ahead anyway, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the medical procedure is legally permissible, the breach of trust and communication is a factor. The mom's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a natural response to not being involved in a significant decision about her child's health. \n\nSo, considering both the legal aspect and the relationship dynamics, the daughter might be in the wrong for not respecting her mom's initial stance and not communicating her reasons effectively. Even if she's legally allowed to make the decision, the way she handled it could have been better. However, there's also a case for her autonomy in healthcare decisions. But since the mom had expressed a clear preference, the daughter went against it, which complicates the situation.\n"
