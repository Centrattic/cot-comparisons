I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom initially told them to wait until they turned 18, but the author went ahead and got the implant anyway. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can make decisions about their own health care, especially regarding reproductive health. For example, in some states, teens can get birth control without parental consent. So legally, the author might have the right to do this. But it's important to check the specific laws of the area they're in. If they're in a place where parental consent isn't required for such procedures, then the author wasn't in the wrong legally.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The mom wanted the daughter to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The daughter felt that waiting would be inconvenient because she's planning to work full-time after turning 18, which might make healing harder. The daughter isn't sexually active, so maybe the urgency is about being prepared. However, the mom is upset because she thinks the daughter didn't respect her wishes. Even if the daughter had the legal right to make the decision, not communicating and acting unilaterally could be seen as disrespectful. The daughter did mention they tried to talk to their mom, but the mom wasn't receptive. Still, getting the implant without discussing further might have been a breach of trust.\n\nAnother point is that the mom has an IUD herself, so she might have had a different perspective. But the daughter's reasons for choosing Nexplanon might be valid. The daughter is making a decision about their own body, which is a significant consideration. However, the mom's concern about side effects (even if similar to Depo) is part of parental worry. The daughter might have not considered that the mom wanted to discuss the side effects more thoroughly, even if the daughter felt informed.\n\nIn terms of maturity, the daughter is 17 and about to be 18. They might be seen as capable of making their own decisions, especially regarding their health. The mom might feel that waiting until 18 would help the daughter gain more experience or maturity. But the daughter argues that the timing is practical. \n\nSo, balancing these factors: if the daughter had the legal right to make the decision, then they might not be in the wrong. However, ethically, not considering the mom's initial request could be seen as dismissive. But since the mom wasn't open to discussion and the daughter is making a choice for their own future, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is whether the daughter's actions were legally permissible and whether they acted respectfully despite the mom's initial stance. If they had the right and made a decision about their health, they might not be in the wrong. However, if there were legal requirements for parental consent that they bypassed, then maybe they are. But since the scenario doesn't mention legal issues, and the daughter got the implant, it's more about the ethical disagreement with the mom. Given that, I'm leaning towards the daughter not being in the wrong because they made a decision about their own body, even if it upset their mom.\n"
