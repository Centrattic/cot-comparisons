I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is at fault for switching birth control without telling her mom. The user is 17, got an implant without her mom's consent. Her mom wanted her to wait until 18. The key points here are about autonomy, the age of majority, and parental rights.\n\nFirst, the age is important. In many places, 18 is the age of majority, but some states allow minors to make medical decisions regarding reproductive health. So the author might have the legal right to make this choice. However, the mom is upset and thinks she should have waited. The author argues that the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom has an IUD herself. Also, the author isn't sexually active, so maybe the mom is being more controlling than necessary.\n\nBut then, even if the author has the legal right, there's the aspect of the parent-child relationship. The mom might feel she should have been consulted. The author did mention it to her mom, who responded by saying to wait until 18. The author went ahead anyway. Was the mom's response valid? If the mom said to wait, maybe the author should have respected that until the agreed time. But the author felt it was more convenient and considered the healing time for work reasons.\n\nThe author is not sexually active, so maybe the birth control choice isn't as urgent. But she might still have the right to choose her method. The mom is upset about the decision without considering her daughter's reasoning. The side effects were similar to Depo, so maybe the mom's research is a way to delay or prevent the decision.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, minors often have some autonomy, especially in health decisions. But parents usually have the final say until the child reaches majority. However, if the parent is being unreasonable, the child might feel justified in making the choice. The answer could depend on cultural norms and specific laws, but generally, if the author has the legal right, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if the mom had already set a boundary by saying to wait until 18, maybe the author didn't respect that, making her partially at fault. But the mom's reaction seems harsh, given the circumstances. The author's reasoning about work and convenience is valid. The mom's concern about side effects might be a red herring. Since the author is not sexually active, the urgency is less. But she still has the right to make her own healthcare decisions. So overall, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
