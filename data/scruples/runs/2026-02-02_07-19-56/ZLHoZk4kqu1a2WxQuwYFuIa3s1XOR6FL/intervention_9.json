I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to switch birth control from the depo shot to Nexplanon without informing her mom. Her mom wanted her to wait until 18, but she went ahead and got it done. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So the author might have the legal right to make this decision. However, the mom might still feel responsible for making decisions on her behalf, even if the law allows it. \n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author didn't discuss this with her mom, which could be a point of contention. Even if the mom was dismissive, cutting her out of the process entirely might have been hurtful. The author mentions that the mom had an IUD, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's more informed or that her opinion isn't valid. \n\nThe motivation here is convenience and future planning. The author isn't sexually active, which might make the choice seem less urgent, but she still has her reasons. The mom's reaction includes wanting to do research and questioning the side effects, which suggests she's not just being overprotective but genuinely concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a minor and might be seeking autonomy. The mom's stance on waiting until 18 could be about responsibility and understanding the consequences. However, the author did get the procedure done legally, and the mom's upset reaction after the fact might indicate a lack of trust or communication issues in their relationship.\n\nSo, considering legal rights and the author's autonomy versus the mom's protective role, it's a bit of a gray area. The author acted within her legal rights but may have breached the trust or expectations of her mom. The key issue is communication and respecting parental concerns, even if the decision is ultimately the minor's to make.\n"
