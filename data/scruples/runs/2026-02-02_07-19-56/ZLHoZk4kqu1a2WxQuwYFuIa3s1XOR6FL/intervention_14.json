I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom initially told them to wait until they turn 18, which is three months away. The user went ahead and got the implant done, and now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 17, the user is a minor, so they typically can't make medical decisions on their own without parental consent. But there's an exception for certain medical services related to reproductive health. In many places, minors can consent to birth control without parental involvement. So maybe the user had the right to make this decision independently.\n\nNext, the mom's reaction. She wanted the user to wait until 18 and didn't engage in a discussion about the reasons. The user felt dismissed and decided to act without her. The mom now is upset and wants to research the side effects, which the user thinks are similar to the Depo shot. Also, the user is not sexually active, so the urgency might not be about immediate sexual activity but personal preference for a long-term solution.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they want to get the implant now before starting a full-time job that might make arm healing harder. The mom's argument is about waiting until 18, but the user feels it's their own body. However, the mom is the parent and might feel responsible for making decisions for a minor.\n\nBut laws vary by location. If in their state the user can legally consent to the implant without parental approval, then the user isn't in the wrong. However, if parental consent is required, then the user might be in the wrong for not getting approval. The user also mentions the mom has an IUD, which might be a point to consider\u2014why the double standard?\n\nEmotionally, the user might feel mature enough to make this decision, but the mom might feel protective. The user's decision could be seen as taking initiative, but they might have ignored the mom's initial instruction. The key here is whether the law allows minors to consent to this procedure. If yes, then the user isn't in the wrong. If not, then they might be. But without knowing the specific laws, it's tricky. However, many places do allow minors to consent to birth control. So maybe the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
