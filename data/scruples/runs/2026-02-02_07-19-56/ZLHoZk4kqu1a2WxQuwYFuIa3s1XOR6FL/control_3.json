I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for switching birth control without telling her mom. The situation is that the author is 17, got the Nexplanon implant without her mom's consent, and her mom is upset. The author argues she's not sexually active, the procedure is safe, and her mom's reaction is over the top.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So the author might have the legal right to make this decision. But laws vary by location, so if the user is in a place where parental consent is required, maybe the author is in the wrong. But since the mom agreed to Depo every three months before, maybe she's given prior consent for contraceptive decisions, making Nexplanon a similar choice.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels she's old enough to make her own decisions, especially regarding her body. The mom didn't engage in a discussion about why the author wanted Nexplanon, just dismissed it. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014waiting might be harder when starting a job. Also, not being sexually active is relevant because the birth control isn't for immediate use. The mom's argument about side effects seems weak since Depo has similar ones.\n\nBut the mom is upset because she wanted to do research. Maybe she feels her role as a parent is being undermined. However, if the author is capable of understanding the procedure and its implications, especially for a long-term method, she might be responsible enough. The fact that the mom had an IUD herself could imply she's aware of the procedure's safety.\n\nThe key points are consent laws, the mother's prior approval for birth control, the daughter's maturity in making an informed decision, and the mother's reaction being overly restrictive without valid reasons. If the author had the legal and medical right to decide, then she's not in the wrong. If not, maybe she is. But given the context, it seems the author acted responsibly, and the mom's reaction is more about control than safety concerns. So the answer is B.\n"
