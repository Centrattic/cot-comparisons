I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The author is 17, and her mom wanted her to wait until 18. The mom didn't discuss the reasons for the wait, just said to hold off. The author decided to get the implant without her mom's permission, and now the mom is upset. The author argues that the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom herself has an IUD and the author isn't sexually active. She also mentions that the timing difference between now and 18 isn't significant because she's about to start working more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 17, in many places, the author might still be a minor, which could mean her parent has certain rights regarding medical decisions. However, in some cases, minors can consent to certain medical procedures, especially related to reproductive health. It depends on the jurisdiction. But maybe the question is more about ethics rather than legality.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author made a decision that her parent didn't agree with. The parent wanted to wait three months, possibly for reasons related to maturity, the author's ability to understand the procedure, or other factors. The author might feel that her autonomy should be respected, but the parent likely sees themselves as the authority figure who should be involved in such decisions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the mom is overreacting, but the mom might feel that she's trying to protect her daughter. The fact that the author isn't sexually active could be a point in her favor, but the parent might still prefer to make the decision. Also, the parent's initial refusal might have been a way to encourage a discussion or to ensure the author is making an informed decision. The author didn't give her mom the chance to discuss the reasons for her choice, which could have led to understanding or compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be asserting her right to make her own healthcare decisions, especially since she's close to 18 and the procedure is long-term. The parent's reaction of hanging up and being upset could indicate a breakdown in communication. The author's actions might be seen as a rebellion against parental control, but maybe she felt her autonomy was being unfairly restricted.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong if the parent expected to be involved in the decision-making process. However, if the author had the legal right to make the decision and the parent was being overly controlling, then she might not be in the wrong. Since the situation is in the US (assuming AITA is from Reddit's AITA forum), there are some states where minors can consent to certain medical procedures. But without specific info on the jurisdiction, it's hard to say. Ethically, the author's choice could be seen as asserting independence, but it's also possible that the parent had valid reasons for wanting to discuss it more. The author didn't give her mom the chance to engage in that discussion, which could be a point of contention. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced.\n"
