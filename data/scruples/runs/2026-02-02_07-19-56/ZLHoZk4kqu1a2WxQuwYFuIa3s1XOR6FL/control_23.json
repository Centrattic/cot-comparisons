I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a birth control implant without telling her mom. The author is 17, got the Nexplanon implant without her mom's consent, and the mom is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author had the right to make that decision. But the mom might still be upset because she expected to be involved.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom told the author to wait until 18, but the author went ahead. The mom might feel disrespected or that her authority is being ignored. But the author argues that waiting until 18 would be inconvenient because of future work plans. Also, the mom has an IUD herself, which seems contradictory.\n\nThe author isn't sexually active, so maybe the mom's concern is more about control or misunderstanding the procedure. The author might feel her autonomy is important, especially for long-term health decisions. \n\nBut there's also the fact that the mom was initially not supportive and didn't engage in a discussion. The author might have felt she wasn't being heard, leading her to make the decision independently. \n\nIs there a cultural or situational factor I'm missing? Maybe the mom's reaction is over the top, but does that make the author right? The author could have tried to communicate more, but the mom wasn't listening. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often mutual responsibility. The author made a choice without consent, which could be seen as wrong, but the mom's refusal to discuss might also be part of the issue. However, the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that minors can consent to birth control in many cases, the author might be justified. But the act of not informing the mom could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the mom was the one who shut down the conversation, maybe the author had a reason to proceed. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, as she made a medical decision that she had the right to, even if the communication wasn't ideal. The mom's overreaction and lack of support might shift the blame more towards her. So the answer is B.\n"
