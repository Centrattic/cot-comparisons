I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it.

I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 17 and has been using the Depo shot every three months. They wanted to switch to Nexplanon, an implant that lasts five years, for convenience. They mentioned it to their mom, who told them to wait until they're 18 and didn't discuss the reasons. The kid went ahead and got the implant without their mom's consent, and now the mom is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the legal age for medical decisions, the mother's role in the child's healthcare, and the child's autonomy. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So the author might be legally allowed to make this decision on their own. However, the mother might still be upset because she feels she should have a say, even if she's not the legal guardian in that specific case.\n\nThe author argues that the timing difference between now and 18 isn't significant, especially since they're not sexually active and the implant is more convenient. The mother is upset about not being involved and questions the decision-making. The author's reasoning is practical, considering future work and healing time.\n\nBut the mother might feel disrespected or not informed. Even if the law allows the minor to make the decision, the mother might value communication and being part of the process. The author didn't wait for the mother to \"research\" or discuss further, which the mother found upsetting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult in the making, approaching 18, and making decisions about their own body. The mother has an IUD herself, so maybe she doesn't see the issue in her child having similar control. The author's autonomy is a factor here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between legal rights, parental involvement, and the child's autonomy. If the author could legally consent, then they're not in the wrong. But if the mother had a role in medical decisions (depending on local laws), then the author might be wrong. However, in many cases, minors can consent to birth control without parental consent, especially in the U.S. So the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way they went about it without discussing further could have been a better approach to avoid hurting the mother's feelings. The answer might depend on local laws, but generally, the author isn't in the wrong if they had the legal right to make the decision. But if the mother is the legal guardian and had a say in this, then maybe the author is. But given that the author is 17 and close to 18, and the implant is a longer-term solution, it's possible the author is justified in wanting to make the decision now. The mother's reaction might be more about feeling excluded rather than legal rights. So the answer could be B, not in the wrong, but there's nuance.\n"
