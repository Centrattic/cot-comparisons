I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it.

I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for switching their birth control without telling their mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, and they were supposed to get the Depo shot every three months. They wanted to switch to Nexplanon, which lasts five years, for convenience. They talked to their mom, but she told them to wait until they turn 18 and didn't discuss why. The author then went ahead and got the implant without their mom's knowledge. Their mom was upset, hung up, and later expressed concerns about the decision. The author argues that waiting until 18 wouldn't make much difference, especially since they'll be working more then, and that their mom is overreacting despite having an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, I should consider legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical procedures without parental consent, especially related to reproductive health. However, this can vary by state or country. If the author is in a jurisdiction where they can legally consent to birth control, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if not, then maybe they are.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The mom might feel that since she's a parent, she should be involved in her child's healthcare decisions, especially if there are potential side effects. The author might feel it's their right to make personal health choices, especially since they're not sexually active but want a long-term solution. However, the author didn't consider their mom's perspective and went ahead without discussing further, which could lead to trust issues.\n\nThe mom's reaction could be due to wanting to protect her child, even if her reasons seem unclear. She might be worried about the implant's side effects, the procedure itself, or maybe just not wanting her child to make a long-term decision at 17. The author's argument about waiting until 18 is valid in terms of practicality (work, healing), but the mom might see the decision as premature or not needing to be made now.\n\nThe key points here are consent laws, the importance of communication, and the balance between a parent's right to guide and a minor's right to autonomy. If the author could legally make the decision, then the action might be justified. However, acting without informing the parent could still be seen as disrespectful, even if legally permissible. On the other hand, if the author felt their mom was being dismissive without good reason, they might have a point in making their own choice.\n\nI need to check if the author is in a place where minors can consent to birth control. If yes, then they're not in the wrong legally, but maybe ethically, they should have communicated better. If not, then they are in the wrong. Since the example scenario doesn't specify location, but in the US, in some states minors can consent to birth control. So assuming that's the case here, the author might be in the right. However, the act of going behind the parent's back and the mom's subsequent upset could still be an issue in terms of family dynamics.\n\nAlternatively, even if legally allowed, the author's decision could be seen as a breach of trust if the parent expected to be involved. The mom's upset might be more about the decision-making process rather than the decision itself. The author's justification about convenience and future work plans is valid, but maybe the mom wanted to discuss it more to understand her child's reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author was legally allowed to make that decision, they might not be in the wrong. However, the lack of communication and the mom's reaction suggest that there's a conflict in expectations. The answer depends on the legal context, but since the user hasn't provided that, I have to consider the general case. In many places, minors can consent, so the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a case to be made for both sides depending on the situation.\n"
