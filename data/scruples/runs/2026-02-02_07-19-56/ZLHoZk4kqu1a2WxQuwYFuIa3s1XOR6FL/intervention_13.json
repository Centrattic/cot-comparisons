I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The author is 17, and her mom wanted her to wait until 18. She got the implant without her mom's consent, and now the mom is upset. The author argues that her mom is overreacting, especially since the mom has an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical aspects. In many places, minors can make their own medical decisions regarding reproductive health without parental consent. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might be within her rights. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally.\n\nThe author mentions she's not sexually active, but she wants long-term contraception. Her mom's main concerns seem to be about the author making the decision without her and the timing (waiting until 18). The author might feel that her autonomy is important, especially since the procedure is safe and she's responsible enough to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that as a parent, she has a right to be involved in major health decisions for her minor child. Even if the author is legally allowed to make the choice, the mom might feel disrespected or that the author isn't considering her parental role. The mom's reaction of hanging up and being upset could stem from feeling that her wishes were ignored.\n\nThe author also points out that her mom has an IUD, which could imply hypocrisy. However, parents might have different perspectives on their own choices versus their children's. The mom might have different reasons for her own contraception that don't apply to her daughter.\n\nThe key points here are the author's autonomy versus the mom's parental concerns. The author made a decision she felt was best for herself, while the mom wanted to be involved. The author might not be in the wrong because she's making a personal health decision, but the mom's feelings are valid too. However, considering the author's age and the fact that she's seeking long-term contraception without being sexually active, maybe she's overstepping. Wait, no, the decision is about her own body. In many cases, minors can consent to contraception without parental involvement. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The mom's reaction is about control rather than the procedure itself. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
