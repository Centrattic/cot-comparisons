I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 17, depending on the country, the person might not be a legal adult yet. In places like the US, the age of majority is 18, so at 17, they might still be under their parent's legal guardianship. However, healthcare decisions can be complicated. Some states have emancipated minor laws or allow minors to consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. If that's the case here, the author might have had the right to make the decision.\n\nNext, the mom's perspective. She told the daughter to wait until 18. The daughter felt dismissed and decided to proceed without her mom's approval. The mom reacted strongly, even hanging up the phone. The daughter's reasoning was about convenience and her future work schedule. The mom is upset and wants to research more, but the daughter feels the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom uses an IUD herself.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between a minor's autonomy and parental rights. The daughter is making a decision about her own body, which is a significant point. However, parents generally have a right to be involved in their child's healthcare decisions. The daughter might have thought that since she's not sexually active and the method is long-term, it's a personal choice. But the mom might see it as something she should have been part of.\n\nThe daughter's actions could be seen as responsible if she's making an informed decision for her future. But legally, if her mom is the guardian, she might have had the right to be involved. However, if the daughter can consent on her own, then she might be justified. The key here is the legal age and consent laws in their jurisdiction.\n\nSince the user is asking for a yes or no, but the situation is nuanced. The answer might depend on the legal context. But without knowing the specific laws, I have to make a general assessment. In many cases, parents expect to be involved in such decisions for minors. The daughter acted without informing her mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if legally she could have done it. Emotionally, the mom's reaction is strong, and the daughter's choice might have been impulsive despite her reasoning.\n\nSo, considering the parent's role in a minor's healthcare and the potential for a breach of trust, the daughter might be in the wrong in the eyes of some, but others might side with her autonomy. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes) or B (no). Given the parent's perspective and the typical expectations, maybe A is more likely.\n"
