I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and decided to get the Nexplanon implant without their mom's consent. The mom had previously told them to wait until 18, but the user went ahead anyway. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, the user is a minor, so parental consent laws might apply here. Depending on the location, minors might need parental consent for certain medical procedures. If the user got the implant without it, they might have broken the law, which would make them wrong. But some places allow minors to consent to birth control without parental approval. Need to check that.\n\nSecond, the mom's reaction. She asked them to wait, and then got upset when they didn't. The user could argue that they're responsible with their health and not sexually active, so the mom's concern is unfounded. But parents often have authority over their minors' decisions, even if the child is mature. The user might be wrong for not respecting their mom's wishes.\n\nThird, the user's reasons. They wanted to avoid future work that might affect healing. That's a valid point, but maybe the mom could have been involved in the decision. The user also mentions the mom uses an IUD herself, so maybe she's being inconsistent.\n\nBut the core issue is consent and autonomy. If the user is a minor and needed parental consent, they violated that. If not, then they acted within their rights. The answer depends on legal aspects, but since the scenario doesn't specify the location, it's better to consider general perspectives. In many places, minors can consent to birth control, so maybe the user isn't in the wrong. However, the mom's feelings and the breach of trust might still make the user at fault in terms of communication and respecting parental wishes.\n\nSo, the user might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might have done something wrong by not communicating and respecting their mom's initial request. But since the user is acting in their own health interests and the mom's reaction seems inconsistent, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the user needed consent and didn't get it, then A (in the wrong). Since the question is about being in the wrong in terms of the situation, not legally, the answer is probably B, because the user made a personal health decision which they have the right to, given that they're a minor with some autonomy over their reproductive health. The mom's overreaction is part of the context.\n"
