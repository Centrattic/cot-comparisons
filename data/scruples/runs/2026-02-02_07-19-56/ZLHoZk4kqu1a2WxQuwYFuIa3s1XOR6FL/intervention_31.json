I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. So the situation is about a 17-year-old who decided to get a contraceptive implant without telling their mom. The mom had previously told them to wait until they turn 18, but the author went ahead anyway and the mom was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent for medical decisions. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author had the legal right to make this decision independently. However, there's also the aspect of parental consent. Depending on the location and specific laws, some procedures might require parental consent. If the implant requires parental consent and the author didn't get it, that could be an issue. But if they don't need it, then maybe the author was within their rights.\n\nNext, the relationship between the author and their mom. The mom had already expressed a wish to wait until 18, but the author felt the implant was more convenient. The mom is upset, even though she has an IUD herself. The author might feel that their autonomy is being respected. On the other hand, the mom might see it as a breach of trust and not following through on her earlier advice.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes factors like current work status (not working full-time now vs. after turning 18) and wanting a more permanent solution. They also mention not being sexually active, which might be a point in their favor. However, the mom is concerned about side effects and wants to do research, which could be seen as a valid concern even if the author disagrees.\n\nConsidering autonomy vs. parental rights: At 17, the author is almost an adult. In some states, minors can consent to birth control without parental consent. If that's the case here, the author is legally okay. However, the emotional and relational impact is another layer. The mom might feel disrespected or that her wishes were ignored, which could strain their relationship.\n\nSo, if the author was legally allowed to make the decision, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they needed parental consent and didn't get it, then they might be. However, the question is more about moral/ethical wrong rather than legal. The author might have felt their autonomy was important, but the mom's feelings are also valid. It's a tough balance between self-determination and respecting parental authority. Depending on the cultural context and specific laws, the answer could vary. But since the user is asking from an ethical standpoint, it's about whether the author overstepped by not discussing it further or getting consent when required.\n"
