I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without her mom's consent is in the wrong. The situation involves a teenager making a medical decision independently, which the mom is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age for medical decisions. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So, depending on the jurisdiction, the girl might legally be able to make this decision. However, the mom might have co-signed or be the legal guardian, which could complicate things if there's a conflict.\n\nThe girl had been discussing an implant with her mom, who told her to wait until 18. But the girl went ahead without asking again. The mom's reaction is anger and confusion. The girl argues that her mom is overreacting, especially since she's not sexually active and just wants a long-term solution.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, parental rights, and the legality of the decision. The girl is making a choice about her body, which is a strong argument for her side. However, the mom might feel that she has a right to be involved in her daughter's medical decisions, especially with something as significant as a long-term contraceptive implant.\n\nBut in many U.S. states, minors can consent to contraceptive care. So legally, the girl might be within her rights. However, the mom's feelings and the relationship dynamics are important too. The girl didn't respect her mom's initial instruction to wait until 18, even if the mom didn't enforce it. The girl might have acted impulsively without considering the mom's perspective, even if her mom's reasons were unclear.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl is 17, almost 18, and making a decision about her own body. The mom has an IUD herself, which is a similar method, so her objection might be inconsistent. The girl's reasoning about convenience and future plans (like working and needing recovery time) is valid.\n\nSo, is the girl in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. Legally, maybe she's fine, but ethically, she might have been wrong to not discuss it further with her mom, even if the mom was being dismissive. The situation shows a lack of communication and respect for her mom's initial request. Even if the mom was overreacting, the girl could have found a better way to address her concerns without going behind her back.\n"
