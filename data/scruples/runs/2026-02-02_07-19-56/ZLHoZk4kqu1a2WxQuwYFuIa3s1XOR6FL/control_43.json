      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the 17-year-old is in the wrong for getting a birth control implant without telling her mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girl is 17, which is under 18. She was supposed to get a Depo shot every three months. She wanted to switch to Nexplanon, which lasts five years. She discussed it with her mom, who told her to wait until she's 18. The mom didn't engage in a discussion about her reasons. The girl then went ahead and got the implant without her mom's consent, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nNow, in the US, the legal age of majority is 18. However, minors can sometimes make medical decisions related to reproductive health without parental consent, depending on state laws. For example, in some states, teens can obtain birth control without parental knowledge or consent. So from a legal standpoint, the girl might be within her rights.\n\nParental perspective: The mom might feel she's overstepping because she wanted to wait until the girl was 18. Maybe the mom was trying to maintain some control over her daughter's healthcare decisions until she's an adult. The mom might also be worried about the long-term commitment of Nexplanon versus the Depo shot, even though the girl explained her reasons (like convenience and current ability to heal without working full-time).\n\nThe girl's reasoning is that she's not sexually active, but she wants long-term control. The mom has an IUD herself, which might make her question why she's upset about her daughter's choice. The mom's reaction seems to be based on wanting to make decisions for her daughter, even though the girl is making an informed choice.\n\nEthically, the girl is making a decision about her own body. However, since she's a minor, there's a balance between her autonomy and the parent's responsibility to protect. If the girl is old enough to understand the medical implications and the procedure, some might argue she should have the right to decide. Others might say that since she's under 18, the parent has a role in such decisions, especially if there's a conflict.\n\nThe girl didn't involve her mom, which could be seen as disrespectful, but the mom wasn't open to discussion. The girl might feel that waiting three months would have been unnecessary since she's already planning to get it. The mom's reaction of hanging up and being upset might be more about feeling disrespected than the medical decision itself.\n\nSo, considering legal rights and the balance of autonomy vs. parental control, the answer could lean towards the girl not being in the wrong. However, there's a case for her being in the wrong because she didn't involve her mom despite the mom's initial stance. But the mom's refusal to engage in the discussion might have left the girl feeling she had no choice. I think the girl is not in the wrong here.\n"
