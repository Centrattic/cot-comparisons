I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who got the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom, who had previously said to wait until they turn 18. The author thinks the mom is overreacting and wants to know if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, minors can make medical decisions related to reproductive health without parental consent. For example, in the U.S., laws vary by state, but often teens can consent to contraceptive treatments. So legally, the author might be within their rights. \n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom had asked them to wait until 18, which the author didn't follow. The mom is upset because they went ahead without discussing it properly. The author argues that they were not sexually active, which is a valid point, but that doesn't negate the importance of communication. The mom's reaction might stem from wanting to protect her child, even if she herself uses an IUD.\n\nThe author's reasoning for getting it now includes future work plans and convenience. While practical, the decision to proceed without telling the mom could be seen as disrespectful to her wishes. Even if the mom was dismissive initially, there's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental guidance, especially when the parent is involved in medical decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a life decision about their body and future, which is their right. The mom's refusal to engage in the discussion might be part of the issue. The author might feel that their autonomy is being denied, so acting on their own could be a way to take control.\n\nI need to consider cultural and familial norms. Some parents expect to be involved in major medical decisions for their children, especially if they've been paying for the care. The author didn't consult the mom, which might be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the parent's initial response was dismissive without discussion, the author might feel justified in making the decision themselves.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent was to take control of their health, but the impact was causing upset to the mom. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line by not communicating better, even if they had the right to make the decision.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mom's wishes were valid in this case. Since the author could legally make the decision, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, not communicating with the mom, even if she was being dismissive, might be seen as rude. But given that the author is asserting their autonomy in a situation where the parent wasn't helpful, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions might be justified, but there's room for both perspectives. Given the legal stance and the author's reasoning, I'm leaning towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
