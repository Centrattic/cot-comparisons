I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The mom wanted her to wait until 18, but the daughter went ahead and got it. Now the mom is upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age for medical decisions. In many places, minors can make their own healthcare decisions regarding contraception. The daughter is 17, and even if she's under 18, depending on the state, she might be able to consent for herself. The mom tried to stop her, but maybe the daughter could legally get it without parental consent.\n\nThe daughter mentioned she's not sexually active and wanted a long-term solution. The mom is upset about the side effects, but the daughter says they're similar to the Depo shot. The mom has her own IUD, so maybe her reaction is inconsistent. However, parents might still have concerns regardless of their own choices.\n\nThe daughter didn't communicate her decision until after the fact, which could be seen as disrespectful. But if she had the legal right to make the decision, maybe the mom overreacted. On the other hand, parents often expect some level of communication with their teens, especially about health decisions. The daughter's reasoning about not being able to get it later because of work seems valid, but the mom might still feel disrespected.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the laws in their location. If the daughter could legally do it without consent, then she's not wrong. If she's under 18 and required to inform parents, maybe she is. But since the mom had already agreed to the Depo shot, and the daughter was seeking a more long-term solution, maybe the daughter isn't in the wrong. Also, the mom's reaction seems a bit hypocritical given her own contraceptive use. However, the daughter didn't discuss it further and went ahead, which could be seen as dismissive of her mom's concerns. But if the law allows it, then it's a matter of the daughter's autonomy versus parental control. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she made a legal, informed decision for her own health, even if the communication could have been better.\n"
