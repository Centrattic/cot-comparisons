I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is 17 and decided to switch from the Depo shot to the Nexplanon implant without telling their mom. The mom initially told them to wait until they turn 18. The author went ahead, got the implant, and now the mom is upset. The author is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. At 17, in many places, minors can make their own medical decisions, especially regarding contraception. But it might depend on local laws. However, the mom was involved in previous decisions, like the Depo shot, so maybe there's an expectation of parental involvement here.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. The author didn't communicate their decision to the mom. The mom felt disrespected and overreacted by hanging up. The author might argue they have autonomy, especially since they're not sexually active and the choice is about their body. But the mom's concern could stem from wanting to be involved in her daughter's healthcare decisions.\n\nThe author did mention the implant before, and the mom wanted them to wait. The author might have felt that waiting three months wasn't necessary, especially since they were planning to work full-time and might not have the same free time later. But the mom might feel that the author didn't respect her decision to wait.\n\nAlso, the mom has an IUD herself, so the author is confused why she's against the implant. It's possible the mom has her own reasons, maybe not wanting the author to go through the same process or different experiences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author made a decision based on their own needs and circumstances. However, they could have considered their mom's perspective and tried to involve her more, even if they disagreed. There's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental wishes, especially when the parent is actively involved in medical decisions.\n\nThe author's actions might not be legally wrong, but ethically, it's about communication and respect. The mom might feel betrayed, and the author might feel their autonomy was respected. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here where both sides have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author acted on their own decision without considering the mom's wishes, even if the mom's reasoning is unclear, there's a case for the author being in the wrong. However, the author also has the right to make medical decisions. It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is choosing their own healthcare, but some might argue they should have respected their mom's initial request to wait. But the mom didn't set a rule about not discussing it; she just said to wait until 18. The author might have thought that getting it now was more efficient. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check legal stuff again. In some places, minors can consent to contraception without parental involvement, so the author might have the right. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
