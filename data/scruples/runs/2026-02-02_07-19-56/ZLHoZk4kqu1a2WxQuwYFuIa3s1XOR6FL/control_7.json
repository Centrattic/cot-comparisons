I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person is 17 and wanted to switch from the depo shot to the Nexplanon implant. They asked their mom, who said to wait until they're 18. The author went ahead and got the implant without telling their mom. Now the mom is upset, hung up the phone, and is researching the side effects. The author thinks the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom has an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, legal stuff: At 17, are they considered a minor? In most places, yes, the age of majority is 18. So medical decisions for minors usually require parental consent unless there's an exception. For birth control, some states allow minors to consent to contraceptive services. But if the mom was supposed to be involved and the author bypassed her, that might be an issue legally and relationally.\n\nThe mom's reaction: She wanted the author to wait until 18. Maybe she thought the author was too young or not mature enough. The author argues they're responsible, not sexually active, and the procedure is similar to the depo shot. The mom might be worried about side effects or not trusting the author's decision-making.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they should have autonomy over their body. However, since they're a minor, parents typically have a role in medical decisions. The author made a choice without parental input, which could be seen as disrespectful or a breach of trust. The mom's upset reaction could stem from feeling disrespected or worried about the author's health.\n\nBut the author also mentions they're not sexually active and are planning for long-term. The mom's reasoning for waiting is unclear. Since the author is making a responsible decision, maybe the mom's objections are not well-founded. However, the method of bypassing the mom might still be problematic.\n\nIn terms of medical consent, if the clinic allowed the procedure without parental consent for a minor, maybe there's a legal gray area. But if parental consent is required and they didn't get it, then the author might be in the wrong. However, some places allow minors to consent to contraception, which could absolve the author.\n\nSo, considering all factors: The author made a decision they believed was best for them, but bypassed parental consent. If consent wasn't required, maybe they're not wrong. If it was required, they might be. Since the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author might have acted out of autonomy but could be seen as disregarding parental guidance. The mom's overreaction is questionable, but the author's actions might not be entirely their fault if consent wasn't needed. But since the mom's intent was to wait until 18, the author going against that without discussion could be seen as wrong. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). Hmm. I think leaning towards B (No) if consent was allowed, or A if not. Since the exact laws vary, but in many places minors can consent to birth control, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mom's reaction is more about control than the author's actions. So the answer could be B.\n"
