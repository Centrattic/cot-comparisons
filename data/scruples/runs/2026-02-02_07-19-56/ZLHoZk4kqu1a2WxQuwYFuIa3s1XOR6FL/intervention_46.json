I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 17-year-old who switched their birth control from Depo-Provera to Nexplanon without their mom's consent. The mom wanted them to wait until 18 and didn't discuss the reasons, but the author went ahead and got the implant done. Now the mom is upset, and the author is questioning if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent for medical procedures. In many places, minors can consent to their own medical care, especially for things like birth control. If that's the case, the author might not be wrong because they had the legal right to make that decision. However, if they were under 18 and couldn't consent, then they might be in the wrong. But the question is whether they're wrong in the context of the situation, not just legally.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author mentioned they talked to their mom, who said to wait until 18. The author went ahead anyway. The mom was upset because she thought she was being defied. The author argues that the procedure was safe and they wanted to be proactive, especially since they'll be working more after 18. Also, the mom has an IUD, which the author finds hypocritical.\n\nBut the mom's reaction could stem from concern, even if she didn't fully explain her reasons. Maybe she had valid concerns about the implant's side effects or wanted to be involved in the decision-making process. The author didn't wait for the mom's approval, which could be seen as disrespectful, even if the author had the right to make the decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a decision about their own body, which is a personal right. If they are legally allowed to consent, then they might not be in the wrong. Also, the mom didn't provide a clear reason for waiting, just an arbitrary age. The author's reasoning about convenience and future work seems practical.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author should have respected their mom's wishes despite being able to make the decision themselves. If the mom is a legal guardian, she might have some authority, but if the author is emancipated or can consent independently, that changes things. Since the author is 17, the answer might depend on local laws. But since the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally, maybe the answer is more about the relationship dynamics.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as taking control of their own health, which is positive, but not involving the mom might have been considerate. However, the mom's anger and the author's need for a long-term solution are both valid points. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author might not be entirely wrong since they're making a personal health decision. The mom's overreaction is a red flag, and the author's reasoning about convenience and work is valid. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
