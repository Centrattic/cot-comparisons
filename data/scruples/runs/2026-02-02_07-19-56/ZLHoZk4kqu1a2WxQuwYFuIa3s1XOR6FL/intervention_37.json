I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting the birth control implant without telling her mom. The situation is that the author is 17, wanted to switch from the Depo shot to Nexplanon, discussed it with her mom who said to wait until 18, but the author went ahead and got it done without her mom's consent. Now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, minors can make their own medical decisions regarding reproductive health. For example, in the US, minors can consent to certain medical services without parental consent, especially for reproductive health under laws like the Title X program. So legally, the author might have the right to make this decision.\n\nBut then there's the family dynamic. The mom agreed to the Depo shot, but when the daughter asked about Nexplanon, the mom wanted her to wait until 18. The daughter went ahead anyway. The mom found out later and was upset. The daughter argues that the mom is overreacting and that the mom herself uses an IUD, so she should understand. Also, the daughter isn't sexually active and just wants a long-term solution.\n\nThe key points here are: the daughter's legal right to consent to medical treatment, the mom's wishes versus the daughter's autonomy, and whether the daughter's actions were justified given her reasoning. Since the daughter is 17 and in many jurisdictions can consent to birth control, she might not be in the wrong legally. However, ethically, there's a consideration of respecting the parent's wishes if they believe in being consulted. But since the daughter has her own reasons and the mom isn't providing a good reason to wait (other than age), maybe the daughter is right to make her own choice.\n\nBut some might argue that the daughter should have discussed it more or considered the parent's perspective. However, if the parent is being dismissive and not engaging in a conversation, the daughter might feel she has no other choice. Also, the daughter's future plans (working full-time after 18) make getting the implant now more convenient.\n\nSo considering all factors, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B). But I need to check if there's any legal aspect that might make her in the wrong. If in her specific location, parental consent is required for such procedures, then she might be wrong. But the question doesn't specify the location, and assuming it's a place where minors can consent to birth control, then she's not in the wrong.\n"
