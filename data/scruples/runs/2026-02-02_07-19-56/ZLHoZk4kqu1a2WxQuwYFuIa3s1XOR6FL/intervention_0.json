I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant without telling her mom. The mom had asked her to wait until she's 18. The author thinks the mom is overreacting, especially since the mom uses an IUD herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. But laws vary, so the mom might have expected to be involved because of her role in decision-making before. However, if the author could legally get the implant without parental consent, that's a point in her favor.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The mom might feel disrespected or worried. The author didn't give her a chance to discuss the reasons, which could have led to understanding. The mom's reaction (hanging up, later being upset) shows she felt hurt. The author's argument about convenience and future work plans is valid, but maybe the mom wanted to be more involved in the decision.\n\nThe fact that the author isn't sexually active might make the mom question the urgency. But the author has the right to make choices about her body. The mom's insistence on waiting 3 months without explaining her reasons could be seen as controlling. However, cutting off communication might be seen as harsh.\n\nIn AITA situations, the key is balancing rights and respect. The author acted within her legal rights if allowed, but may have hurt her mom's feelings by not discussing it more. The mom's overreaction is possible, but the author could have handled it better by explaining her reasons more thoroughly. So, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but the approach could have been different. However, the mom's reaction is also a factor. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm not sure. Need to check if the author had the right to make the decision without consent. If yes, then maybe B. If not, A. But the situation says the clinic did it without the mom being there. So if the clinic allowed it, then the author was within her rights. Therefore, not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
