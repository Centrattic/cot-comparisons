I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. \n\nI brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I\u2019m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. \n\nI went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn\u2019t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I\u2019m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).\n\nShe said she wanted to do \u2018research on it\u2019 and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I\u2019m not too sure why she\u2019s going so hard about it. What would\u2019ve been the difference between now and 18? I\u2019m not sure why she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for switching her birth control without telling her mom. The author is 17 and got the Nexplanon implant without her mom's consent, even though her mom had told her to wait until she's 18. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent for medical procedures. In many places, minors can consent to certain medical treatments, especially related to reproductive health. So maybe the author had the legal right to make that decision on her own.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of parental authority. The mom might feel that since she's a parent, she has a say in her daughter's medical decisions. However, the daughter is 17, so she's almost an adult. The mom also uses an IUD herself, so maybe she's being inconsistent here. The daughter explained her reasons for getting the implant earlier, like not working full-time yet, which makes sense. \n\nThe daughter isn't sexually active, so maybe the mom's concern is more about the procedure itself rather than pregnancy prevention. But the daughter has her own reasons for choosing long-term birth control. The mom's reaction seems to be based on not discussing it first and maybe not trusting her daughter's judgment. \n\nI need to weigh the daughter's autonomy against her mother's authority. Since the daughter is close to 18 and the medical decision is legal for her to make, maybe she's not in the wrong. The mom might be overreacting, especially since she agreed to wait but then didn't follow up. The daughter had her own reasoning and took responsibility for her choice. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she made a legal, informed decision for her own health, even without her mom's initial approval.\n"
