Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is complex. She's had multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, and recent heart issues. Her husband is pressuring her for sex despite her discomfort and pain. She's also managing a lot of responsibilities like housework and kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her physical and emotional state. Having a colostomy bag is a major life change and can affect one's self-esteem and comfort level. The surgeries and recovery are likely causing her physical pain. Then there's the heart issue adding to the stress. These factors make it difficult for her to engage in sexual activity, which is a valid reason.\n\nHer husband's behavior is also a factor. He's being pushy and grabs her breasts, which could be a form of non-consensual touch and pressure. Even if he's saying he's okay with the colostomy bag, his actions suggest he's not respecting her boundaries and feelings. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding, especially during times of health challenges.\n\nThe author is trying to maintain intimacy through oral sex, which her husband has preferred for years. She's making an effort, but it's not meeting his expectations. She's also taking steps to show she cares with breakfast and other gestures. However, the core issue is consent and her ability to feel comfortable.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should prioritize each other's well-being. If one partner is physically and emotionally unable to engage in an activity, the other should respect that. The husband's frustration leading to him going out to get drunk might indicate his own coping mechanisms, but it doesn't justify pressuring her when she's clearly struggling.\n\nThe author isn't refusing sex out of spite but due to genuine reasons. It's important to recognize that physical intimacy requires willingness and comfort. The husband's pushiness without considering her circumstances could be the real issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not having sex under these circumstances. She's in a difficult situation and is trying to navigate it as best as she can.\n"
