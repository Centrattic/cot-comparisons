Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after surgery. The author has a colostomy bag and heart issues, which are making sex painful and stressful. She's tried to have sex but it's not working, and her husband is pushy. She's offering oral instead and a nice breakfast to show care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author is dealing with significant health issues that are affecting her ability to engage in sexual activity. Pain and emotional stress are valid reasons for not wanting sex. The husband, while being supportive in some ways, is pressuring her, which isn't healthy. It's important that both partners communicate their needs. The author is making an effort by offering oral and breakfast, which shows she's trying to meet his needs without full intercourse. \n\nI don't think it's the author's fault. She's in a difficult situation with medical reasons. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk seems irrational and harmful. The author's decision to prioritize her well-being while still showing affection through other means is reasonable. Relationships require mutual understanding, and the husband should be empathetic towards her struggles. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
