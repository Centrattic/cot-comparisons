Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is complex with multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the author has a colostomy bag from surgery and is dealing with heart issues. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing for her. She's been open to oral, which her husband prefers. Recently, the husband is pressuring her for sex, even being pushy and grabbing her breasts. He got angry when she refused and went out to get drunk. The author is trying to manage her energy between housework and caring for two kids, leaving her exhausted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thought she was, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and health. The author is not refusing for selfish reasons but due to physical and emotional challenges. The husband's behavior of pressuring and being pushy might be part of the problem. It's important to consider that she's under significant medical stress, which affects her ability to engage in intimacy. Also, she's making efforts to show care through oral and breakfast, indicating she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going to drink is concerning and could indicate his own issues with handling rejection or stress.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and find a balance. The author isn't refusing without reason; her health and well-being are valid factors. The husband's approach seems to lack sensitivity to her current situation. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's navigating a difficult period and is making efforts to maintain the relationship despite her challenges. The husband's behavior might be more at fault here for not respecting her boundaries and current limitations.\n"
