Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's been through a lot of surgeries, including a colostomy bag, which she finds embarrassing and painful during sex. She's also dealing with heart issues and stress. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, but she's not interested and instead offers oral sex, which he's preferred before. She's tried to be considerate by making breakfast and considering more, but she's really struggling emotionally and physically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her circumstances. The colostomy bag is causing her physical pain and emotional distress. She's had multiple surgeries and now heart problems. These are valid reasons for her lack of desire. Her husband's insistence might be coming from a place of needing intimacy, but he's not respecting her boundaries when she says she's not up for it. The fact that he becomes angry and goes to get drunk suggests his behavior is problematic. She's making efforts to show love in other ways, like oral sex and breakfast, which he's already accepted. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. She's clearly communicated her discomfort and the reasons behind it. It's the husband who's being pushy and not considering her current state. The fact that he's been okay with oral sex in the past shows that there are other ways they can maintain intimacy without penetrative sex. She's not avoiding all forms of connection but is focusing on what she's comfortable with given her health issues. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's managing her health and trying to support her husband in her own way. The husband needs to be more understanding and not pressure her into something she's not ready for. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
