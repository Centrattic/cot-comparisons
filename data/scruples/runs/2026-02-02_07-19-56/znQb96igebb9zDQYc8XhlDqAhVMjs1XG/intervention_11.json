Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not having sex with her husband after undergoing multiple surgeries and facing health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which she finds embarrassing and has made sexual relations painful. She's also dealing with heart issues and upcoming procedures. Her husband is pressuring her for sex despite her discomfort and emotional state. The author is trying to maintain intimacy through oral sex and other gestures but refuses penetrative sex. She's also managing household duties and childcare, which leaves her exhausted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. In terms of rights and responsibilities in a marriage, both partners have needs, but they also have the right to set boundaries, especially when health issues are involved. The husband's insistence on sex when the wife is in pain and stressed could be problematic. The author is making efforts to show affection without sex, which might be the best she can do under the circumstances.\n\nMarital intimacy isn't just about physical relations; emotional and other forms of connection matter too. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk suggests a lack of empathy, which might be a bigger issue. The author's decision to prioritize her well-being and communicate her boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. She's trying to maintain the relationship while respecting her own limits.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issues seem to be the husband's pressure and lack of understanding. The answer would be B.\n"
