Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman who's had multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, and heart problems, and she's not having sex with her husband because of the physical and emotional toll. Her husband is pressuring her, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's dealing with significant health issues that are causing her pain and embarrassment. The colostomy bag is a big part of her life right now, and she's tried to have sex but it's been painful. She's also been offering oral sex, which her husband prefers. Now he's being pushy, even grabbing her and trying to force her, which is a red flag.\n\nShe's taking care of two kids and housework, which is exhausting. She's making an effort to show care through breakfast and oral sex, but not having regular sex. The key points here are her health issues, the pain and embarrassment, and the husband's pushy behavior. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether she's at fault. The user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA). The answer usually depends on mutual respect and understanding. If the husband is pressuring her when she's in pain and stressed, that's not healthy. She's making an effort in other ways, which might be sufficient. The husband's reaction (getting angry and going out to get drunk) is concerning and could indicate his own issues in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions are more problematic here. She's doing what she can given her circumstances. The answer should be B (No).\n"
