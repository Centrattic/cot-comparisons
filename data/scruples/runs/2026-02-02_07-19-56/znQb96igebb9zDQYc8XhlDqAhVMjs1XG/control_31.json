Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves her undergoing multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, heart issues, and her husband's pushy behavior.\n\nFirst, the woman has significant medical challenges: emergency surgery leading to a colostomy, which is still present despite more surgeries. She's facing a possible delay in reversal surgery and a heart issue requiring an angiogram. These are serious health issues that can affect her physical and emotional state. Her husband is being supportive with household and childcare, but she's struggling with the emotional and physical aspects.\n\nShe mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing due to the colostomy bag. She's willing to give oral sex, which her husband prefers. However, he's been pushy lately, trying to force physical contact. She feels pressured and is emotionally overwhelmed. Her husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk adds tension.\n\nThe key points here are her health conditions affecting her ability and willingness, her husband's pushiness, and her efforts to maintain intimacy through other means (oral sex, breakfast). She's feeling guilty but is in a state where her energy is drained from managing everything else.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, mutual respect and communication are crucial. Her husband's insistence without considering her medical and emotional state could be seen as dismissive. She's making an effort to show care through other actions, which might be sufficient for maintaining emotional connection. The husband's push for physical intimacy despite her clear discomfort and health issues might be the bigger issue here.\n\nThe author's decision to not have sex isn't due to a lack of care but because of valid medical reasons and emotional stress. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
