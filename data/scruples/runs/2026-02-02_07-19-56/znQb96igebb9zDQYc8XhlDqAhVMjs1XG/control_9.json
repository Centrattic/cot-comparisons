Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The author has been through a lot: emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, multiple surgeries, and now heart issues. She's facing physical pain and emotional stress, which is making sex difficult and unpleasant for her. She's tried to have sex but it's been painful, and she's opted for oral sex instead. Her husband has been pressuring her to have sex, even forceful in his approach, and she's feeling guilty for not complying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has legitimate medical reasons contributing to her inability to engage in sexual activity. The colostomy bag is a significant physical and emotional barrier. She's also dealing with heart problems, which add to her stress. Her husband's insistence, especially when she's already feeling overwhelmed, seems to be part of the problem. The fact that he grabs her and tries to push for sex is a red flag for potential non-consensual behavior, which is definitely not okay.\n\nThe author is making an effort by offering oral sex and planning to make breakfast to show care. She's trying to meet her husband's needs in other ways while her body and emotional state limit her ability to have sex. She's also handling a lot of responsibilities at home and caring for two kids, which drains her energy. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The husband's pressure and forceful actions are problematic. The author isn't refusing sex out of spite or indifference; it's due to genuine physical and emotional challenges. She's making efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and work through challenges together. The husband's pushiness, especially when she's clearly not comfortable, is the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and setting boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
