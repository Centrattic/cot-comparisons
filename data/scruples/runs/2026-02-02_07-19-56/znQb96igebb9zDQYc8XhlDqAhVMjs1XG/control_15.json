Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a colostomy bag from surgery, recent heart issues, and the husband's pushiness. \n\nFirst, the author has been through a lot: emergency surgery, multiple procedures, a colostomy bag, and now heart problems. The physical and emotional toll must be huge. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing because of the bag, which is a valid concern. She's willing to do oral, which the husband prefers, but lately he's been pressuring her for sex.\n\nThe husband is trying to be helpful with housework and childcare, but she's overwhelmed with taking care of two kids and housework, leaving her no energy. The husband's recent behavior\u2014grabbing her breasts and pushing for sex when she's not able\u2014sounds like it's crossing a boundary. That could be emotional or even physical pressure, which isn't healthy.\n\nShe's trying to maintain the relationship by offering oral and breakfast, but she's clear she doesn't want sex. The question is whether she's at fault. From what's described, she's dealing with medical issues that make sex painful and stressful. She's making an effort in other ways, but the husband's pushiness might be part of the problem. \n\nIntimacy isn't just physical; emotional support is important too. But she's in a bad place physically and emotionally. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk isn't helpful either. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's managing her health, caring for the family, and dealing with a spouse who's not respecting her boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
