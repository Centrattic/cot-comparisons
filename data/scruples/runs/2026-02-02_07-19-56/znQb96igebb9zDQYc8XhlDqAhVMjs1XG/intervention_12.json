Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which she finds embarrassing and painful during sex. She's been dealing with this for a year, and now there's a reversal surgery planned, but her heart issues might complicate that. Her husband, on the other hand, is pushing for sex, even when she's not up for it. He's been physically pressuring her, grabbing her breasts and trying to coerce her. The author is offering oral sex, which he's preferred for 15 years, and she's trying to show affection with breakfast and other gestures. However, she's exhausted from housework and childcare, and the thought of sex is causing her emotional distress.\n\nSo, the key points here are her physical and emotional state, the husband's pressure, and the lack of communication. The husband's behavior of pressuring her and getting upset when she refuses might be problematic. The author isn't refusing all intimacy but is offering oral sex. She's also under significant medical stress, which affects her libido. The question is whether her refusal to have sex is wrong.\n\nConsidering consent and mutual respect in a marriage, it's important that both partners feel comfortable. The husband's pushy behavior could be a red flag. The author's reasons are valid\u2014health issues, pain, and stress. She's making efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. It's possible the husband isn't respecting her boundaries. In such cases, open communication is crucial, but the author isn't entirely at fault for prioritizing her well-being. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
