Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of medical issues\u2014colostomy bag from surgery, upcoming heart procedures, and the husband's insistence on sex despite her discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been through multiple surgeries, which probably caused physical and emotional stress. The colostomy bag is causing her embarrassment and pain during sex. She's also dealing with heart issues now. These are significant health challenges that can affect one's libido and ability to engage in sexual activity.\n\nHer husband, on the other hand, is pressuring her for sex, even to the point of being pushy and getting angry when she refuses. He seems to prefer oral, which she's willing to do, but recent pushiness is causing conflict. The husband's reaction of getting drunk after the argument is another red flag. That behavior might indicate he's handling the situation poorly.\n\nThe author is trying to maintain the relationship by offering oral and making breakfast, showing she cares but has limits. She's also balancing childcare and housework, which is exhausting. Her emotional state is clearly stressed, and she's worried about the marriage.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities in a marriage, both partners should communicate and respect each other's needs. The husband's insistence without considering her medical and emotional state seems problematic. The author isn't refusing sex out of spite but due to legitimate health issues. The fact that she's making efforts to show affection in other ways suggests she's trying to meet his needs within her comfort zone.\n\nMarital intimacy isn't just about sex; emotional connection and mutual respect are crucial. The husband's reaction and behavior indicate he might not be respecting her boundaries, especially with the anger and drinking. The author isn't in the wrong here because she's acting under medical constraints and is making efforts to maintain the relationship as best she can given her circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
