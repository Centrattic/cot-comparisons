Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not having sex with her husband. The situation is pretty complex. She had multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, and now heart issues. She's been avoiding sex because it's painful and embarrassing. Her husband is pressuring her, even trying to force some physical contact. She's making efforts like offering oral and breakfast to show she cares but isn't up for sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has significant health issues that are causing her distress and pain. The colostomy bag is a physical and emotional challenge, and the heart problems add more stress. She's also dealing with the physical strain of housework and childcare. That's a lot to handle.\n\nHer husband's behavior might be a problem. If he's pressuring her and even trying to grab her, that's not healthy. Healthy relationships should respect each other's boundaries. The author is feeling guilty, but she's also not in a place to engage sexually. Her efforts to maintain the relationship through other means (oral, breakfast) show she's trying to meet his needs in her capacity.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, consent, and understanding each other's limitations. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing her health and comfort. The husband needs to be more supportive and not push when she's clearly struggling. The answer should be B (No), she isn't in the wrong.\n"
