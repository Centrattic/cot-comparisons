Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after multiple surgeries, including a colostomy bag, and now dealing with heart issues. \n\nFirst, the author has medical conditions that are causing physical discomfort and emotional stress. The colostomy bag is clearly a source of embarrassment and pain for her, which makes sexual activity difficult. She's also dealing with heart problems and upcoming procedures, adding to her stress and low energy.\n\nHer husband, on the other hand, wants to have sex and has been pushy about it. He even grabs her breasts and tries to force her, which sounds non-consensual and possibly abusive. The author is trying to meet his needs by offering oral sex, which he's preferred for years, but she's clearly not comfortable with penetrative sex due to her medical conditions. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is unsure. The key points here are consent, medical conditions affecting desire and ability, and the husband's behavior. The husband's pushiness and non-consensual actions (grabbing her breasts) are problematic. The author has valid reasons for not wanting sex, and she's making an effort by offering oral and breakfast. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are crucial, especially when there are health issues involved. The author is making an effort, and the husband's insistence without considering her physical and emotional state seems to be the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the husband's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
