Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe woman had emergency surgery a year ago and now has a colostomy bag. She's been through multiple surgeries and is about to have a reversal, but there's a complication with her heart. She's been trying to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy. She's offered oral sex, which her husband prefers. Recently, he's been pressuring her for sex, even grabbing her and trying to force it. She's been refusing due to pain, emotional stress, and low energy from managing the house and kids. She's planning to make breakfast and offer oral again to show she cares but doesn't want sex.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's at fault. Let me break this down. First, she has legitimate medical issues affecting her ability to have sex. The colostomy bag is causing her physical discomfort and emotional distress. Her husband's behavior of being pushy and grabbing her is concerning. That sounds like non-consensual behavior or at least inappropriate pressure. She's made efforts to maintain intimacy through oral sex, which he's preferred. However, she's overwhelmed with her health, the kids, and housework, leading to exhaustion. She's also dealing with a potential delay in surgery and heart issues, which add to her stress.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. She's tried to meet his needs by offering alternatives. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk is not helpful. His pressure could be contributing to the problem. The author's reasons for not having sex are valid and rooted in her physical and emotional state. It's important to consider consent and mutual respect here. If she's not comfortable, she's not in the wrong. The husband should respect her boundaries, especially given her circumstances.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, marriage doesn't mean you have to have sex when you're not physically or emotionally able. The fact that he's pressuring her despite her clear discomfort and medical issues is problematic. The answer probably leans towards B (she's not in the wrong) because of her legitimate health reasons and the husband's inappropriate behavior. However, I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The user might think that a spouse is entitled to sex, but consent and health are paramount. So, yes, she's not at fault here.\n"
