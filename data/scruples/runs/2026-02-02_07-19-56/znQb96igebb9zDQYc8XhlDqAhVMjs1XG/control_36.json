Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after undergoing surgeries and dealing with health issues. Let me break down the key points from the story.\n\nThe author has a colostomy bag from emergency surgery and has had multiple procedures. Her husband has been helping with household and childcare, but she's struggling. She's also facing heart issues needing an angiogram, which might affect her surgery plans. She's tried to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing due to the colostomy bag. The husband prefers oral sex, which she's been willing to do. Recently, he's been pushy, even grabbing her and trying to force sex when she's not up for it. She feels pressured, has low energy from managing the house and kids, and is trying to show she cares through other means like breakfast and oral. She's worried about their marriage.\n\nNow, considering all that, the main issue here is consent and mutual respect in the relationship. The husband's pushiness and physical pressure could be signs of disrespecting her boundaries, especially when she's clearly not comfortable and is in physical and emotional distress. She's making an effort to maintain intimacy through other acts, which shows she cares. The fact that he's getting angry and going out to drink might indicate his own issues with handling rejection or stress. The author's situation involves significant health challenges that affect her ability and desire for sex. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate openly and respect each other's needs and comfort levels. The husband needs to understand her medical and emotional state, while she's trying to find other ways to express affection. The pushiness from the husband seems to be the key problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and not being able to meet his sexual demands under these circumstances. There's no indication she's refusing all forms of intimacy, just the act of sex, which she finds painful and distressing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
