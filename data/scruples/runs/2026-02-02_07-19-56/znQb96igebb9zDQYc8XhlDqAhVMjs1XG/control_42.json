Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a colostomy bag from surgery, ongoing health issues, and the husband's pushiness.\n\nFirst, the author has been through a lot: emergency surgery, multiple procedures, a colostomy bag that's causing her embarrassment and pain, and recent heart problems. She's also managing household and childcare. The husband has been helping but is now pressuring for sex, even when she's not comfortable. She's tried to communicate her issues, like the pain and emotional stress, but he's not respecting her feelings. He even got angry and went out to get drunk.\n\nThe key points here are consent, health issues, and communication. The author is not in the wrong because she has valid physical and emotional reasons for not wanting to have sex. The husband's insistence without considering her feelings is problematic. She's making efforts to show affection through oral and breakfast, which shows she cares but has boundaries. The husband's reaction (getting angry and drunk) is a red flag. The author's health conditions are significant, and she's under a lot of stress. It's not her fault she can't have sex right now. The question is about being in the wrong, and given the circumstances, she's not at fault. The right answer should be B.\n"
