Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, and she's had multiple surgeries. She mentions it's still there, and she's about to have reversal surgery, but there's a complication with her heart needing an angiogram. So she's dealing with a lot of health issues.\n\nShe's tried having sex but it's been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. She's offered oral sex, which her husband has preferred for 15 years. Recently, he's been pushy, grabbing her breasts and trying to get her to have sex. She's been dealing with physical pain, emotional stress from her health issues, and exhaustion from taking care of two kids and housework.\n\nShe feels bad about not having sex and wants to maintain intimacy, so she's planning to make breakfast and offer oral again. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from what I can see, the author is going through a lot. Her physical and emotional state is affecting her ability to engage in sexual activity. The husband's behavior seems to be pressuring her, which might not be healthy. The author is trying to meet his needs in other ways, like oral sex and showing care through breakfast. She's also taking on a lot of household and parenting responsibilities, leaving her with low energy. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. The husband's insistence might be disregarding her feelings and physical state. The author isn't refusing out of spite but due to valid health and emotional reasons. She's also making efforts to maintain intimacy in ways that work for her. \n\nSo, I think the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. The situation is challenging for both, but her reasons are legitimate and she's making an effort to support her husband in other ways. The husband's pushiness and the physical/emotional issues she's facing make her position understandable."
