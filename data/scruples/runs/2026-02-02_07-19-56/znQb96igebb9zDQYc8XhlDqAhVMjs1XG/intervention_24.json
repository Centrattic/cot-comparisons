Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author had emergency surgery a year ago, which led to a colostomy bag. She's been through multiple surgeries and is dealing with the emotional and physical stress. She's about to have reversal surgery but got bad news about her heart needing an angiogram. Her husband has been trying to get her to have sex, but she finds it painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. She's been willing to give oral sex, which he prefers. Recently, he's been pushy, grabbing her breasts and getting angry when she refuses. She feels bad about not being intimate but is overwhelmed with her health issues, housework, and kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are her health challenges, the physical discomfort from the colostomy, the pressure from her husband, and her efforts to maintain the relationship in other ways like oral sex and breakfast. The question is whether she's at fault for refusing sex.\n\nI think the main factors are her health issues causing her to avoid sex and her husband's pushy behavior. The author is clearly under a lot of stress, both physically and emotionally. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk isn't healthy either. The fact that she's making efforts to show care through other means (oral sex, breakfast) suggests she's trying to meet his needs in the ways she can. \n\nThe husband's pushiness and physical grabbing might be a form of emotional or physical pressure that's crossing a line. The author's inability to engage in penetrative sex due to pain and embarrassment is a legitimate reason. Also, considering her health issues and the responsibilities she has, it's understandable she's exhausted and can't meet his needs in that way. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, I don't think so. Relationships require mutual understanding and adjustment, especially during health crises. The husband might need to be more empathetic and work on other ways to connect. The author is making an effort but has limits. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
