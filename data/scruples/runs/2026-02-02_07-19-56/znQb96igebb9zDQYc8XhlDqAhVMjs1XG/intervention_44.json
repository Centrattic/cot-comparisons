Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not having sex with their husband after surgery and health issues. They have a colostomy bag from emergency surgery a year ago, and it's still there. They had to have two more surgeries and now there's a heart issue with an angiogram coming up. The reversal surgery for the colostomy might not happen as planned.\n\nThey mention that they've tried to have sex, but it's been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. The husband says the bag doesn't bother him, but it does bother the author a lot. She's been willing to give him oral, which he has almost preferred over regular sex for 15 years. Now, the husband is being pushy, grabbing her breasts and trying to get her to have sex. She's not feeling up to it due to the bag, pain, heart issues, and stress. She's low on energy from taking care of the house and two kids, and she's planning to offer oral and make a nice breakfast to show she cares.\n\nThe key points here are the medical conditions affecting her ability to engage in sex, the husband's pushiness and lack of sensitivity, and her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. The author is in a tough spot with significant health challenges and physical limitations. The husband's insistence on sex despite her clear discomfort and the current medical issues might not be appropriate. However, the author is making an effort with oral and breakfast, which could be seen as a way to support her husband's needs.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not having sex. From what's described, she's dealing with physical and emotional stressors, and the husband's actions (pushing for sex, getting angry about going out to get drunk) might be contributing to the problem. The author isn't refusing all forms of intimacy; she's offering an alternative. So, considering the context, it seems the responsibility might be more on the husband's side for not respecting her boundaries and current health issues. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
