Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after undergoing multiple surgeries and dealing with health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a colostomy bag due to emergency surgery a year ago, and it's still present. She's been willing to have oral sex, which her husband prefers. But she's been avoiding sex because of pain, embarrassment from the colostomy, and recent heart problems leading to an angiogram. Her husband is pressuring her, even being pushy and grabbing her, then getting angry and going out to get drunk. She's feeling bad about not meeting his needs and is trying to compensate with breakfast and oral sex, but she's emotionally and physically drained from taking care of two kids and household tasks.\n\nThe key points here are her health issues causing physical and emotional distress, her willingness to meet her husband's needs in other ways, and his pushy behavior. The question is about whether she's at fault. \n\nIn relationships, consent and mutual respect are crucial. If she's experiencing pain and has valid medical reasons, it's her right to refuse sex. The husband's actions of grabbing her and pressuring her might be a form of non-consensual contact, which is not okay. The fact that she's making an effort with oral and breakfast shows she's trying to maintain intimacy without having full intercourse. \n\nAlso, the stress from her health and caregiving responsibilities would naturally impact her libido and ability to engage in sexual activity. The husband should be supportive during her recovery, especially with the added heart concerns. His reaction of getting angry and going out to drink seems dismissive of her feelings and medical situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making the best decisions for her health and well-being while still showing care through other means. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
