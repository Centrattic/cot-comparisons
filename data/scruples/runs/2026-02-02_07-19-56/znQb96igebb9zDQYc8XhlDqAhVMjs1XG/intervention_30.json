Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves medical issues like a colostomy bag and heart problems, which are affecting her ability to engage in sexual activity. The husband is pushy and wants sex, while she's struggling with pain, embarrassment, and the stress of her health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author has a medical condition that makes sex painful and emotionally difficult. She's also dealing with significant health stressors, including an upcoming angiogram. She's tried to be accommodating by offering oral sex, which her husband has preferred for years. However, lately, he's been pressuring her for sex, leading to conflict. She's making efforts to show care through breakfast and other gestures but isn't comfortable with penetrative sex.\n\nFrom a legal or ethical standpoint, consent and health are crucial. The woman isn't refusing out of spite but due to medical reasons. Her husband's insistence despite her discomfort could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. The author is trying to maintain the relationship but within her physical and emotional limits. It's important to note that intimacy isn't solely about sex; it can include other forms of connection.\n\nCommon advice in such situations emphasizes communication, empathy, and understanding each other's needs. The husband's frustration is valid, but pressuring her isn't the solution. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and setting boundaries. She's making efforts to meet his needs through oral sex and other gestures, which shows she's trying to keep the relationship healthy without compromising her well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. Her husband needs to understand her limitations and work with her to find a solution that respects both their needs.\n"
