Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether she's at fault for not having sex with her husband. Let's break down the details she provided.\n\nFirst, she had emergency surgery a year ago and now has a colostomy bag. She's had three surgeries, and the bag is still there. She's also facing heart issues with an angiogram and possible surgery. So she's dealing with a lot of physical and emotional stress right now. Her husband has been helpful with housework and childcare, but he's been pushy about having sex lately. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag. She's offered oral sex, which he's preferred for 15 years, but she's really not up for sex now.\n\nShe tried to have sex but it's been difficult. Her husband pushes her, even when she's not interested, leading to conflict. He even got angry and went out to get drunk. She's trying to show she cares by offering oral and making breakfast, but she doesn't want sex. She's worried about her marriage and feels bad about not meeting his needs.\n\nSo, the main points are: her physical health issues are making sex painful and uncomfortable, she's under a lot of stress, and she's making efforts in other ways. The husband is pushing for sex despite her discomfort.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault here. She's dealing with medical conditions that affect her ability to engage in sexual activity, which is a valid reason for not wanting sex. The husband's insistence and lack of sensitivity to her physical and emotional state might be the bigger issue. The fact that he got angry and resorted to getting drunk shows poor handling of the situation. The author is trying to maintain intimacy through other means, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nAlso, the husband's preference for oral sex has been longstanding, so it's not like the author is suddenly refusing everything. She's willing to accommodate his preferences in that way. The key issue seems to be the pressure and lack of understanding from the husband regarding her current limitations due to health issues.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her situation is complex, and she's making efforts to support her husband's needs within her comfort and health constraints. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. So the answer should be B.\n"
