Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after her surgeries and health issues.\n\nFirst, the wife had emergency surgery a year ago, resulting in a colostomy bag. She's had three surgeries and is now facing heart issues. The reversal surgery for the colostomy is in question because of the heart blockages. She's been trying to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing for her. The husband says the colostomy bag doesn't bother him, but it does for her. She's offered oral sex, which he's preferred for 15 years. Recently, he's been pushy, grabbing her and trying to get her to have sex. She's been too stressed, in pain, and exhausted from housework and caring for two kids. Now she's feeling bad about it and wants to make breakfast and offer oral again to show she cares, but she doesn't want sex.\n\nSo, considering all this, she's dealing with significant physical and emotional challenges. The husband's pushiness seems out of place given her health and stress. She's making an effort with oral and breakfast, which shows she's trying to maintain intimacy. The key points are her health issues affecting her ability to engage in sex, her husband's pushiness despite her clear discomfort, and her efforts to show love in other ways. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife isn't in the wrong because she's under a lot of stress and has valid reasons for not engaging in sexual relations. The husband needs to be more understanding of her situation. The fact that he's pressuring her, even to the point of getting angry and going out to get drunk, is problematic. The wife's actions are reasonable given her circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
