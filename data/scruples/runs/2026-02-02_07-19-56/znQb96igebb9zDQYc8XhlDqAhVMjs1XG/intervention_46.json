Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author is a woman who's been through a lot of health issues, including a colostomy bag from surgery and recent heart problems. Her husband has been pressuring her for sex, which she's been avoiding because of the physical and emotional challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her circumstances. She's been through multiple surgeries, dealing with a colostomy bag, which is probably causing her a lot of self-consciousness and physical discomfort. She mentions that having sex has been painful and embarrassing for her. Also, she has to undergo an angiogram soon because of heart issues, adding more stress. On top of that, she's managing household duties and caring for two kids, which leaves her with very little energy. \n\nThe husband is insisting on sex, even grabbing her and trying to force it, getting angry when she resists. He prefers oral over regular sex, which she's been willing to do. But she's not willing to have intercourse anymore. She's trying to maintain the relationship by offering oral and making breakfast, but she's clearly struggling with the emotional and physical aspects.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not having sex. From a rights perspective, no one should be forced into any sexual activity they're uncomfortable with. The husband's actions of grabbing her and pressuring her could be a form of coercion or even abuse. The author has valid reasons rooted in her health and emotional state. \n\nHowever, she does feel guilty and wants to maintain the relationship, so she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. She's not refusing all intimacy\u2014she's offering oral sex, which the husband prefers. That shows she's making an effort, but her limits are clear. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The husband's pushiness and lack of consideration for her health issues might be problematic. The author isn't at fault because she's prioritizing her well-being and communicating her boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
