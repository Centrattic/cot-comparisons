Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of health issues\u2014colostomy bag from surgery, upcoming heart procedures, and the emotional and physical stress that comes with that. The husband is pressuring her for sex, which she finds painful and embarrassing due to the colostomy. She's offering oral instead, which he's preferred for years, but she's at her limit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a legitimate medical condition causing physical discomfort and emotional distress. The husband is pressuring her, even getting angry when she refuses. She's already making efforts to maintain intimacy through other means. The question is whether she's wrong for not engaging in penetrative sex when she's not physically or emotionally able to.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. If one partner is unable or unwilling due to valid reasons like health issues, the other should be supportive. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk seems inappropriate. The author is trying to show care through other gestures, which is commendable. The fact that she's taking on a lot of household and childcare responsibilities also adds to her stress.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with significant challenges and is making efforts within her capacity. The husband should be more empathetic and not pressure her. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
