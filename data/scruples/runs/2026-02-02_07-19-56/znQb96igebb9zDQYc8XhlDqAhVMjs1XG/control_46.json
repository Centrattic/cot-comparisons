Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman had emergency surgery a year ago leading to a colostomy bag, which has been causing her pain and embarrassment. She's had three surgeries and is facing heart issues now. Her husband has been somewhat helpful but recently is pushing for sex. She's been willing to give oral, which he prefers, but now he's pressuring her for intercourse. She's exhausted from housework, childcare, and dealing with her health issues. She tried to offer oral and make breakfast, but doesn't want sex.\n\nThe key points here are her medical conditions causing physical and emotional distress, her husband's pressure, and her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. The question is whether she's at fault. \n\nMarital intimacy is important, but it's also about mutual respect and understanding. If she's in pain, stressed, and dealing with health issues, forcing sex could be harmful. Her husband's response of getting angry and going out to get drunk seems problematic. The fact that she's making efforts (oral, breakfast) shows she's trying to meet his needs in her capacity. \n\nAlso, the husband's insistence despite her clear discomfort might indicate a lack of empathy on his part. The author's reasons are valid and health-related. It's not just about not wanting sex, but being physically and emotionally unable. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). She's doing her best under difficult circumstances, and her husband needs to be more understanding. The fault isn't on her for prioritizing her well-being and health.\n"
