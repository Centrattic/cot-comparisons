Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with their husband. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been through a lot. They had emergency surgery with a colostomy bag, which is still present after multiple surgeries. They mention it's painful and embarrassing, which makes sex difficult. Their husband has been somewhat supportive, but the author is dealing with physical and emotional stress from heart issues, upcoming procedures, and the reversal surgery. \n\nThe husband is pushy about sex, grabbing her and trying to force it, even when she's not interested. The author is willing to give oral, which the husband prefers, but that's not the same as regular sex. The husband's reaction when she refuses is to get angry and go out to get drunk. \n\nThe author is trying to manage a lot: housework, two kids, her health issues. She's making an effort to show care through breakfast and oral, but she just can't bring herself to have sex. She feels bad about it but is worried about the marriage.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From what I read, the husband's behavior seems to be more problematic. He's pressuring her, being physically aggressive (grabbing), and getting drunk when she says no. The author has valid reasons: medical conditions causing pain and embarrassment, emotional stress, and the physical demands of daily life. She's making compromises (oral, breakfast) but can't go further. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, mutual respect and communication are key. The husband needs to consider her feelings and health. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but due to legitimate issues. The husband's reaction is also concerning. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. The husband's pushiness and the author's valid struggles point to her not being at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
