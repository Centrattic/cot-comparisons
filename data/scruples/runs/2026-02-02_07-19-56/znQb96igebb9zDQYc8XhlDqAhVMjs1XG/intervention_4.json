Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not having sex with her husband after a series of surgeries and health issues. The husband is pressuring her for sex, but she's dealing with a colostomy bag and heart problems, which make sex painful and stressful. She's offered oral instead, but he wants more. She's trying to manage their relationship by making breakfast and offering oral, but she's struggling with the emotional and physical toll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her health. She's undergone multiple surgeries, which can affect sexual function and confidence. The colostomy bag is causing her embarrassment and pain, making intimacy difficult. Her husband's insistence might not be considering her physical limitations and emotional state. While she's making efforts, like oral sex and breakfast, it's clear she's not in the position to engage in sex without stress. \n\nMarriage advice often emphasizes mutual respect and communication. If the husband is pressuring her in a hurtful way, he might be part of the problem. The author's situation includes medical issues that aren't her fault, so expecting her to have sex when it's harmful isn't fair. However, she's making some efforts to maintain intimacy, which is positive. But the key here is that she's not at fault for prioritizing her health and well-being. The husband needs to be more understanding. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
