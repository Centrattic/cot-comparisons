Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, she had emergency surgery a year ago and now has a colostomy bag. She's been through multiple surgeries and is about to have a reversal, but there's a complication with her heart. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag. Her husband says the bag doesn't bother him, but it does bother her. She's been willing to give oral sex, which her husband prefers. Recently, the husband has been pushy about having sex, even grabbing her breasts and trying to force her. She feels stressed from the surgeries, heart issues, and taking care of two kids and housework. She tried to be proactive by offering oral and making breakfast but doesn't want sex. She's worried about her marriage and feeling bad for not fulfilling his needs.\n\nNow, considering all this, the key points are her physical and emotional state, the husband's behavior, and the dynamics of their relationship. She's dealing with significant health issues and the emotional toll that comes with them. The husband is pressuring her for sex despite her clear discomfort and the medical circumstances. She's making efforts to maintain intimacy through other means, like oral and breakfast, which shows she's trying to meet his needs in different ways.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider consent and mutual respect. If she's not comfortable and it's causing her distress, she isn't obligated to have sex. The husband's pushiness might be contributing to the tension. However, the question is about her being in the wrong. Given her circumstances, it seems she's not at fault because she's making an effort to maintain the relationship in her own way while dealing with health challenges. The husband's expectations and approach might need adjustment.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
