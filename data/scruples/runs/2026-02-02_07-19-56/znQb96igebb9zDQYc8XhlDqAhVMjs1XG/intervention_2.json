Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The woman has been through significant health challenges: emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, and now heart issues requiring an angiogram. Her husband has been helping with household and childcare, but she's struggling with energy and emotional stress. She's been avoiding sex due to the colostomy bag, which causes her pain and embarrassment. Her husband prefers oral sex and has been pressuring her for intercourse recently. Last night, he tried to push her into sex and got angry when she refused, going out to get drunk. She's trying to make amends with breakfast and oral sex but doesn't want intercourse. She's feeling guilty about her lack of interest in sex and worries about her marriage.\n\nNow, I need to assess the moral and ethical aspects. In a marriage, mutual respect and communication are key. The husband's behavior of grabbing her breasts and pressuring her for sex could be problematic. Coercion or lack of consent in any form is a red flag. The wife has valid reasons for her reluctance: physical pain, emotional stress, and health issues. She's also taking steps to show affection through other means, like oral sex and breakfast, which indicates she's trying to maintain intimacy.\n\nThe husband's insistence on sex despite her discomfort and the circumstances might be the bigger issue here. Pressuring a spouse, especially when they're not physically or emotionally able, can be considered disrespectful. The fact that he got angry and left to get drunk suggests poor coping mechanisms and potential emotional immaturity.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is in the wrong. She's not refusing sex out of spite or laziness but due to legitimate health reasons. Her actions to maintain the relationship through other gestures show effort. The husband's pressuring behavior seems to be the main problem. Therefore, the wife is not in the wrong; the issue lies more with the husband's approach and lack of sensitivity to her current situation.\n"
