Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the wife is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the wife had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is still there a year later. She's going through more surgeries and has heart issues now. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. Her husband has been trying to push for sex recently, even getting aggressive with grabbing her breasts and pushing her to have sex. She's tried oral, which the husband seems to prefer, but she's not up to it right now due to physical and emotional stress. She feels bad about not meeting his needs and is trying to show love through breakfast and oral, but she's really struggling with the idea of sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Medical issues can significantly impact a person's ability and desire for intimacy. The colostomy bag is causing her physical discomfort and emotional distress. The husband acknowledging that the bag doesn't bother him might not align with her feelings, but she's the one experiencing the pain and embarrassment. \n\nThe husband's behavior, grabbing her breasts and pressuring her for sex, could be considered non-consensual or at least disrespectful, especially if she's clearly not interested. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding, especially during times of health challenges. The wife is already dealing with a lot\u2014surgery recovery, heart issues, housework, and childcare. Her low energy and emotional state are valid factors here.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The wife is making efforts to show love through oral and breakfast, which she knows the husband prefers. However, she's not comfortable with sex, which is her right. The husband's pushiness and getting angry by threatening to get drunk might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife isn't in the wrong for not wanting to have sex when she's in pain and stressed. The husband might need to be more considerate and support her medical needs. However, the wife is trying to find a balance by offering alternatives. It's a complex situation where both partners have needs, but the wife's physical and emotional well-being is crucial here. The answer should reflect that she's not in the wrong given the circumstances.\n"
