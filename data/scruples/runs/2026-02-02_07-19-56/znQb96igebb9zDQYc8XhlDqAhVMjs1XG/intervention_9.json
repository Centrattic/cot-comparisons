Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA question is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of medical issues\u2014colostomy bag, heart problems, and surgeries. The husband is pressuring her for sex, but she's feeling physically and emotionally overwhelmed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been through multiple surgeries and is dealing with a colostomy bag, which is causing her significant distress and pain during sex. Her husband, while supportive in some ways, is pushing for physical intimacy when she's not able or willing. She's also managing a lot of stress from her health issues and family responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are her medical conditions and the emotional impact they're having on her. She's not avoiding intimacy entirely\u2014she's offering oral sex instead, which the husband has preferred for years. However, she's now struggling with the physical discomfort, emotional stress, and low energy. The husband's reaction (getting angry and going out to get drunk) adds to the tension.\n\nLegally and ethically, consent is crucial. She's clearly not comfortable, and pressuring someone for sex when they're not willing is a red flag. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and being pushy is not okay. On her side, she's making efforts to maintain intimacy through other means, which shows she cares. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a compassionate standpoint, her circumstances are challenging. She's dealing with health issues that make sex painful and emotionally difficult. The husband's insistence without considering her feelings is problematic. The author's decision to prioritize her well-being and communicate her needs isn't wrong. In fact, she's taking steps to show affection in other ways. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). Her situation is a result of medical challenges and emotional strain, which are valid reasons for her inability to engage in sex. The responsibility isn't solely on her to meet her husband's needs without regard for her own physical and mental health.\n"
