Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a colostomy bag from surgery, ongoing health issues with her heart, and the husband being pushy about sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's circumstances. She's dealing with significant physical and emotional stress. The colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment, and she's facing possible surgery complications. Her husband is pressuring her, which is making her uncomfortable. She's tried to have sex but it's painful and she's not in the mood. She's offering oral sex as an alternative, which her husband prefers, but she's clearly struggling with this too.\n\nFrom a general perspective, in a healthy relationship, mutual respect and consent are key. The husband's behavior of grabbing her breasts and pushing for sex could be seen as non-consensual or pressuring her beyond her comfort zone. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to engage in sexual activity, especially given her physical conditions and emotional state. She's making efforts to maintain intimacy through other means like breakfast and oral sex, which might not satisfy her husband, but it's her way of showing care under the circumstances.\n\nLegally and ethically, no one is obligated to have sex if they don't want to. The husband's actions might be contributing to the problem by pressuring her. The author's feelings of guilt are understandable, but she shouldn't be blamed for prioritizing her health and comfort. It's important to consider that her lack of desire is due to legitimate issues, not just disinterest in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's navigating a difficult situation with her health and trying to maintain the relationship as best she can under the circumstances. The husband's pressure is likely exacerbating the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
