Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for not having sex with their husband after major surgeries and health issues. They have a colostomy bag, which is causing them pain and embarrassment during intimacy. Their husband is pressuring them, even grabbing them and getting angry when they refuse. The author is trying to show affection through oral sex and breakfast but doesn't want penetrative sex. They're feeling guilty about their marital status.\n\nFirst, the physical and emotional toll of surgery and health problems is significant. Chronic pain and medical conditions can impact libido and willingness to engage in certain types of intimacy. The author's husband isn't respecting their boundaries by being pushy and even physically grabbing them, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and communication. The fact that the husband is getting angry and going out to get drunk suggests he's not handling the situation well.\n\nThe author is making efforts to maintain some level of intimacy through other means, like oral sex and breakfast. That shows they care about the relationship. The key issue here is the husband's behavior versus the author's legitimate reasons for not engaging in sex. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their health and comfort. They're also under stress from childcare and housework, which drains their energy. The husband needs to be more understanding and communicate better, maybe seeking couples' counseling or medical help for their sexual issues. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
