Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who hasn't had sex with her husband for about a year after emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag. She's dealing with physical pain, emotional stress from heart issues, and her husband is pushing for sex. She's offered oral, which he's preferred in the past, but now he's pressuring her for regular sex. She's feeling bad and trying to maintain the relationship with gestures like breakfast and oral, but she's not interested in sex.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The woman has significant health issues: a colostomy bag resulting from multiple surgeries, upcoming procedures, and heart problems. These are valid reasons for physical discomfort and lack of desire. Her husband's insistence on sex despite her discomfort might be problematic. The key here is mutual respect and communication in the relationship.\n\nThe husband's behavior of grabbing her breasts and pressuring her for sex could be a form of non-consensual or coercive behavior. Even if he's saying she can \"just lay there,\" the fact that she's feeling forced is crucial. The woman is making efforts to show care through other means, like oral and breakfast, which he's accepting. This suggests she's trying to maintain intimacy within her comfort zone.\n\nIn relationships, both partners have the right to set boundaries regarding physical intimacy. If the husband is respecting her oral offerings but pushing for more, maybe he's not fully respecting her current limits. The woman's lack of interest is due to legitimate health and emotional reasons, not just disinterest in the relationship.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt and wanting to maintain the marriage are valid, but she's not necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her physical and emotional well-being. The husband's pushiness and his reaction (going out to get drunk) might indicate issues in how he's handling the situation, possibly contributing to the problem.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the woman isn't in the wrong. Her reasons are health-related, and she's making efforts to maintain the relationship within her boundaries. The husband needs to be more understanding and communicate better. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
