Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The author has a colostomy bag from surgery, which she finds embarrassing and painful during intercourse. She's also dealing with heart issues and stress. She's willing to give oral, which her husband prefers, but he's pushing for sex. He's even gotten angry and gone out to get drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has significant physical and emotional challenges. The colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment, which are valid reasons for not wanting to have penetrative sex. Her husband's persistent pressure and his reaction (getting angry and going out) might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. The fact that he's been pushing for sex despite her clear discomfort is a red flag. \n\nAlso, she's taking steps to show affection through oral and a nice breakfast, which shows she's trying to maintain intimacy in other ways. The husband's reaction seems to dismiss her feelings and needs, which could be a sign of emotional immaturity or not valuing her boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. If one partner is in pain or emotionally unavailable, the other should support them rather than force the issue. The husband's behavior here seems to lack that support. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her physical and emotional well-being. She's making an effort to meet his needs in other ways, which is commendable. \n\nConsidering all these points, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's dealing with legitimate health issues and is making efforts to maintain the relationship without compromising her comfort. The husband's pushiness and lack of empathy are the issues here.\n"
