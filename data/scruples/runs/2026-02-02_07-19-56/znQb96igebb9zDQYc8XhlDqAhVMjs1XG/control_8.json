Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband.\n\nFirst, the context: She had emergency surgery a year ago and now has a colostomy bag. There were more surgeries, and she's about to have a reversal, but there's a complication with her heart. She's under a lot of stress and health issues. She's been trying to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag. Her husband says the bag doesn't bother him, but it does her. She's been offering oral sex, which he's preferred for years. Recently, he's been pushy, trying to force sex, grabbing her, and when she resists, he gets angry and leaves to get drunk. She feels bad about not being intimate, is trying to care for him with breakfast and oral sex, but doesn't want regular sex. She's worried about her marriage and feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health issues causing physical and emotional distress, the husband's pushiness and possible coercive behavior, and her genuine lack of desire due to these factors. \n\nFrom a general perspective, consent and mutual respect in a relationship are crucial. If she's not comfortable and is experiencing pain and stress, she's not at fault for prioritizing her well-being. The husband's behavior of pressuring her and getting drunk when refused is problematic. The fact that he's been pushy and maybe not respecting her boundaries could indicate his part in the issue. She's making efforts to maintain intimacy through other means (oral sex, breakfast), which shows she's trying to meet his needs within her comfort zone.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that she's dealing with significant health challenges, the sexual activity is causing her distress, and the husband isn't respecting her boundaries by pressuring her, it seems like she's not in the wrong. The husband's actions might be contributing to the problem, but she's not obligated to engage in something that's painful and emotionally taxing for her. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
