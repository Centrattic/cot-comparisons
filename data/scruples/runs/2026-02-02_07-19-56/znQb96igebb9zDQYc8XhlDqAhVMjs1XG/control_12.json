Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's been dealing with a colostomy bag after surgeries and now has heart issues. She's been avoiding sex because it's painful and embarrassing, and her husband is pressuring her. She's offered oral sex instead, which he's preferred in the past, but recently he's been pushy about regular sex. She's tried to accommodate him but is overwhelmed with housework and kids, leading to low energy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's going through a lot of physical and emotional stress. The colostomy bag is a significant issue for her, causing pain and embarrassment. She's also dealing with heart problems and surgery uncertainty. These are major health challenges that can affect her sexual desire and ability. Her husband's pushiness and grabbing her breasts might be a form of non-consensual behavior, which is a red flag.\n\nThe key points here are her physical and emotional state, her attempts to meet his needs through oral sex, and his pressure leading to conflict. She's trying to maintain intimacy by offering oral and making breakfast, but she's clearly not comfortable with penetrative sex right now. The question is whether her refusal, given these circumstances, makes her at fault.\n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. If she's in pain and it's causing her distress, her husband should be supportive. His pressure could be seen as not respecting her boundaries, especially if he's grabbing her without consent. Her actions are about preserving her own well-being while trying to maintain the relationship. The fact that she's making an effort to show care through other means suggests she's trying to balance both their needs.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no obligation to engage in sex if it's causing harm or discomfort. The husband's pushiness might be the issue here rather than her refusal. So, considering all that, the answer is likely that she's not in the wrong. She's dealing with valid reasons and trying her best under stress.\n"
