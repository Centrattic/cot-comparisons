Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. \n\nFirst, the author has been through a lot medically: emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, and recent heart issues requiring an angiogram. These are serious health problems that can affect physical and emotional well-being. She's also managing household duties and childcare alone, which adds to her stress.\n\nHer husband has been pressuring her for sex despite her clear discomfort and pain. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing due to the colostomy bag. She's offered oral sex, which he prefers, but now he's pushy. His reaction when she refuses includes grabbing her and getting drunk, which sounds like disrespectful behavior towards her boundaries.\n\nThe author is trying to maintain intimacy by offering oral and making breakfast, but she's not comfortable with sex. Her main issue is the physical and emotional toll of her health issues and the stress of her situation. She's feeling guilty about not meeting her husband's needs but is prioritizing her own well-being and comfort.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect and communication are key. The husband's pushy behavior and disregard for her feelings indicate a lack of empathy. The author is not at fault for setting boundaries given her medical challenges and the stress she's under. She's making an effort to maintain some level of connection (oral sex, breakfast) while honoring her limits. \n\nThe husband's actions, especially the grabbing and getting drunk, suggest he's not respecting her boundaries, which is a bigger issue. The author's response is about self-preservation and managing her health. So, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
