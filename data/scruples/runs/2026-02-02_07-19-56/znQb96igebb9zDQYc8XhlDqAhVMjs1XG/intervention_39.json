Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had emergency surgery and now has a colostomy bag, which she finds embarrassing. She's been struggling with pain and emotional stress from heart issues. Her husband wants sex, but she's not up to it. He's been pushy, even grabbing her and trying to force the issue. She's offered oral sex instead, which he's preferred in the past. She's trying to show she cares by making breakfast and offering oral, but she's not wanting sex. She's worried about the marriage.\n\nSo, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but now wants my opinion. The main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author has valid reasons: physical pain, emotional stress from surgeries and heart issues, and the colostomy bag causing her embarrassment. She's also dealing with a lot of responsibilities like housework and childcare, which leaves her exhausted. Her husband is being pushy and not respecting her boundaries, even getting angry and going out to get drunk. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and pressuring her is inappropriate. The author is making an effort to meet his needs in other ways, like oral and breakfast, but when it comes to something she's genuinely not comfortable with due to health issues, she's not at fault. It's important to consider consent and emotional well-being. She's not refusing out of spite but due to legitimate physical and emotional challenges.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's lack of consideration for her current state and her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. She's not the one being inconsiderate; she's trying to balance her own health and his needs. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
