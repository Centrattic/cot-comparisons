Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves her undergoing multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, heart issues, and the husband's pushiness about sex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman has been through a lot physically\u2014emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, more surgeries, and now heart problems. Sex has been painful and embarrassing for her. She's tried to be accommodating by offering oral, which her husband prefers anyway. But recently, the husband is pressuring her for sex, even grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, her physical state makes sex difficult and painful. She's in a vulnerable position with health issues and the stress of upcoming procedures. Her husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk adds emotional tension. She's also managing housework and childcare, which drains her energy.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, if she's not physically able to consent or if there's non-consensual touching, that could be an issue. But in terms of moral or social judgment here, the key factors are her health challenges and her husband's behavior. She's making efforts to meet his needs through oral sex, which he prefers. However, she's clearly not comfortable with penetrative sex due to medical reasons and emotional stress. \n\nThe husband's pushiness and lack of consideration for her physical and emotional state might indicate an issue on his part, such as not respecting her boundaries or her medical condition. The woman is trying to maintain the relationship by offering alternatives and showing care through other means like breakfast. \n\nConsidering all this, the woman isn't in the wrong for not engaging in sex when it's causing her pain and distress. The husband may need to be more empathetic and adjust his expectations given her circumstances. The answer should reflect that she's not at fault here.\n"
