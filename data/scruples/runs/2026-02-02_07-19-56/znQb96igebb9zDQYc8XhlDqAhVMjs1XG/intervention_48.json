Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not having sex with her husband makes her the \"asshole.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation she's described. She's been through a lot: emergency surgery, a colostomy bag that's still there after three surgeries, and now heart issues requiring an angiogram. Her husband has been helpful with housework and childcare, but lately, he's been pushy about having sex. She says it's painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag, and she's been willing to give him oral sex, which he's preferred for years. Now, he's trying to force physical contact, getting angry when she resists, and she's feeling guilty and wants to maintain their marriage.\n\nSo, from her perspective, she's dealing with medical challenges that make sex painful and emotionally distressing. She's making an effort with oral and breakfast to show she cares, but she's clearly not able or willing to engage in sexual activity right now. The husband, on the other hand, is pushing for it, which might be crossing a boundary.\n\nIn terms of rights and wrongs, a lot depends on mutual respect and consent. If the husband is pressuring her and she's clearly not comfortable, then his actions might be the issue. The author isn't refusing sex out of spite or indifference; she's dealing with legitimate physical and emotional issues. She's also making an effort to maintain intimacy in other ways, which shows she's trying to meet his needs without compromising her own well-being.\n\nBut maybe some people would argue that a spouse's sexual needs are important and that she should be making more effort. However, given her medical conditions and the trauma she's undergone, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. It's also important to consider that the husband's approach of getting angry and going out to get drunk seems unhealthy and possibly the source of the problem.\n\nI think the key here is mutual understanding. If both partners are communicating and trying to meet each other's needs within their comfort zones, it's a balance. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing sex when it's causing her pain and stress. The husband's pushy behavior and lack of empathy might be the real issue here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
