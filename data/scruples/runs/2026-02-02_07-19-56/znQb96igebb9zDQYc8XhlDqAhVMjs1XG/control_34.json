Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after undergoing multiple surgeries, including a colostomy bag, and dealing with heart issues. She's been trying to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing. Her husband seems to be pressuring her, even getting angry when she resists. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has significant health challenges that make intimacy difficult. The colostomy bag is causing her distress, and she's experiencing pain. She's also dealing with heart issues, which adds to her stress and physical limitations. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, which she's not able to fulfill due to these factors. She's making an effort by offering oral sex and planning to do things like making breakfast to show she cares.\n\nThe key points here are the physical and emotional toll of her medical conditions, her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways, and her husband's pushiness. In relationships, mutual understanding and respect are crucial. If one partner is unable to engage in certain activities due to health reasons, it's important for the other partner to be supportive. The husband's reaction (getting angry and going out to get drunk) seems inappropriate and could indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nThe author isn't refusing sex out of spite but because of genuine physical and emotional barriers. She's making alternative gestures to maintain the relationship. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not meeting her husband's sexual needs when those needs are conflicting with her health. \n\nFrom a general ethical standpoint, people shouldn't be forced to do something when it's causing them physical harm or emotional distress. The husband's insistence might be the issue here. The author is taking steps to show love in other ways, which is a valid approach. Therefore, it's likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
