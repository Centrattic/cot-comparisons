Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's dealing with a colostomy bag from surgery, some heart issues, and a lot of stress. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, but she's not into it because of the physical discomfort and emotional stress. She's offering oral as an alternative, which he's preferred in the past. Now, he's getting frustrated and even leaving to get drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her circumstances. She's had multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag which is causing her embarrassment and pain, and now heart issues. That's a lot of medical stress. She's also taking care of two kids and household chores, leading to low energy. The physical and emotional toll here is significant. She's not avoiding intimacy entirely\u2014she's offering oral sex, which she knows he prefers. But she's not comfortable with penetrative sex due to her condition.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's pressuring her for sex, even when she's not in the mood. His reaction of getting angry and going out to drink is concerning. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries. If he's pressuring her despite her clear discomfort and the physical/medical issues, that's not healthy. The fact that he's been pushy lately adds to the problem.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not having sex. From what I understand, the woman is not refusing sex without reason; she's dealing with legitimate medical and emotional challenges. The husband's behavior is more problematic because he's not respecting her boundaries and her health issues. The woman is making an effort to maintain intimacy through oral sex and trying to show affection through breakfast, which indicates she's still trying to meet his needs in other ways.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The husband's actions are more concerning, and her response is appropriate given her circumstances.\n"
