Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves her undergoing multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, and recent heart issues. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, even when she's uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her situation. She's dealing with physical discomfort from the colostomy, which she finds embarrassing. She's also under a lot of medical stress and has low energy from taking care of two kids and housework. She's tried to be accommodating by offering oral sex, which her husband has preferred for years. However, he's been pushy lately, making her uncomfortable.\n\nThe husband's actions, like grabbing her breasts and pressuring her, seem coercive. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and consent. If she's not comfortable and he's pressuring her, that's on him. She's making efforts to show love through breakfast and oral, which might be what he needs, but forcing her to have sex when she's not able to is wrong.\n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong, but based on the details, it seems the husband is being inconsiderate. The author is in a vulnerable state medically and emotionally. The question is about her not having sex, but the root issue might be his behavior. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). She's not obligated to engage in sex if it's painful or unwanted. Her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways are valid. The husband needs to respect her boundaries.\n"
