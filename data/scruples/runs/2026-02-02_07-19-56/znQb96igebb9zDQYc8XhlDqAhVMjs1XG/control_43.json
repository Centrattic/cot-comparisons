Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author has been through a lot. She had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is still there despite more surgeries. She's about to have reversal surgery but has heart issues complicating that. She's been trying to have sex but it's painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag. Her husband says the bag doesn't bother him, but she's struggling with it emotionally. \n\nShe mentions that her husband has been pushy lately, grabbing her breasts and trying to get her to have sex. He even got angry and went out to get drunk when she refused. She feels bad about not fulfilling his needs and is trying to compensate with oral sex and breakfast, but she doesn't want sexual intercourse. She's also juggling childcare, housework, and her health issues, which drain her energy.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is dealing with significant physical and emotional challenges. The colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment, which are valid reasons for her not wanting to have sex. Her husband's behavior of being pushy and aggressive is concerning. Grabbing her breasts without consent and pressuring her could be a form of non-consensual behavior or emotional coercion, which is not acceptable. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the husband is pressuring her into sex without considering her feelings and physical state, that's a problem. The author's decision to avoid sex due to valid health reasons and emotional distress isn't her fault. The husband should be supportive and understanding, not pushy. \n\nAdditionally, the author is making efforts to maintain intimacy through other means like oral sex and breakfast, showing she cares. However, she feels overwhelmed and doesn't have the capacity for more. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to drink seems to be a harmful response. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might need to discuss her feelings more clearly with her husband, perhaps seeking counseling. But in this situation, the fault isn't on her for not having sex when she's in physical and emotional pain, and the husband's behavior is the issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her husband's pushiness and lack of support are the main problems here. Her reasons for avoiding sex are legitimate and valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
