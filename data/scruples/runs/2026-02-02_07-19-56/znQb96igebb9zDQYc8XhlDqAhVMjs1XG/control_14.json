Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery a year ago, leading to a colostomy bag. She's had three surgeries total, and it's still there. Her husband helps with household and childcare, but it's been a struggle. She's due for reversal surgery soon but got bad news about her heart needing an angiogram, which might delay the reversal. So, she's dealing with multiple health issues here.\n\nOver the past year, she's tried to have sex, but it's been painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag. She mentions that her husband says the bag doesn't bother him, but she's clearly affected by it. She's been offering oral sex, which her husband has preferred over regular sex for 15 years. Now, he's been pushy about having sex lately, even grabbing her and trying to force it. Last night, he got angry and went out to get drunk after she refused. She's feeling bad, trying to compensate with breakfast and oral sex to show she cares, but she's emotionally and physically drained from managing the kids, housework, and her health issues.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. She has legitimate medical and emotional reasons for not wanting to have sex. The colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment, and she's dealing with heart problems. Her husband is being pushy and even aggressive (grabbing her, getting angry, going out to get drunk). She's trying to maintain the relationship by offering alternatives and showing care in other ways. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and understanding are important. If one partner is experiencing physical or emotional distress, the other should be supportive rather than pressuring. The husband's behavior here seems to be more about his own needs without considering her current state. The author is making an effort to meet some of his needs through oral sex and other gestures, which might be the best she can manage given her circumstances. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and pressure. If he's being pushy and making her uncomfortable, that's a red flag. She's not in the wrong for not wanting to engage in something that's causing her pain and emotional stress. The fact that she's taking steps to show she cares in other ways suggests she's trying to maintain the relationship, which is commendable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her situation is complex and involves health issues that make sex painful and unpleasant for her. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
