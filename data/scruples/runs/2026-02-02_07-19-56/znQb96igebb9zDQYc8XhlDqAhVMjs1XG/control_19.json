Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she has a colostomy bag due to surgery and dealing with heart issues. She's been avoiding sex because it's painful and embarrassing, but she's been willing to do oral, which her husband prefers. Now he's pressuring her for sex, even getting upset and going out to get drunk. She's feeling bad and wants to show she cares by making breakfast and offering oral again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she's not having sex. Her health issues are a significant factor. The colostomy bag causing pain and embarrassment seems like a valid reason. She's also undergoing medical procedures and stress from heart problems. These are real physical and emotional challenges that could make intimacy difficult. It's not just about being lazy or uninterested; it's about her current state of health and well-being.\n\nThen there's the husband's reaction. He's pressuring her, using physical touch without her consent (grabbing her breasts), and getting angry when she resists. That's not healthy behavior. He needs to respect her boundaries, especially given her medical conditions. The fact that he prefers oral sex and she's still offering that shows she's trying to maintain intimacy in a way she's comfortable with. But his push for penetrative sex is causing her distress.\n\nShe's trying to balance her energy between housework, kids, and her health. She's making an effort to show care through other means like breakfast and oral, which might be the best she can do given her circumstances. The question is whether she's obligated to have sex despite her physical and emotional limits. In many relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key, especially during health challenges. Her husband should be supportive rather than demanding.\n\nThe key points here are her health issues, her willingness to engage in other forms of intimacy, and his pressure leading to conflict. Her actions seem to be in the interest of maintaining the relationship while prioritizing her health. The husband's behavior is more problematic because he's not respecting her boundaries and is reacting negatively to her limits. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for not having sex under these circumstances.\n"
