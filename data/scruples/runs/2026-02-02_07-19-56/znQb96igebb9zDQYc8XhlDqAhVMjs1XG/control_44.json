Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So the main question is whether it's wrong for her to not have sex with her husband.\n\nFirst, let's look at the details. The woman has been through a lot: emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, multiple surgeries, and now heart issues needing an angiogram. She's also dealing with the reversal surgery being in question. She says she's tried having sex but it's been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. Her husband seems to be pressuring her, even trying to force physical contact, and when she resists, he gets angry and goes out to get drunk.\n\nShe's offered oral sex instead, which the husband has preferred over regular sex for years. She's trying to make up for it with breakfast and showing care, but she's physically and emotionally drained from housework and childcare. She's worried about her marriage and feeling guilty for not meeting her husband's sexual needs.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. From what I can see, she's dealing with significant medical issues that are causing her physical discomfort and emotional stress. The colostomy bag is a major factor here, making sexual activity painful and embarrassing. She's also under a lot of stress from her health problems and taking care of two kids. Her husband's pushy behavior and his reaction (getting angry and going out) seem problematic.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" I think it's important to consider her health and well-being. If she's in pain and it's affecting her mentally, she's not at fault for not wanting to have sex. The husband's insistence might be the issue here. The fact that she's trying to maintain intimacy through other means (oral sex, breakfast) shows she's making an effort. However, she's not obligated to have sex if it's causing her physical or emotional harm. The key factors are consent, health issues, and mutual respect. Since she's not able to consent to sex when it's painful and she's not in a good mental state, she's not in the wrong. The husband might be at fault for pressuring her.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
