Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's been through multiple surgeries including a colostomy bag, and now has heart issues. She's been trying to have sex but it's painful and embarrassing. Her husband is pressuring her, even to the point of getting angry when she says no. She's been offering oral sex instead, which he's preferred for years. Now she's feeling guilty and trying to compensate with breakfast and care, but she doesn't want sex.\n\nSo, key points. She has medical reasons making sex painful and uncomfortable. She's made compromises by offering oral. The husband is being pushy and even threatening to get drunk when she resists. She's under a lot of stress from health issues and childcare, which is draining her energy.\n\nMarital advice usually emphasizes consent and mutual respect. If she's in pain and it's causing her emotional distress, forcing the issue isn't healthy. The husband's behavior sounds controlling and dismissive of her feelings. She's trying to maintain the relationship through other means, showing she's not uncaring, but her limits are valid. \n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. From what's described, she's making an effort within her comfort zone. The husband's pressure and lack of understanding seem to be the bigger issue. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). She's not obligated to do something that harms her physically or emotionally, especially with her current health challenges.\n"
