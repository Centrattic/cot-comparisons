Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the woman has been through multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, and now heart issues. She's been trying to have sex but it's painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy. She's also been doing oral sex, which her husband prefers. Recently, he's been pushy, grabbing her breasts and trying to force sex. She's been avoiding it because of physical and emotional stress, and now she's considering offering oral again and making breakfast to show she cares.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, consent and mutual respect are key. The husband's pushiness and trying to get drunk after being rejected might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. She's dealing with significant health issues and stress, which can affect her libido. She's not refusing him out of spite but due to valid physical and emotional reasons. She's still trying to maintain intimacy through other means like oral, which he prefers. \n\nIn many cultures and relationships, both partners' needs are important, but they also need to consider each other's circumstances. Her prioritizing her health and emotional state seems reasonable. Forcing sex is not acceptable regardless of the situation. The husband might need to be more understanding and less pushy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her husband's behavior is problematic. She's making efforts to show care in other ways. The answer should be B (No).\n"
