Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after undergoing surgery and dealing with health issues.\n\nFirst, the author has a colostomy bag, which is causing her pain and embarrassment. She's also dealing with heart issues and upcoming tests. That's a lot of physical and emotional stress. She's tried to have sex but it's been painful and difficult. Her husband prefers oral sex, which she's offered, but he's been pushy about full intercourse lately.\n\nThe husband is pressuring her, even grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses. The author is already stretched thin with household duties and childcare. She's making an effort to show love through breakfast and oral sex but refuses intercourse because of the pain and stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's behavior seems problematic. Pressuring someone when they're in physical and emotional pain isn't healthy. The author is doing her best to maintain intimacy in ways she's comfortable with. The question is whether she's at fault. Since she's dealing with medical issues and the husband is being pushy, the blame likely isn't on her. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. The husband needs to be more understanding of her health challenges. The author isn't in the wrong here; she's making efforts within her comfort and health limits.\n"
