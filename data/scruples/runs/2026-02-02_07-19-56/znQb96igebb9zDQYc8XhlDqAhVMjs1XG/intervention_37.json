Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after her surgeries and health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is causing her pain and embarrassment during sex. She's also dealing with heart issues and upcoming procedures. She mentions that she's been willing to give oral sex, which her husband has preferred for 15 years. Recently, he's been pushy about having sex, even grabbing her and getting angry when she resists. She's tried to show affection through breakfast and other gestures but doesn't want sex.\n\nThe key points here are the physical and emotional impact of her medical conditions, the husband's pushiness and physical pressure, and her attempts to compensate with other forms of intimacy. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not engaging in sexual relations when he wants to.\n\nI should consider consent, coercion, and mutual respect in a marriage. If the husband is pressuring her and she's in pain and emotionally distressed, that's a red flag. Her stating that she feels bad and wants to maintain the relationship shows she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. The husband's reaction of getting drunk after she refuses might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nAlso, medical conditions can affect libido and ability to engage in sex. If she's experiencing pain and emotional stress, it's reasonable she's not interested. The fact that she's willing to do oral but not intercourse shows some effort, but her comfort and health are important.\n\nI think the husband's behavior is problematic because he's pressuring her, which could be coercive. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing sex when she's not able to due to medical reasons. She's making efforts in other ways. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
