Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. I need to figure out whether she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, the context: She had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is causing her a lot of embarrassment and pain during sex. She's also dealing with heart issues and upcoming medical procedures. Her husband has been pressuring her for sex, even getting angry when she refuses. She's tried to offer oral instead, which he's preferred in the past, but she's struggling emotionally and physically. She's making an effort to care for him with breakfast and oral, but she doesn't want sex. The question is whether she's wrong for not having sex.\n\nSo, I need to consider several factors. From her perspective, there are legitimate medical and emotional reasons affecting her sexual desire. The colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment. The husband's insistence and grabbing her inappropriately could be a form of pressure or even non-consensual behavior. She's also under a lot of stress from surgeries, heart issues, and managing the household. Her efforts to maintain intimacy through other means (oral, breakfast) show she's trying to meet his needs without sex.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel neglected or unfulfilled. However, the key here is consent and mutual respect. If she's not able or willing to engage in sex due to valid reasons, that's her right. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk could be a red flag for disrespectful behavior. The fact that he's pressuring her, especially given her current physical and emotional state, might not be fair.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and find a balance. She's making an effort in other ways, but the husband's pushiness might be contributing to the problem. The author isn't refusing out of spite but due to genuine difficulties. So, it's more about the husband's approach than her being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
