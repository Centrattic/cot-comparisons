Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who has a colostomy bag due to surgery, is dealing with heart issues, and her husband is pressuring her for sex. She's trying to manage household and childcare, and the sex is painful and embarrassing for her. She's offering oral instead, which her husband prefers, but she doesn't want to have full sex anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has medical reasons making sex painful and emotional stress. She's trying to maintain intimacy through oral, which her husband has preferred in the past. The husband is pressuring her, even getting angry and going out to get drunk. The author is feeling bad about not having sex but is also physically and emotionally overwhelmed.\n\nMarital intimacy is important, but it's also a mutual agreement. If one partner is experiencing pain, medical issues, and stress, forcing the other to engage in a physical act they're uncomfortable with can be problematic. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going to get drunk is concerning. It shows a lack of empathy and understanding. The author's efforts to show care through breakfast and oral sex indicate she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not having sex. Legally or ethically, there's no obligation to have sex if it's causing harm. The husband's preference for oral doesn't mean the author has to do it if she's not comfortable. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author is under significant medical stress, and her needs are valid. The husband's pushiness is the issue here, not the author's refusal. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's dealing with legitimate health issues and is making efforts to maintain the relationship in other ways. The husband's behavior is more to blame here."
