Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves the author having a colostomy bag after surgery, which causes her pain and embarrassment during sex. Her husband has been pushing for physical intimacy, even grabbing her and trying to force it when she's not interested. She's also dealing with heart issues and has been prioritizing oral sex, which her husband prefers. She's trying to balance her energy between work, kids, and taking care of him emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect in a marriage. If one partner is uncomfortable with a specific act, especially due to physical or emotional reasons, the other partner shouldn't push them. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and getting angry suggests possible coercion, which is a red flag. The author is clearly stating she's not interested in sex because of valid reasons: pain, medical conditions, and emotional stress. She's making efforts to show care through oral and breakfast, so she's not completely neglecting intimacy.\n\nLegally and ethically, forced sexual acts without consent are wrong. However, in a marriage, there's often an expectation of intimacy, but that shouldn't override a partner's autonomy. The key here is that the author isn't refusing intimacy entirely (she's offering oral), but she's not engaging in penetrative sex. Her reasons are medical and emotional, which are valid. The husband's pushiness and anger are problematic. The author is trying to manage her health and family while still showing care. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the information, it seems the husband is the one pressuring her inappropriately. The author is in a vulnerable state due to her health issues, and her refusal isn't without effort to meet her husband's needs. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong) because she's acting within her rights to prioritize her health and comfort, and the husband's actions are the issue here.\n"
