Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of medical issues and emotional stress.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, multiple surgeries, and now heart issues. She's been struggling with pain and the emotional impact of the colostomy bag affecting her intimacy. Her husband has been trying to have sex, but she's been avoiding it, offering oral instead, which he's preferred for years. Recently, he's been pushy and even left to get drunk. She feels guilty and wants to maintain their marriage, so she's trying to make breakfast and offer oral again.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's break down the key points. The author is dealing with physical and emotional challenges due to her medical conditions. She's not avoiding intimacy entirely\u2014she's offering oral, which her husband prefers. However, she finds sex painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. The husband's pushiness and grabbing her breasts might be more of an issue. The author's refusal is due to legitimate medical reasons and emotional stress. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. If the husband is pressuring her when she's in pain and under stress, that's a problem. The fact that she's making an effort to show love through breakfast and oral suggests she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk isn't helpful either.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since her refusal is due to medical issues causing pain and emotional distress, and she's making alternative efforts to maintain intimacy, it seems she's not in the wrong. The husband might need to be more understanding and considerate of her situation. The key here is that the author isn't refusing sex out of spite or selfishness but because of real challenges. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). However, I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author does mention feeling bad and trying to make amends, which shows she's aware of his needs. The husband's behavior (grabbing and pressuring) is more concerning. So yes, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
