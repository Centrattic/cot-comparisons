Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had emergency surgery a year ago, which resulted in a colostomy bag. She's had three surgeries and hasn't had much sexual activity. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, even though she finds it painful and embarrassing. She's willing to give oral, which he's preferred for years, but she's struggling with the physical and emotional stress from her health issues, including heart problems. Recently, he's been pushy, even grabbing her and trying to force intimacy. She's feeling guilty and wants to maintain their marriage but doesn't want to have sex.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's health challenges, the physical discomfort and emotional distress from the colostomy bag, the husband's pushy behavior, and her efforts to maintain intimacy through other means like oral sex and breakfast. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is not unwilling in general but is physically and emotionally unable to engage in sex due to medical reasons. The husband's pressure, especially his grabbing and trying to force sex, could be a form of coercion or even abuse. The fact that she's made compromises (oral sex, breakfast) shows she's trying to meet his needs in ways she can. \n\nThe husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk after she refuses is concerning. Healthy relationships require communication and understanding, especially when one partner is dealing with significant health issues. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and comfort. She's making an effort to show care through other means, which is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's navigating a difficult situation with her health and is making reasonable efforts to maintain the relationship within her physical and emotional limits.\n"
