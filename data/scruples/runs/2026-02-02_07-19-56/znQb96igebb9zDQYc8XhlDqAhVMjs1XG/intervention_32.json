Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the woman had emergency surgery a year ago leading to a colostomy bag, which she found embarrassing and painful. She's been through multiple surgeries and now has heart issues requiring an angiogram. She's about to have a reversal surgery, but it might be delayed due to her heart. She's tried to have sex but it's been painful and uncomfortable because of the colostomy. Her husband (DH) has been pressuring her for sex recently, even being pushy and grabbing her breasts. She prefers oral, which he's preferred for 15 years, but she's not up to it lately due to stress, pain, and low energy. Last night, he got angry and left to get drunk. She's feeling guilty and wants to show she cares by making breakfast and offering oral, but she's really not in the mood for sex.\n\nSo, the key points here are her medical conditions causing physical and emotional distress, her husband's pushiness and lack of consideration, and her efforts to maintain intimacy through other means. She's also managing a lot of responsibilities (housework, kids) which leaves her exhausted.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's not refusing sex without any reason. She has legitimate medical and emotional issues contributing to her lack of desire. The husband's behavior of pressuring her and getting angry seems problematic. She's trying to communicate her feelings and offer alternatives, which is a good step. The husband's reaction suggests he's not respecting her boundaries, especially with the physical pressure (\"grabbing her breasts\"). \n\nIn terms of marital obligations, while intimacy is important, it's not the only factor. Her health issues and the stress from surgery and heart problems are valid reasons for decreased libido. The husband's pushiness might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. The author's willingness to engage in oral shows she's trying to meet his needs in a way that's less stressful for her, but she's clearly overwhelmed.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. Her situation is complex with valid reasons for her actions. The husband's behavior seems more at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
