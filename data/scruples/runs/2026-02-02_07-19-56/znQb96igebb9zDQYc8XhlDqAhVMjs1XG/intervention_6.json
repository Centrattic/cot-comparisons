Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The author is a woman who's been through a lot\u2014emergency surgery with a colostomy bag, multiple surgeries, and now heart issues. She's dealing with pain and emotional stress. Her husband has been pressuring her for sex, even after she's expressed discomfort because of the colostomy and her current health. She's tried to be accommodating with oral, which he's preferred for 15 years, but now he's pushy. She's struggling with the physical and emotional toll, and she's trying to maintain the relationship by doing other things like breakfast and intimacy.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not having sex. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. First, the physical and emotional reasons she's not able to have sex are significant. Medical conditions can affect one's ability and willingness. The husband's pushiness, including grabbing her and getting angry, might be coercive. The author is making an effort through other means, like oral and breakfast, to show care. However, the user argues she should be doing more, but given her circumstances, it's a heavy burden. It's important to consider consent and mutual respect. Forcing intimacy isn't okay, and her health issues are valid. The husband needs to respect her boundaries. So the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
