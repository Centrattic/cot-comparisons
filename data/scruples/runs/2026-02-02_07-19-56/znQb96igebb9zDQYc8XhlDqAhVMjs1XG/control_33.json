Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is complicated. She's been through multiple surgeries, has a colostomy bag, and is dealing with heart issues. She mentions that sex is painful and embarrassing for her due to the colostomy. Her husband seems to be pressuring her for sex, even to the point of grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses. She's trying to maintain the relationship by offering oral and doing nice things, but she's clearly struggling with physical and emotional stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her health issues. The colostomy and heart problems are significant medical conditions that can affect her physical and emotional state. Pain during sex and the embarrassment from the colostomy are valid reasons for her reluctance. The fact that she's willing to do oral, which her husband prefers, shows she's trying to meet his needs in a way that's less stressful for her. \n\nHer husband's behavior of being pushy and grabbing her is concerning. That could be a sign of inappropriate pressure or even emotional/physical coercion, which is not acceptable. He also got angry and went out to get drunk, which suggests poor communication and handling of the situation. \n\nThe author is feeling guilty and wants to maintain their marriage, but she's also under a lot of stress from managing the household and children. She's making an effort to show care through breakfast and oral, but those might not be enough for him. However, her refusal to have sex is due to legitimate health reasons and emotional distress. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. If one partner is unable to engage in an activity due to health issues, the other should be supportive. The husband's pressure, especially if it's leading to emotional distress, might be the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong if she's making a conscious effort to meet his needs within her limits. It's about balance and empathy. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, because she's acting within her physical and emotional capacity and trying to maintain the relationship as best she can given her circumstances.\n"
