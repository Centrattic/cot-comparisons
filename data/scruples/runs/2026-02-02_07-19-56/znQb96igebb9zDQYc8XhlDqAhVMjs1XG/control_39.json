Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not having sex with her husband after a series of surgeries and health issues. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which she found embarrassing and painful during sex. Her husband says it doesn't bother him, but she's struggling. She's also dealing with a heart issue requiring an angiogram, adding to her stress. Over the past 15 years, her husband preferred oral sex, and recently he's been pushy about having regular sex. Last night, he pushed her again, got angry, and went out to get drunk. She wants to maintain intimacy but can't bring herself to have sex due to physical and emotional reasons. She's trying to show love through other means like oral sex and breakfast.\n\nSo, the main points: She's dealing with medical issues that make sex painful and emotionally distressing. Her husband isn't respecting her boundaries and is pressuring her. She's making efforts in other ways but not in the way he wants. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication. If she's physically and emotionally unable to have sex due to valid medical reasons and he's not being supportive but instead pushy, then she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior of grabbing and pressuring her is inappropriate. The author is trying to maintain the relationship through other acts of love, which is reasonable. She's also aware of the need for intimacy but is doing what she can within her limits. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's dealing with significant health challenges and the husband is not being supportive. The responsibility here leans more on the husband to be patient and understanding rather than pressuring her.\n"
