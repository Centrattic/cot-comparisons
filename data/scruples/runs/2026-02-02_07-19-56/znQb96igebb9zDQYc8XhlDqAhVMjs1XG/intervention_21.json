Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of medical issues: a colostomy bag from surgery, heart problems, and the stress of upcoming procedures. She's been trying to have sex but it's painful and embarrassing for her. Her husband is pressuring her, and she's considered offering oral sex instead, which he prefers. She's feeling guilty and is trying to show affection through other means like breakfast and intimacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's dealing with physical and emotional challenges. The colostomy bag is causing her distress, and the surgeries and heart issues add to her stress. She mentions it's been painful and she's embarrassed. That's a lot to handle. The husband's reaction when she refuses is getting angry and going out to get drunk. That's not healthy behavior either. \n\nIn terms of marital expectations, there's no one-size-fits-all. But given her medical conditions and the resulting emotional toll, it's reasonable that she's not up for sex. She's making an effort with oral sex and other gestures, which might be the best she can do right now. The husband's pushiness and pressure could be part of the problem here. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points are her health issues affecting her ability to engage in sex, her willingness to find alternatives, and the husband's response. Since she's making an effort to maintain a connection but has valid reasons for not wanting intercourse, it's more about mutual understanding and support. The husband's behavior might be contributing to the problem, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing her health and comfort. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
