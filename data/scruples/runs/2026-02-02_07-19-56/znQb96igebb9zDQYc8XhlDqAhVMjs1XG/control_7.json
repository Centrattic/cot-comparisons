Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. First, I need to consider the context she provided. She's dealing with a colostomy bag from multiple surgeries and a heart issue. The husband is pressuring her for sex, which she finds painful and embarrassing. She's been willing to give oral sex, which he prefers, but now he's pushing for actual sex. She's also stressed from taking care of the kids and housework, leaving her with no energy.\n\nSo, the key factors here are her medical conditions affecting her ability to engage in sex, the physical and emotional pain involved, and her husband's insistence despite her clear discomfort. The question is whether she's at fault. \n\nIn many relationships, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. If she's been upfront about her issues and the husband isn't respecting her boundaries, that's a problem. The husband grabbing her and trying to have sex when she's not willing could be a form of non-consensual behavior, especially if she's not consenting due to unwillingness. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if she's wrong. She's making efforts to show affection through oral sex and breakfast, trying to maintain the relationship. The physical and emotional toll of her health issues is significant. It's important to consider that her lack of desire isn't just about not wanting sex but is due to valid medical and emotional reasons. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether her reasons are legitimate and if the husband is respecting her. Since she's made efforts to meet his needs in other ways (oral sex) and is clearly communicating her inability to have sex due to valid reasons, she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior, pushing for sex despite her distress, might be the issue here. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
