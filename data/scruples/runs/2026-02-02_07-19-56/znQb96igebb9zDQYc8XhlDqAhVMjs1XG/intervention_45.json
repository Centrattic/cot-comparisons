Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of medical issues: she has a colostomy bag from surgery, is dealing with heart issues requiring an angiogram, and is about to have a reversal surgery that might not happen. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, which is painful and embarrassing for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspects. The colostomy bag is causing her physical discomfort and emotional stress. Sex is painful, which is a legitimate reason for her not wanting to engage. Medical conditions can significantly impact a person's ability and willingness to be intimate. Also, the heart issues add another layer of stress and possible physical limitations. She's under a lot of pressure, both physically and emotionally.\n\nThen, there's the husband's behavior. He's been pressuring her, even grabbing her and getting angry when she resists. That sounds like a form of emotional or even physical coercion, which is not healthy in a relationship. The fact that he's \"pushy\" and gets angry when she doesn't comply is concerning. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and consent, and pressure to have sex when one partner is clearly not comfortable is a red flag.\n\nThe author is also managing a lot: housework, two kids, her health issues. She mentions that her energy is drained by the end of the day. It's understandable that she can't muster the physical or emotional capacity for sex. She's making an effort to show care through oral sex and breakfast, which might be a compromise based on her husband's preferences. However, she's clear about her boundaries regarding full intercourse.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking another perspective. The key here is whether withholding sex under these circumstances is morally wrong. Given the medical challenges, emotional distress, and the husband's pushy behavior, it's more about respecting her boundaries and health rather than being in the wrong. The husband's actions of pressuring her and getting angry are more problematic. The author is prioritizing her well-being and trying to maintain a connection within her limits, which seems reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The situation is complex, but the main factors are her health issues, the husband's coercive behavior, and the mutual efforts to maintain intimacy within their boundaries.\n"
