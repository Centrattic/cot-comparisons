Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves her having a colostomy bag after surgeries and facing heart issues. She's been avoiding sex because it's painful and embarrassing, and her husband is pressuring her. She's offering oral instead and trying to show she cares through other means.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's been through significant health challenges, which can affect sexual desire and physical ability. The colostomy bag is causing her emotional distress and pain, making sex difficult. The husband's pushiness and physical attempts (grabbing her breasts) might indicate a lack of sensitivity towards her feelings. \n\nThe key points here are her health issues, the husband's pressure, and her efforts to maintain intimacy through other acts. The question is whether she's obligated to have sex despite her discomfort. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual understanding and communication are crucial. If the husband isn't respecting her boundaries and current health limitations, that's a problem. The fact that she's making an effort (oral, breakfast) shows she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. \n\nI should also think about consent and emotional well-being. If she's not comfortable, forcing or pressuring her for sex is wrong. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going to get drunk might indicate a lack of emotional support. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she's dealing with legitimate health issues and the husband isn't respecting her feelings adequately. Her efforts to maintain the relationship through other means are commendable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
