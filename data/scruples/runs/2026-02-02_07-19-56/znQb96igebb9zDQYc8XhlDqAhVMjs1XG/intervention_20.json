Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who refuses to have sex with her husband due to medical issues and emotional stress. She's had surgeries, a colostomy bag, heart issues, and is dealing with a lot of stress. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, which she finds painful and embarrassing. She's tried to be accommodating by offering oral, which he prefers, but now he's getting pushy and even threatening to get drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is dealing with significant health challenges that are affecting her physical and emotional state. The husband's insistence on sex, despite her clear reluctance and pain, is a red flag. It's important to note that mutual respect and consent are crucial in any relationship. Pressuring someone into sexual activity when they're not comfortable is not healthy.\n\nThe woman has made efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways, like offering oral, which the husband seems to prefer. She's also trying to show her care through breakfast and other gestures. Her reasons for not engaging in sex are valid and rooted in her medical conditions. She's not refusing out of spite but due to physical limitations and emotional distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction\u2014grabbing her, pressuring her, and getting angry\u2014could indicate a lack of understanding or empathy. Healthy relationships require communication and compromise. If the husband is making her feel forced, that's a problem. The fact that he's been pushy and then leaves to get drunk suggests he's not handling the situation constructively.\n\nThe key points here are the woman's health issues, her efforts to maintain the relationship in other ways, and the husband's coercive behavior. In terms of right or wrong, the woman is not at fault for prioritizing her health and comfort. The husband is in the wrong for pressuring her and not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
