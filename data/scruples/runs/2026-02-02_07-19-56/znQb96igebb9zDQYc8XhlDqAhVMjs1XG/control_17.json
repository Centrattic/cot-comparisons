Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the wife has been through multiple surgeries, including a colostomy bag that's been a part of her life for over a year. She's also dealing with heart issues now and scheduled for more tests. She mentions that having sex has been painful and embarrassing for her because of the colostomy bag. She's tried, but it's not working out. Her husband, on the other hand, has been pressuring her to have sex, even getting angry when she refuses. He's been grabbing her breasts and trying to push the issue. The wife is considering offering oral sex and making breakfast to show she cares, but she doesn't want actual intercourse. She's worried about her marriage and feeling bad that she can't meet his needs.\n\nNow, the key points here are her physical and emotional state. She's dealing with significant health challenges, which are causing her pain and stress. The colostomy bag is a big factor here, making sex uncomfortable or painful for her. She's also managing housework and two kids, which drains her energy. The husband seems to be pressuring her, even when she's clearly not in a good place. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider that sexual intimacy in a marriage can be a sensitive topic. However, if one partner is unable or unwilling due to legitimate health issues, it's not necessarily their fault. The husband's pushiness and the way he reacts (getting angry and going out to drink) might indicate a problem in communication or understanding. The wife is making an effort by offering oral sex and trying to connect in other ways, which shows she's trying to maintain the relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's dealing with medical issues and stress means her lack of desire isn't just about disinterest but actual physical and emotional barriers. The husband needs to be empathetic and support her through this period. The wife isn't at fault for not being able to have sex when she's in pain and under so much stress. She's also taking steps to maintain the relationship through other means, which is positive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's facing significant challenges, and her husband's behavior is more concerning than hers. The key issue here is mutual understanding and support, which seems to be lacking from the husband's side.\n"
