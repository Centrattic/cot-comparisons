Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is pretty complex. She's had multiple surgeries, a colostomy bag, heart issues, and is dealing with a lot of stress. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, which she finds painful and embarrassing. She's tried to compromise with oral, which he prefers, but now he's getting pushy and even aggressive. She's also managing household and kids, which drains her energy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is dealing with significant health issues that affect her physical and emotional state. The colostomy bag is causing her distress, and the heart problems add more stress. Having sex is painful for her, which is a valid reason to avoid it. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and pushing for sex could be a red flag, maybe even a form of coercion or disrespecting her boundaries. \n\nThe author is making an effort by offering oral and planning to make breakfast, showing she cares about his needs. However, she's clearly not in the right mental or physical state to engage in sexual activity. The key here is whether her refusal is justified given her circumstances. \n\nIn many cases, if someone is in a lot of pain or has valid medical reasons, it's not their fault for not being able to fulfill sexual expectations. Additionally, the husband's pushiness might be contributing to the problem. The author is trying to maintain the relationship through other means, which is positive. \n\nSo, based on this, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's dealing with a lot and is making efforts within her capacity. The husband might need to be more understanding and less forceful. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
