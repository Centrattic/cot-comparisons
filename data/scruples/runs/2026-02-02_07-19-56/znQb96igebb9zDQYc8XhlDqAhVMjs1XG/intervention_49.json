Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the A**hole?\" post is in the wrong for not having sex with their husband. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery with a colostomy bag, which they've had for over a year. They mention it's been painful and embarrassing to have sex because of the bag. The husband, on the other hand, says the colostomy bag doesn't bother him and has been pushy about having sex recently. He even grabbed her breasts and tried to force it, then got angry and went out to get drunk when she refused. The author is considering offering oral and making breakfast to show she cares but doesn't want sex. They're worried about the marriage and feel bad making him feel unwanted.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's the case. Let's look at the key points here. The author is experiencing physical pain and emotional distress due to the colostomy bag and heart issues. These are significant medical conditions that can affect one's ability and desire to engage in sexual activity. The husband's behavior of being pushy, grabbing her, and then becoming angry and going to get drunk might be a red flag. That sounds like pressure, maybe even coercive behavior, which is not healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe author is trying to maintain intimacy through other means like oral sex, which the husband has preferred for 15 years. So she's accommodating his preferences in that regard. She's also dealing with a lot of stress and responsibilities, taking care of two kids and housework, which leaves her with low energy. It's important to consider the physical and emotional toll of her medical conditions here. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels, especially when there are medical issues involved. The husband should be supportive and understanding rather than demanding. The author is making efforts to show love and care through other gestures, which is valid. The issue seems more on the husband's side for not respecting her current situation and boundaries.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
