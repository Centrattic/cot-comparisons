Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The context is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author has had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is still there after two more surgeries. She's going through a reversal surgery but has new heart issues. The husband is pressuring her for sex, even physically grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses. The author is in physical and emotional pain, has low energy, and is taking care of two kids and housework. She's willing to do oral, which the husband prefers, but can't bring herself to have sex. She's trying to show care through breakfast and oral, but it's causing her significant stress and anxiety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author has valid reasons for not engaging in sexual intercourse. The husband's behavior\u2014pressuring, grabbing her, and getting angry\u2014seems unhealthy and potentially coercive. The author is making an effort to meet some of his needs (oral) and show affection. The physical and emotional circumstances are significant factors here. Her husband should be supportive given her health issues and the stress she's under. The fact that she's trying to maintain the relationship through other gestures suggests she cares, but the situation is complex. The main issue here is the husband's pressure and lack of empathy towards her current state. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and comfort, especially under these circumstances.\n"
