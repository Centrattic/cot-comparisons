Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman had emergency surgery resulting in a colostomy bag. She's been through multiple surgeries and is dealing with a lot of physical discomfort and emotional stress. She's also facing heart issues and an uncertain surgery plan. Her husband, while helping with household and childcare, has become pushy about having sex recently. She's offered oral sex, which he's preferred for 15 years, but she's physically and emotionally unable to engage in intercourse due to the colostomy bag's embarrassment and pain. Last night, he pushed her, got angry when she refused, and went out to get drunk. She's trying to maintain the relationship with breakfast and oral, but she's exhausted from her responsibilities and health issues.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. From what I read, she's made compromises, like offering oral, but her physical and emotional state is a significant barrier. The husband's behavior of pressuring her and getting angry seems problematic. Her reasons for not having sex are health-related and not a choice she's making lightly. She's also trying to show care in other ways. The husband's response to her refusal (getting angry and drinking) is a red flag. It sounds like the issue isn't just about her not wanting sex but his inability to respect her boundaries given her circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's dealing with valid health issues and stress, and her actions are an attempt to maintain the relationship within her limits.\n"
