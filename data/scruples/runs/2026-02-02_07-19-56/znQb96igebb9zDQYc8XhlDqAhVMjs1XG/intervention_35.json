Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not having sex with their husband. The author has been through a lot\u2014emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, more surgeries, and now heart issues. They mention that sex has been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. The husband has been pressuring them for sex recently, even to the point of getting angry and going out to get drunk. The author is offering oral sex, which the husband has preferred in the past, and is trying to show affection through breakfast and other gestures.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with physical and emotional challenges. The colostomy bag is causing them distress, and they've had pain during sex. The husband's actions seem to be pressuring them into something they're not comfortable with. The author is trying to maintain the relationship but has valid reasons for not wanting sex. \n\nIn terms of rights, in many relationships, especially marriages, mutual respect and consent are key. The husband's behavior of grabbing and pressuring might be inappropriate. The author is not refusing out of spite but due to medical and emotional reasons. \n\nI should also think about cultural and societal norms. Some might expect a spouse to fulfill sexual needs, but that's changing as more awareness is given to consent and health issues. The author is making efforts to maintain the relationship through other means, which shows they care. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is now seeking an opinion. I need to check if there's any expectation that the author should comply despite their circumstances. But considering the health issues and the husband's pushy behavior, it's more about the husband not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have legitimate reasons and are making efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. The husband's actions are more questionable here.\n"
