Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves a lot of personal and medical challenges.\n\nFirst, the author had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is still with her despite more surgeries. She's dealing with the physical and emotional impact of that, including pain and embarrassment during intimacy. She's also facing heart issues requiring an angiogram, which adds to her stress. Her husband, on the other hand, has been pushing for sex, even when she's not up for it, and his behavior seems to be becoming more demanding, even leading to him getting angry and going out to get drunk.\n\nThe author has tried to maintain intimacy through oral sex, which her husband prefers. But recently, she's been unable to go through with it due to the physical and emotional toll. She's making an effort to show care through breakfast and oral, but she's emotionally drained from managing household and kids, leaving no energy for more.\n\nFrom a rights and responsibilities perspective, in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and needs. The husband's pushiness and disregard for her feelings during these times are concerning. The author's reasons are valid\u2014medical conditions, pain, emotional stress. She's making efforts in other ways, which shows she's trying to maintain the relationship but has limits. The husband needs to be more empathetic and considerate of her health and emotional state. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and communicating her boundaries. The husband's reaction (getting angry and drinking) is also a problem. So, the answer is B.\n"
