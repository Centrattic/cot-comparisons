Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. I need to figure out the answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, let me read through the situation again. The woman had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which is still there after three surgeries. Her husband is helping with household and childcare, but it's been a struggle. She's about to have a reversal surgery but got bad news about her heart needing an angiogram, which might affect her surgery. She's tried to have sex, but it's been painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy. She's been willing to give oral sex, which her husband prefers. Lately, he's been pushy, grabbed her breasts, and tried to force sex. She's been physically and emotionally drained from all the medical issues, taking care of two kids, and housework. She's feeling bad about not fulfilling his needs and trying to make it up to him with breakfast and oral sex but not having actual sex. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are her physical and emotional state, the impact of the colostomy and heart issues, her husband's pushiness and possible forceful behavior, and her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. \n\nFrom what I understand, in relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. If she's experiencing pain and emotional distress, and he's not respecting her boundaries by being pushy and trying to force physical intimacy, that's a red flag. His behavior could be considered emotionally abusive. On her side, she's making an effort with oral sex and breakfast to show she cares, which might be her way of maintaining intimacy despite her limitations. She's also dealing with a lot of health issues, which can significantly affect libido and ability to engage in sex.\n\nIn many cultures and ethical standards, consent and mutual willingness are key. If she's not willing due to valid reasons (pain, emotional trauma, health issues) and he's pressuring her, he might be at fault. However, if the question is about her not having sex at all, but she's trying other ways, maybe she's not in the wrong. It's important to consider the context of her circumstances\u2014she's under a lot of stress and has medical conditions that make sex difficult. \n\nLegally and ethically, if he's pressuring her into unwanted sex, that's a problem. But if the question is about her not fulfilling his sexual needs, the answer might be different. However, given the context of her health and his behavior, it seems like she's not in the wrong. She's making an effort in other ways, which is important for a relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her husband's pushiness and her health issues are significant factors here. She's trying to maintain the relationship as best as she can under difficult circumstances. The husband needs to be more understanding and communicate better, respecting her boundaries. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
