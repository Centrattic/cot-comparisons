Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nSo, the woman has been through multiple surgeries, including a colostomy bag, which she finds embarrassing and painful during sex. Her husband has been pressuring her for sex, even grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses. She's also dealing with heart issues and the stress of upcoming procedures. She's been offering oral sex instead, which her husband has preferred for years. Now, she's trying to balance caring for two kids, housework, and her own health, leaving her exhausted. She's trying to make breakfast and offer oral to show she cares, but she doesn't want sex. She's worried about the marriage and feels terrible about not meeting his needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman has legitimate health issues causing physical pain and emotional distress. The colostomy bag is a significant factor affecting her comfort and willingness to engage in sexual activity. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses is problematic. Pressuring someone for sex when they're not comfortable, especially given medical reasons, is not healthy. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels. The husband's insistence on sex despite her reasons could be seen as coercive. The fact that she's making an effort to show affection through other means (oral, breakfast) indicates she's trying to maintain intimacy without compromising her physical and emotional well-being.\n\nMarital relationships require mutual understanding and adaptability. Given the medical challenges, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her health and set boundaries. The husband's reaction (getting angry and going out to get drunk) is unhealthy and doesn't address the underlying issues constructively. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not having sex under these circumstances. The key points are her health issues, the husband's pressuring behavior, and her efforts to maintain the relationship through other forms of intimacy. The responsibility here isn't on her for not meeting his sexual needs when there are valid reasons and his response is inappropriate.\n"
