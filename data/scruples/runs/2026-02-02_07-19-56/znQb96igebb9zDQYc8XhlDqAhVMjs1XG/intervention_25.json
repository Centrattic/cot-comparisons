Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she has a colostomy bag due to surgeries and is dealing with heart issues. Her husband wants sex, but she's not interested because of the pain, embarrassment from the colostomy, and stress from her health problems. She's been offering oral sex, which he prefers, but she's feeling pressured and has been avoiding penetrative sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her circumstances. She's been through a lot medically, which is causing her physical discomfort and emotional stress. The colostomy bag is a significant change that's affecting her confidence and comfort in sexual situations. She's also dealing with the possibility that her reversal surgery might not happen, which adds more anxiety. On top of that, she's managing household duties and childcare, which drains her energy.\n\nHer husband is trying to initiate sex, but she's not able to because of the reasons mentioned. She feels she's not meeting his needs, which is causing marital tension. She's making an effort to show care through oral sex and breakfast, but she's clear she doesn't want penetrative sex right now. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not having sex with him. The key factors here are her medical conditions and the emotional impact they're having on her. Is her refusal justified given her health issues and the resulting pain and embarrassment? Also, her husband's approach\u2014grabbing her breasts and trying to coerce her\u2014might be part of the problem. If he's being pushy and not respecting her boundaries, that could shift the responsibility away from her.\n\nIn many relationships, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. She's making an effort to maintain intimacy through oral sex, which her husband prefers. However, she's not comfortable with penetrative sex due to valid medical reasons. It's possible that her husband isn't considering her current physical and emotional state, leading to pressure that she can't meet. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about marital intimacy, but from a compassionate standpoint, her health issues are significant barriers. She's trying to show care in other ways but isn't able to fulfill his desire for penetrative sex. If the husband is being disrespectful or not accommodating her situation, the responsibility isn't on her. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
