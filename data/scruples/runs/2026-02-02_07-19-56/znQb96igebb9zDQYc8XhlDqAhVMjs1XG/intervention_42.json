Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The author has been through a lot: emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, more surgeries, heart issues, and upcoming procedures. She mentions that sex has been painful and embarrassing due to the colostomy. Her husband is pushing for it, even grabbing her breasts and pressuring her to just \"lay there,\" which leads to him getting upset and going out to get drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with medical issues that make sex physically painful and emotionally distressing. She's also under a lot of stress from her health problems and managing household duties with two kids. She's willing to offer oral sex, which her husband has preferred for years. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and pressuring her seems coercive, which is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities in a marriage, intimacy is important, but it's not the only factor. The author has valid reasons for not engaging in intercourse: medical reasons, pain, and emotional distress. The husband's reaction of getting angry and drinking might indicate a lack of understanding or empathy. \n\nI should think about whether the author is at fault. She's trying to maintain a connection by offering oral sex and making breakfast, showing she cares about his needs but has her limits. The key issue here is whether she's in the wrong for refusing sex when it's causing her pain and distress. \n\nLegally and ethically, consent and mutual willingness are crucial. If sex is causing her pain and she's not comfortable, she's not obligated to engage. The husband's insistence without considering her feelings could be problematic. However, the author might feel guilty for not meeting his needs, but her health and well-being are also important.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with significant health challenges, and the husband needs to be more understanding. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
