Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves her having a colostomy bag from multiple surgeries, recent heart issues, and her husband pressuring her for sex despite her discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been through significant physical and emotional stressors. The colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment, and she's dealing with heart problems that might affect her surgery. She mentions trying to be intimate by offering oral sex, which her husband prefers, but he's pushing for full intercourse now. \n\nHer husband's response is getting aggressive, grabbing her, and then threatening to get drunk. That seems like a red flag. Emotional manipulation or pressure can be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship. The author is clearly under a lot of stress, both physically and mentally, from her health issues and caring for the kids and housework. She's feeling guilty but also overwhelmed.\n\nFrom a general perspective, in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels. If the husband is pressuring her when she's not willing or able, that's a problem. The author is making an effort to show care through other means, like oral sex and breakfast, which indicates she's trying to meet his needs in ways she feels comfortable. \n\nHowever, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking a second opinion. The key factors here are consent, mutual respect, and the health of both partners. The author isn't refusing out of spite but due to legitimate physical and emotional reasons. The husband's behavior seems to be the issue here, as he's not respecting her boundaries and is acting out when his needs aren't met. \n\nIn this situation, the author isn't at fault for not engaging in sex when it's causing her distress. The responsibility lies more with the husband for his pressuring behavior and not supporting her through her health challenges. The author is making efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways, which is commendable. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
