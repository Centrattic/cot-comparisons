Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. She's had some serious health issues\u2014emergency surgery, a colostomy bag that's been there for a year despite three surgeries, and now heart problems with an angiogram coming up. The reversal surgery for the colostomy might not happen as planned. \n\nHer husband has been pushy about having sex lately, even grabbing her breasts and pressuring her. She's tried to have sex but found it painful and embarrassing because of the colostomy bag. She prefers oral, which he's almost preferred over regular sex for years. She's been feeling too drained from taking care of the kids and housework, and the emotional stress of her health issues makes her not interested. Last night he got angry and said he'd go out to get drunk.\n\nShe's feeling bad about not having sex and is trying to show she cares by making breakfast and offering oral, but she doesn't want sex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. The colostomy bag is causing her physical pain and emotional distress. She's also dealing with heart issues, which adds to the stress. Her energy levels are low due to the demands of household and childcare. These are significant factors that can affect someone's ability and desire to engage in sexual activity. \n\nHer husband's behavior of pressuring her and getting angry seems problematic. Consent should be mutual, and if she's not comfortable, that's her right. The fact that he's been pushy lately might indicate that he's not respecting her boundaries, especially given her health issues. \n\nShe's making an effort to maintain intimacy through other means (oral, breakfast) which might meet his needs without the full sex act. It's important that relationships adapt to changing circumstances, and her situation has clearly changed due to health. \n\nIs she in the wrong for not having sex? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate and respect each other's needs and limitations. If she's unable or unwilling due to valid reasons, and he's pressuring her despite her clear discomfort, then she's not the one at fault. The responsibility is on both sides to find a middle ground. \n\nI think the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. Her health issues and the associated discomforts are legitimate reasons to not want sex. The husband's pushiness and anger are more concerning. The key is mutual respect and communication, which she's trying to do by offering alternatives and discussing it.\n"
