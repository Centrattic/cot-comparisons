Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband despite his insistence. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been through a lot medically. She had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag, which she finds embarrassing and painful in the context of sex. She's also dealing with heart issues now. Her husband has been pressuring her for sex, even when she's not interested, and she's tried alternatives like oral, which he prefers. He gets upset when she resists, even threatening to go out drunk. She's making an effort to show affection through breakfast and oral, but she's physically and emotionally drained from her health issues, surgeries, and taking care of their kids.\n\nSo, the main factors here are her medical conditions affecting her ability and willingness to engage in sex, her husband's pushiness, and her efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. The question is whether she's at fault. \n\nLegally or ethically, in many contexts, consent and mutual willingness are key. If she's not able or willing due to valid reasons (health issues, pain, stress), and she's communicating this, then she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior of pressuring her and getting angry could be problematic. The author is trying to meet his needs in other ways, which shows she's making an effort. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because her reasons are valid, she's making compromises, and the husband's actions (pushing for sex when she's not comfortable) are the issue here. The situation is complex, but the fault lies more with the husband's persistence despite her clear discomfort.\n"
