Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is pretty complex. She's been through a lot: emergency surgery, a colostomy bag, more surgeries, and now heart issues. Her husband has been pushing for sex, even grabbing her and pressuring her, which makes her uncomfortable. She's tried to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing for her. She prefers oral, which he's liked in the past, but now he's pushing for actual intercourse. She's also dealing with a lot of stress from the kids, housework, her health stuff, and the upcoming angiogram.\n\nSo, the main points here are her health issues affecting her ability and willingness to have sex, her husband's pressure and physical actions (grabbing her), and her efforts to show affection through other means like oral and breakfast. The question is whether she's at fault for not engaging in intercourse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her reasons are valid. Physical health issues, especially something as significant as a colostomy bag and heart problems, can definitely impact sexual desire and ability. The pain and embarrassment she mentions are legitimate barriers. Then there's the emotional stress from all her medical issues and family responsibilities. That's a lot to handle.\n\nHer husband's behavior is also a factor. Pressuring her and grabbing her breasts without consent is not okay. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he's pressuring her in a way that makes her uncomfortable, even if he's not physically abusive, it's a form of emotional pressure that can be harmful. The fact that he went out to get drunk after she refused might indicate frustration or that he's not handling the situation well.\n\nShe's making an effort by offering oral and breakfast, showing she still wants to maintain intimacy, but on her terms. The key here is that she's not refusing intimacy entirely but is making choices based on her physical and emotional state. The husband's needs are valid, but they shouldn't override her well-being, especially when she's dealing with health issues.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's important to recognize that both partners should communicate and find a balance. However, in this case, the author's health and emotional state are significant factors. The husband's actions (grabbing her, pressuring her) cross a line into potential emotional or physical coercion, which isn't acceptable. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and comfort, especially when her husband hasn't been supportive of her needs either.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her situation is valid, and the husband's pressure is problematic. She's managing a lot and making efforts in different ways. It's not just about sex but about mutual respect and understanding in the relationship.\n"
