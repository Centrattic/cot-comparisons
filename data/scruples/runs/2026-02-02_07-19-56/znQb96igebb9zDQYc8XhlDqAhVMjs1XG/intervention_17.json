Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after undergoing multiple surgeries and dealing with health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has had emergency surgery leading to a colostomy bag and more surgeries. She's about to have a reversal, but there's a heart issue complicating things. She's been trying to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing. She's offered oral, which her husband prefers, but recently he's been pushy about having sex, even getting angry when she refuses. She's feeling stressed, overwhelmed with household and kids, and is trying to make amends with breakfast and oral to show she cares. She's worried about her marriage and feeling bad about not having sex.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. She's dealing with physical health issues that make sex painful and emotionally difficult. Her husband, on the other hand, wants sex and is pushing her. The pushiness and his reaction (getting angry and going out to get drunk) seem problematic. The author is making efforts (oral, breakfast) to maintain intimacy but isn't comfortable with sex. She's also under a lot of stress from health issues, surgeries, and daily responsibilities.\n\nFrom a general perspective, consent and mutual respect are crucial in a relationship. If the husband is pressuring her and it's causing her distress, that's a red flag. The author's health issues and the resulting physical and emotional challenges are significant factors. The fact that she's making other efforts to show care (like oral and breakfast) shows she's trying to meet his needs in other ways. However, she's not obligated to have sex if it's causing her pain and anxiety. \n\nPushing for sex when the partner is uncomfortable could indicate a lack of empathy from the husband. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going out to get drunk isn't healthy either. The author is in a vulnerable state due to her health, which should be a time for support, not pressure.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to have sex under these circumstances. The husband's behavior is more concerning. The author is taking steps to maintain intimacy in ways she can, which is commendable. The problem might lie in the husband's unrealistic expectations and lack of consideration for her current situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
