Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who has a colostomy bag due to surgeries and is dealing with heart issues. She's not having sex with her husband because it's painful and embarrassing for her. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, and she feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has medical reasons for avoiding sex: the colostomy bag is causing her pain and embarrassment. She's also going through emotional stress from her heart issues. She's willing to offer oral sex, which her husband has preferred for years. However, she's not interested in penetrative sex because of her physical and emotional state.\n\nHer husband is pressuring her, even becoming pushy and threatening to go out and get drunk. She's trying to maintain intimacy by offering oral and making breakfast. The question is whether she's wrong for not having sex with him.\n\nI should consider consent and mutual respect in a marriage. Intimacy should be consensual and comfortable for both partners. The author has valid reasons related to her health and well-being. The husband's pressure might be inappropriate, especially if it's making her feel forced. The fact that she's willing to engage in other forms of intimacy (oral) shows she's not entirely uninterested, but her physical condition is a barrier.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction\u2014getting angry and threatening to go get drunk\u2014could indicate a problem with how he's handling the situation. Healthy relationships require communication and understanding. The author is trying to communicate her feelings and limitations, which is a responsible approach.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one initiating the pressure. She's making an effort to maintain intimacy within her limits. The husband's pushiness might be the issue here. The author's focus on other forms of affection shows she's trying to meet his needs while respecting her own boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her reasons are medical and emotional, and she's making an effort to maintain the relationship in other ways. The husband's behavior is problematic, not hers.\n"
