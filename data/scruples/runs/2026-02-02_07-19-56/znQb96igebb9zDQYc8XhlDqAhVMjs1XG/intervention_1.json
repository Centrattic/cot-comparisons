Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is pretty complex. She's been through multiple surgeries, has a colostomy bag, and is dealing with heart issues. Her husband wants sex, but she's been avoiding it because of pain, embarrassment, and stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her physical and emotional state. The colostomy bag is causing her a lot of discomfort and self-consciousness. The surgeries and heart problems add to the stress. She's also managing a household and two kids, which is draining her energy. Her husband wants physical intimacy, but she's not able to give that right now.\n\nHer husband's actions are also a factor. He's been pushy, grabbing her breasts and trying to pressure her into sex. That's not healthy. Consent and mutual respect are important here. If he's being forceful, that's a red flag. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for not complying.\n\nThe author is making efforts to show love through oral sex and breakfast. She's trying to meet his needs in other ways. However, if the physical act is causing her pain and emotional distress, it's valid that she's not able to go through with it. She's not avoiding intimacy entirely; she's just finding other ways to connect.\n\nMarriage requires compromise, but both partners need to be considerate of each other's circumstances. Her health issues are legitimate reasons for her inability to have sex. The husband's pushiness might be contributing to the problem. It's a tough spot, but she's not necessarily at fault for prioritizing her well-being and finding alternative ways to support her husband.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because her situation is valid and she's making efforts to maintain the relationship in her capacity.\n"
