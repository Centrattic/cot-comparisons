Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. \n\nFirst, the context: the woman had emergency surgery a year ago leading to a colostomy bag, multiple surgeries, and now possible heart issues. She's dealing with physical pain and emotional stress. She's tried to have sex but it's been painful and embarrassing due to the colostomy. Her husband, on the other hand, is pushing for sex, even grabbing her and getting angry when she refuses. He's been preferring oral sex for years, which she's offered. Now he's pressuring her, and she's feeling overwhelmed, doing housework and childcare, leaving her exhausted.\n\nThe key points here are the medical conditions causing her pain and emotional distress. She's not refusing sex out of spite or indifference but because of legitimate physical and emotional barriers. Her husband doesn't seem to understand her situation and is responding with pressure and anger, which is harmful. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. The husband's behavior of grabbing her and getting angry is not acceptable and could be considered coercive or even abusive. The woman is making efforts to show care through oral sex and other acts, which is her way of contributing to intimacy without engaging in vaginal sex. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the woman isn't in the wrong because she's acting under medical and emotional constraints. The husband's pushiness and lack of empathy are problematic. The author's decision to not have sex is a reasonable response given her circumstances. The question is whether she's at fault for prioritizing her own well-being and health in this situation.\n\nSo, answer B (No) makes sense here. The woman is not in the wrong; the husband's behavior is the issue.\n"
