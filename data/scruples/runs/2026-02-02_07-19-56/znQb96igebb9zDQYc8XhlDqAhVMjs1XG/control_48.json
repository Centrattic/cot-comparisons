Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation is complicated because she's dealing with a colostomy bag from surgery and recent heart issues. She's been trying to be intimate in other ways, like oral sex, which her husband prefers. But lately, he's been pushy, even grabbing her and trying to force sex when she's not up for it. She's feeling overwhelmed with housework, kids, and her health problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The husband is pressuring her into sex, which isn't okay. She's already tried other forms of intimacy but isn't comfortable with penetrative sex right now. Her reasons are valid\u2014physical pain, emotional stress, and the colostomy bag affecting her confidence. The husband's reaction of getting angry and going to get drunk isn't healthy either. \n\nThe author is making an effort by offering oral sex and doing nice things like breakfast. She's also aware of the marital problems and wants to maintain intimacy without compromising her well-being. The key points here are her health struggles, the husband's pressure, and her efforts to meet his needs in other ways. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing her physical and emotional health. It's important for both partners to communicate and find a balance. The husband might need to be more understanding and respectful of her limitations, especially during such a tough time. So the answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
