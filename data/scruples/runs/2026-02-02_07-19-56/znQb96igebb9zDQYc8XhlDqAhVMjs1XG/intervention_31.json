Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband after undergoing surgery with a colostomy bag and dealing with heart issues.\n\nFirst, the author has had multiple surgeries and a colostomy bag, which makes her feel embarrassed and the sex is painful. She's tried but it's been difficult. Her husband is pushing for sex, even grabbing her breasts, which sounds like a form of pressure or maybe even non-consensual behavior. The author is also dealing with a lot of stress from her health and taking care of two kids and housework. She's offered oral sex instead, which the husband has preferred for years, and she's trying to make breakfast and show care. But she really doesn't want sex due to physical and emotional reasons.\n\nThe key points here are the author's health issues causing pain and discomfort, the husband's pushy behavior, and the author's efforts to maintain intimacy in other ways. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking input. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider consent and mutual respect. The husband's actions of grabbing her and being pushy might be crossing boundaries. The author has reasons that are legitimate and health-related. Not wanting sex because of physical and emotional stress isn't something she's at fault for. She's making efforts in other ways, which shows she's trying to maintain the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her reasons are valid, and the husband's behavior might be the issue here. However, it's a complex situation where both might need to communicate better. But based on the scenario, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to have sex when she's experiencing pain, health issues, and stress, especially given the husband's pushy behavior.\n"
