Two more surgeries later and it's still here.  My husband (Dear Husband) has been somewhat decent about helping with household and childcare.  It's been a struggle.\n\nI'm about a month from having reversal surgery and got bad news about my heart.  Turns out I need to have an Angiogram next week, there are blockages in my arteries, and my reversal surgery might not happen like we thought.  \n\nOver this last year I have tried to have sex, not very often though.  It's been painful and is, frankly, very embarrassing for me because of the colostomy bag.  My DH says it (the bag) doesn't bother him.  Well, it bothers me a lot.  I have been very willing to   give him oral instead.  Please understand that oral is something that he has almost preferred over regular sex over the last 15 years.  \n\nLately (last month or so) he has been very pushy about having sex.  He grabs my breasts and tries to get me to have sex.  Between my not feeling up to it, because of the bag, the pain, and the emotional stress of the heart issues and testing I've been through recently I just have no interest in doing it.  \n\nLast night he tried again, said I could \"just lay there\", and then got pissed and told me he was going to go out tonight (to get drunk).  I feel bad and I know I need to have intimacy with him for our relationship's health.  I have decided to offer oral today and make him a nice breakfast to try to show that I care about him and his needs.   But I don't want sex.  Just the thought of it makes me feel like curling up in a ball and crying.  I have very low energy and have to do all the housework and care for our 2 kids, those things take my available energy and leave me sapped by the end of the day.\n\n\nAITA for not having sex with him?  Should I be doing more to make him feel loved?  I feel terrible about making him feel unwanted, and I don't want this to ruin our 15 year marriage.  Help! \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not having sex with her husband. The situation involves her health issues, including a colostomy bag and heart problems, which are causing physical and emotional stress. Her husband is pressuring her for sex, which she finds painful and embarrassing. She's trying to manage her health, household, and kids, and her energy is low.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. Her medical conditions are significant and valid reasons for physical discomfort and lack of desire. The husband's insistence, especially after surgeries and health issues, might be seen as insensitive. The author is making efforts to show affection through oral sex and breakfast, which shows she's trying to maintain intimacy in her own way.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014getting angry and going out to get drunk\u2014seems aggressive and dismissive of her feelings. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding, especially during times of health challenges. The author's refusal to have sex isn't about rejection but about her physical and emotional state.\n\nShe's also balancing a lot: surgeries, childcare, housework, and medical appointments. It's reasonable that prioritizing her well-being and recovery would affect her sexual desire. The fact that she's making other efforts to connect (oral sex, breakfast) suggests she's not unwilling to engage in intimacy but has set boundaries based on her comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue the husband's needs are valid. But given the context, his pushiness seems out of place. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the circumstances, her decision to avoid sex is understandable. She's not neglecting the relationship; she's managing her health and trying to meet his needs in other ways. The husband's response is more concerning here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author's health issues and the husband's behavior are key factors. She's making efforts within her limits, while the husband's actions are problematic.\n"
