Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The situation involves a 17-month-old who's often in a diaper in photos. The grandmother is adding stickers over the daughter's nipples on Facebook, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author told their mom to stop posting the photos, and now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around children's privacy. In many places, posting children's photos without consent isn't inherently illegal, but there are laws about distributing images that could be considered inappropriate. However, the main issue here is the mother's action of adding stickers over the nipples. The author is upset because this seems to sexualize the child when other children's similar photos are unedited.\n\nThe grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. That's a subjective view. The author's stance is about protecting their daughter from being sexualized. The question is whether the author overstepped by telling the grandmother to stop posting any pictures of their daughter. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, parents have the right to control how their children are represented in public. The author is asserting that right, so they're not in the wrong. The grandmother might have her own views, but the author's priority is their child's well-being. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
