Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom whose daughter is 17 months old. The daughter often wears just a diaper, so the photos are of her in that. The mother's mom (the author's mom) is posting these photos on Facebook but covering the baby's nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing the child, especially since her nephew's similar photos aren't censored. The mother insists the stickers are necessary because the photos are inappropriate without them, and the author told her not to post anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. First, the baby's nudity in photos. In many places, it's legal to take photos of children in the nude, as long as it's for non-exploitative purposes. Family photos, especially of toddlers who don't have a concept of modesty, are common. However, when it comes to sharing those photos online, there can be privacy concerns.\n\nThe author's mother is adding stickers to the nipples. The author thinks this is sexualizing the child. The mother thinks the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author is upset about the censorship. The key here is understanding both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's viewpoint, the stickers might be seen as unnecessary and perhaps even implying that there's something wrong with the child's natural appearance. Since the author's nephew's photos are not censored, it's a double standard. The author's main issue is that the stickers are making the photos seem more sexualized than they are. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mother might be trying to protect the photos from being considered explicit on social media. Some platforms have strict policies about nudity, even of children. By adding the stickers, she might be trying to comply with those policies, but the method is causing distress to the author.\n\nNow, the author told her mother not to post any more pictures. That could be seen as aggressive, but maybe it's because of the conflict over the stickers. The author's position is that the censorship is inappropriate. The mother's position is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is the parent of the child, so they have the right to make decisions about their child's privacy and how photos are shared. The mother is the grandmother, but she's posting the photos without the consent of the parent. Even if her intention is to comply with social media guidelines, the parent's objection is valid. The author's right to control the sharing of their child's images is important. \n\nThe grandmother's action of adding stickers could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's altering the photos in a way the parent didn't agree to. The parent's decision to stop the grandmother from posting is their right as the parent. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe the grandmother is allowed to post family photos. However, the parent is the legal guardian, so the parent has the authority to limit such sharing. The use of stickers might be a way to make the photos more acceptable for her friends, but the parent's discomfort is justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The parent's authority and concern for their child's privacy and appropriate representation take precedence here.\n"
