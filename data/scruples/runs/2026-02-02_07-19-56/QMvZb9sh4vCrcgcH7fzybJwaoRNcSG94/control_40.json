To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest with stickers in photos posted on Facebook to make them appropriate for her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is not sexualized. The mother is using heart or smiley face stickers to cover the nipples. The author finds this creepy and believes it's sexualizing the child. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. However, the author's nephew's uncensored photos are also on Facebook, which adds another layer because there's no similar issue with him.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's acceptable to take photos of children in certain contexts, and covering their genitalia isn't necessary unless the photos are explicit. However, societal norms also play a role here. There's a double standard often applied to female children's bodies versus male children's, especially when it comes to modesty and censorship in photos. The mother's actions might stem from a desire to protect her audience from seeing the child's genitalia, but the way she's doing it with stickers could be perceived as drawing unnecessary attention to the area, which could indeed be seen as sexualizing the child.\n\nThe author's stance is that their daughter's nipples are the same as their nephew's, and since the nephew's photos aren't censored, there's inconsistency. The mother's defense is about appropriateness for her friends, but the author is pushing back against what they see as inappropriate censorship that adds a sexualized element. \n\nFrom a parental rights perspective, the author has the right to control how their child is presented in photos. The mother's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, conflict with the author's parenting choices. When the author asked the mother to stop, the mother's continued actions might be overstepping, especially if the author is the primary guardian. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries about how their child is photographed and shared. The mother's actions, while perhaps stemming from a desire to keep content family-friendly, are conflicting with the author's wishes and potentially applying gendered censorship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
