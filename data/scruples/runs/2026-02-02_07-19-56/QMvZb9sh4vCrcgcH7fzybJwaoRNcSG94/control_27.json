Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The mom (the author's mother) is posting pictures of the child in a diaper and adding stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualized, especially since their nephew's similar photos aren't censored. They told their mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is about the mother's actions. Covering a child's genitalia or nipples in photos isn't standard unless there's a specific reason. The author's mother is adding stickers, which might be an attempt to make the photos more appropriate for her audience. But the author feels this is unnecessary and objectifying. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's allowed to photograph minors in certain states of undress, especially if they're toddlers. However, the act of modifying photos with stickers could be a way to make the content more \"acceptable\" to others. The author's concern is that their daughter's nipples are the same as their nephew's, implying that the same treatment isn't given to a boy, which might point to gender bias. \n\nThe author's mother might be trying to protect the photos from public scrutiny, but the author feels this is overstepping. The author's response was to tell the mother to stop posting the pictures. The key here is parental rights and the mother's right to post photos of her grandchild. However, the author is the parent, so they might have the final say in how their child is represented.\n\nEthically, the author has a right to be concerned about how their child is portrayed. Sexualizing a child, even unintentionally, is a serious issue. The mother's use of stickers could be seen as drawing attention to the child's body in a way that's not appropriate. The fact that the nephew isn't censored might indicate a double standard, which supports the author's position.\n\nThe author isn't wrong in standing up for their child's privacy and comfort. They're also within their rights to set boundaries about how their daughter's images are shared. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, might not align with the author's values regarding their child's dignity and privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
