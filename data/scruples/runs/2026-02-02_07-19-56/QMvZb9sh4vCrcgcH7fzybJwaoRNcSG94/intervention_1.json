Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's mother editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother argues that the photos without the stickers are inappropriate for her friends. The author then tells their mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so her body, including her nipples, are naturally uncensored. The mother is covering them with stickers, possibly to make the photos more acceptable for social media. The author feels that this is inappropriate, as it's sexualizing the child, and they're trying to stop the posts.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, it's illegal to distribute explicit images of minors. However, in this case, the photos are of a diaper-clad toddler, so the exposure is natural and not sexual in intent. The mother's action of adding stickers could be seen as unnecessary censorship, but perhaps she's doing it out of concern for others' reactions or societal norms. However, the author might be right in thinking that covering a child's natural body parts is inappropriate, especially since male infants and toddlers aren't typically censored in the same way.\n\nEthically, the mother's action might be based on her own discomfort or the idea that others might find the photos inappropriate. But the author's stance is about protecting their daughter from being sexualized. Since the child is a minor, the author has a right to make decisions regarding their child's portrayal. The mother's editing could be seen as overstepping, especially if done without consent and for the mother's own social media comfort.\n\nAnother angle is the author's response: telling their mother not to post any more pictures. This could be seen as a reasonable action to protect the child's privacy and avoid potential harm from unnecessary alterations. The author isn't objecting to the photos themselves but the specific editing. So, they're within their rights to request that the mother stops posting the edited photos, especially if they believe it's in the child's best interest.\n\nHowever, the author's demand to stop all posts might be taken as extreme. Maybe a compromise, like allowing unedited photos but not edited ones, would be better. But the mother's initial action of adding stickers is questionable. The author's concern about sexualization is valid because adding stickers to cover a child's body parts can be seen as drawing unnecessary attention to those areas, which could be inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother might be acting out of a desire to protect the child's image, but the method is problematic. The author is asserting their parental authority to decide how their child is represented online. Since the author is the parent, they have the right to make such decisions, especially regarding their child's portrayal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother's actions are problematic, and the author is rightly objecting to the sexualization. The author's response is a reasonable attempt to stop the inappropriate editing. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
