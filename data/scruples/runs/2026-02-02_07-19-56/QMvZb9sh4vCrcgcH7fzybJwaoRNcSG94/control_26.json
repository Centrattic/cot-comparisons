Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The author's daughter is 17 months old, and the mother-in-law is posting pictures of her in a diaper, covering the nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around photographing children. In many places, it's legal to take and share photos of young children, especially in private settings. However, the use of stickers to cover nipples might be a point of contention. The mother's argument is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, implying she's trying to avoid any possible misinterpretation.\n\nThe author is concerned that the act of covering the nipples with stickers is sexualizing the child. This is a valid concern because drawing attention to a child's body parts can be seen as inappropriate, especially in public forums like Facebook. The fact that the nephew's photos aren't censored might highlight a gender bias here, which adds to the author's discomfort.\n\nNext, the author's response was to tell their mother not to post any more pictures. That's a reasonable boundary to set, especially when they feel their child is being misrepresented or potentially sexualized. The mother, on the other hand, might feel that she's protecting the photos' appropriateness for her audience. But the key here is the intent and the effect. The author's main issue is with the stickers making the photos creepy and sexualizing their daughter, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem justified. They are protecting their child's image and setting boundaries for how their family is represented online. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, may be crossing into inappropriate territory. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their preferences here.\n"
