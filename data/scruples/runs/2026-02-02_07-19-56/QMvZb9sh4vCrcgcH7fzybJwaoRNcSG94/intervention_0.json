Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom whose mother is posting photos of her 17-month-old daughter in a diaper on Facebook, but adding stickers over the baby's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, while the grandmother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author then tells her mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so very young. The photos are of her in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. The grandmother is editing the photos by adding stickers over the nipples. The author is uncomfortable with this and finds it sexualizing, especially since boys' photos are posted without such edits. The grandmother, on the other hand, thinks the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author then asks if they're in the wrong for stopping their mother from posting.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, it's illegal to publish images of children that are considered indecent. However, a diaper is considered appropriate clothing for a toddler. Adding stickers to cover nipples might imply that the child's body is inappropriate, which could be a way to make the photos more acceptable for social media. But the author's concern is about the sexualization. Covering a child's nipples with stickers might be seen as unnecessary or even as drawing attention to the body part, which could be problematic. \n\nThe grandmother's reasoning is that without the stickers, the photos are inappropriate. But if the child is in a diaper, the photos are of a child in normal daily wear, so the grandmother's argument might be overreaching. The author is acting to protect their child's image from being altered in a way that they believe is inappropriate.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, the author has the right to decide how their child's images are used. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is the parent. The stickers might be adding an element that the parent finds inappropriate. The author's response to stop the grandmother from posting is in line with protecting their child's image.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to object to how their child's images are edited and posted. The grandmother's actions might stem from her own discomfort or societal norms, but the parent's decision should take precedence.\n"
