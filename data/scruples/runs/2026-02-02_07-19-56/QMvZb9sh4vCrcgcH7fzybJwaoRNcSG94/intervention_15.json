Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mother whose daughter is 17 months old and often photographed in a diaper. The grandmother is posting these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples. The author feels this is creepy and sexualizing, especially since her nephew's photos aren't censored. The mother told her not to post any more pictures of her daughter after discussing it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so the photos in a diaper are likely of her bare chest. The grandmother is covering the nipples with stickers, which the author finds inappropriate. The author argues that the same isn't done for the nephew, implying a double standard. The mother of the author (the grandmother) claims the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, so the author asked her to stop posting.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is asserting control over how her daughter's images are shared. The grandmother's actions might be based on her own beliefs about appropriateness. However, the author is the parent, so the primary authority over the child's portrayal should lie with them. The grandmother might have good intentions, thinking the photos are too revealing, but she's not the parent. \n\nBut the author's response was to tell her mother to stop posting any pictures. That seems a bit harsh. Maybe the author could have suggested covering the nipples without banning all photos. However, the grandmother was already altering the photos in a way the author found problematic. The author's stance is that the child's nipples aren't different from the nephew's, which are uncensored. So there's a gender-based issue here. The grandmother might be applying different standards based on the child's gender, which is a concern. The author is pushing back against that, which is valid. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for saying no? The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, perhaps even contributing to the sexualization by drawing attention to the body parts. The author has the right to decide how her child's images are shared. So the author's action of stopping the grandmother from posting might be justified, especially if the grandmother isn't the parent. \n\nHowever, the way the author handled it could be improved. Instead of an outright ban, maybe a more collaborative approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the potential for the grandmother's actions to be problematic, especially the gender disparity, the author is probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
