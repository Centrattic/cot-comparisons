To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a mother (the author) who doesn't want her mom to cover her daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old and often wears only a diaper. The grandmother is posting photos on Facebook with stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, while the author thinks the stickers are unnecessary and that the nephew's photos are uncensored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The main issue is about the appropriateness of covering a child's nipples in photos. In many cultures and on social media, there's a norm to cover children's genitalia or nipples in public photos, often to avoid any potential for misinterpretation or discomfort. However, the author is objecting to the addition of stickers, arguing that it's unnecessary and inappropriate, especially when the nephew's photos are shared without such edits.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, exposing a child in photos, even a toddler, can be a concern. Parents often have to balance between natural behavior (like letting a toddler run around in a diaper at home) and the perception of those images in public spaces. The grandmother's action of covering the nipples might be her way of aligning with what she deems appropriate for her audience. But the author is upset because she sees this as adding something that sexualizes the child, which is a valid concern. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mom not to post any more pictures of her daughter, given the disagreement.\n\nThe author's stance is that the stickers are creepy and that the photos without them are not inappropriate, especially when compared to the nephew's photos. The grandmother's actions might be based on her own comfort or the norms she follows. The author is asserting her parental authority to control how her child is presented publicly. However, by demanding that her mom stop posting all pictures, the author might be overreacting, especially if the grandmother's intention was to make the photos more appropriate as per her standards.\n\nBut the core issue is whether covering the child's nipples is necessary. In some contexts, even a diaper might be considered not sufficient, and covering the chest adds an extra layer. The author might not want her child to be associated with any form of censorship that could be seen as implying the child's body is inappropriate. On the other hand, the grandmother's action could be protective of her own social standing or to avoid any potential issues with others viewing the photos.\n\nThe author is in a position where she's asking her mother not to post any more pictures. This is a strong reaction. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are causing conflict. The author's right to decide how her child is portrayed is significant, but so is the grandmother's autonomy in sharing family photos. However, the author is the parent, so her boundaries should be respected. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for opposing the stickers. \n\nIf the original photos (with the child in a diaper) are acceptable without the stickers, then adding the stickers could be seen as unnecessary and possibly problematic. However, if the grandmother's friends find the photos inappropriate without the stickers, there's a social norm to consider. The author's discomfort with the stickers is valid, and her request to stop posting might be a reasonable way to resolve the conflict, given that she's the parent. \n\nSo, putting this together: the author is not in the wrong. The stickers are adding an element that the author finds inappropriate, and as a parent, she has the right to set boundaries about her child's image. The grandmother's reasoning is based on her perception of appropriateness, but the author's objection is about the method used to achieve that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
