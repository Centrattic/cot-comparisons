Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The mom takes photos of her in a diaper and edits them with stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos aren't censored. They told their mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to distribute photos of minors that are considered sexually explicit. But a diaper-clad toddler's body might not be considered explicit. However, the mother's editing with stickers could be an overreaction. The author is concerned that adding stickers might be highlighting the nipples, making it seem sexual. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. People have different views on this. Some might think the mother is being protective, others that she's unnecessarily drawing attention. The key point is that the author is objecting because they feel the photos are being sexualized. The mother's reasoning is that her friends might find the photos inappropriate without the stickers. But if the daughter's body is natural and similar to other children's, then the censorship could be unwarranted. \n\nThe author's action of telling the mother to stop posting the pictures is within their rights as a parent. They have the authority to decide what's appropriate for their child's image. The mother may have good intentions, but the author is the one responsible for the child's well-being and privacy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their child's privacy and objecting to what they see as unnecessary sexualization. The mother's actions could be based on her own discomfort or societal norms, but the author has the right to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
