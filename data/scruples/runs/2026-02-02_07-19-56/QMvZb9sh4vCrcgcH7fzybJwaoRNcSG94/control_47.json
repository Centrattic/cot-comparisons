Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler, and the family allows her to be in diapers at home. The mom posts pictures on Facebook, but adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, unlike when she covers their nephew's photos. The mom says the pics are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author told her to stop posting, and now the user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is an infant, so the photos are of a very young child. The mother is editing the photos to cover nipples, which the author sees as unnecessary and possibly adding a sexualized element. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, implying they're for adult audiences. The author is opposing this, so the question is about whether their stance is justified.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, laws regarding child nudity vary, but in many places, photos of young children without clothing are generally allowed, especially if it's a private setting. However, the context matters. If the photos are intended for public sharing, especially on social media, there might be more scrutiny. The mother's action of adding stickers could be an overreaction, but she's trying to make the photos acceptable for her audience. The author is concerned that adding stickers is sexualizing the child, which is a valid concern because even covering a child's nipples in a playful way might be seen as objectifying them.\n\nEthically, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure and how photos are shared. They are the parent, so they have the authority to decide what's appropriate for their child. The mother's insistence on covering the nipples might be based on her own discomfort or societal norms, but the author's decision to stop the posts altogether is a way to protect their child's privacy and prevent any potential for misinterpretation.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is the parent, so their decision overrides the grandmother's. The mother's friends seeing the photos as inappropriate might be a red flag about her social circle, but that's not the author's issue to fix. The main point is the author's right to control their child's image and protect them from any form of sexualization, even if the mother thinks it's harmless.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their child's interests and asserting their parental rights. The mother's actions might stem from her own views, but the author's decision to stop the posts is justified. So the answer is B.\n"
