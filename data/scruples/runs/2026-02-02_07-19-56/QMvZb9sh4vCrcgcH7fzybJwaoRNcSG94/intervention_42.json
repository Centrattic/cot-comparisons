Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The situation involves a 17-month-old who's often in a diaper, and the grandmother is posting pictures with stickers over the nipples. The author finds it creepy and sexualizing, but the mom says the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the details.\n\nFirst, the age of the child is important. At 17 months, the child is a toddler, and there's no concept of modesty or sexuality. The author's main concern is that covering the nipples with stickers might be sexualizing the child, especially when male relatives' uncensored photos are also online. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, implying that she's trying to protect her audience from seeing exposed nipples.\n\nIn many cultures, there's a double standard regarding nudity in children. Female nudity is often more scrutinized than male, which might be part of the issue here. The grandmother's action of covering the female child's nipples but not the male's could be seen as contributing to that double standard. However, the grandmother might also be following social norms about appropriate content on social media, where even children's photos might be edited to avoid any potential controversy.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting their daughter from being sexualized. It's a valid concern because when a child is presented with covered genitalia or nipples but no other parts, it could be seen as emphasizing those areas unnecessarily. On the other hand, the author's response was to tell the grandmother to stop posting pictures entirely, which might be an overreaction. Instead of a complete ban, perhaps discussing the issue more and finding a compromise, like not using stickers or adjusting what is posted, could have been better.\n\nThe key points are consent and the intent behind the action. The grandmother is posting photos without the child's consent, and the author has the right to object to how their child is portrayed. However, the author's solution of stopping all posts might be too harsh, especially if the grandmother's intention was to share family moments. The author could have asked for the stickers to be removed instead of halting posts entirely. This might have been a more effective way to address the issue without cutting off communication about the child's life.\n\nAnother angle is the grandmother's social media environment. If her friends are in a professional or mixed-age setting, she might feel the need to censor the photos. However, 17-month-olds typically don't have exposed genitalia in photos that are considered inappropriate in the same way adults do. The use of stickers might be an overcorrection, adding unnecessary attention to the child's body.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their daughter from potential sexualization. However, their approach of stopping all posts might not be the best solution. The grandmother's actions, while well-intentioned, could perpetuate harmful norms. The correct answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
