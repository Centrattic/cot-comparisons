Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so under two years old. The mom takes pictures of her in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. The grandmother then edits these photos by adding stickers over the nipples and posts them on Facebook. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's photos are uncensored. The mother justifies it by saying the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then tells her not to post any more pictures of their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 17 months, the child is an infant, so the photos are of a very young girl. The mother is concerned about her own daughter's images being altered and shared in a way that feels inappropriate. The grandmother is adding stickers to cover nipples, which could be seen as unnecessary or implying something sexual when there's no intent. The author is standing up for their child's privacy and how they're portrayed online.\n\nIn terms of legality, in many places, sharing photos of minors can be a gray area, but if the photos are of a child in a state of undress, even if it's just a diaper, some might argue it's not appropriate to alter them in a way that draws attention to certain areas. However, the grandmother's action of adding stickers might be her way of making the content more acceptable for her audience. But the author is uncomfortable with the implication that their child needs to be censored in this way, especially when her nephew's photos aren't altered.\n\nThe key points here are the child's age, the intent behind the edits, and the parent's right to control how their child is portrayed. Generally, parents have the authority to make decisions about their children's privacy and how their images are shared. The grandmother might be overstepping by altering the photos and then being defensive when the parent objects. The author is asserting their boundaries, which is a reasonable response. The grandmother's justification about her friends' appropriateness might not hold weight if the parent is against it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
