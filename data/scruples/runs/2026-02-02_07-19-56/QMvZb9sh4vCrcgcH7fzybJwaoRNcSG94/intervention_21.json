Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mom argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author says that's not the case because their nephew's similar photos aren't censored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 17-month-old is a toddler, and in many places, it's considered normal for children this age to be naked at home. The author isn't objecting to the photos themselves but to the mom's editing. The mom's reasoning is about appropriateness for Facebook friends, implying she thinks the nipples are too revealing. However, the author feels that covering them adds unnecessary attention, making it seem sexualized. \n\nNow, the key points here are the parent's rights versus the grandmother's actions. The author is the parent, so they have the authority to make decisions about their child's privacy and how photos are shared. The mom's justification is about her friends seeing the photos, but the parent's main concern is about how the photos are altered. \n\nI think there are two angles here. On one hand, the grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's adding elements that the parent disagrees with. On the other hand, the parent is asking her not to post any pictures, which might be a bit extreme if the issue is only about the stickers. But considering that the parent is the one making the final decisions for their child, they have the right to set boundaries. The mom's editing might inadvertently sexualize the child, which the parent is rightly concerned about. \n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for telling the grandmother not to post any more photos. The parent's stance is based on protecting their child from potential sexualization, which is a valid concern. The grandmother's actions, even if well-intentioned, might be causing unintended harm. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
