Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 17 months old, so an infant. The mom lets her run around in a diaper at home, and they take pictures of her like that. The grandmother posts these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing, especially since their nephew's photos are posted without such edits. The grandmother says the photos are inappropriate for her friends otherwise, so the author told her not to post more pictures.\n\nSo the key points here: the author is concerned about the stickers being a form of sexualization. The grandmother is trying to cover the nipples, but the author thinks that's making it more sexual. The grandmother's friends might be uncomfortable with the uncensored photos. The author is now blocking the grandmother from posting more photos.\n\nI need to consider the norms around posting photos of children, especially regarding modesty and privacy. For infants, it's common to have them in diapers, and some parents might choose not to show their children's genitals in public photos. However, in this case, the grandmother is editing the photos to cover the nipples, which might be seen as unnecessary or even highlighting them, which could be the author's concern. \n\nThe author's stance is that there's no difference between their daughter and their nephew, who isn't censored. The grandmother's action could be based on her own discomfort or the social norms of her friends. But the author is objecting because they find the stickers inappropriate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are protecting their child's privacy and objecting to what they see as sexualization. On the other hand, the grandmother might be trying to follow her own standards or her friends' expectations. However, the author has the right to make decisions about their child's portrayal in photos. Since the grandmother is the one posting the photos, the author is within their rights to ask her not to post them if they're uncomfortable. The issue is whether the author's request is justified. Since the author's concern is about the potential sexualization and the grandmother's action might inadvertently highlight the nipples by covering them, the author's position seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
