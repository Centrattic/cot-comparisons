Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is upset that their mother is covering their 17-month-old daughter's nipples in photos with stickers, which they find creepy and sexualizing. The mother argues that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, it's legal to take and share photos of children in the bathtub or diaper, especially in private settings, as long as there's no explicit sexual content. However, adding stickers over the nipples might be the mother's way of making the photos more \"acceptable\" for social media, but the author finds that offensive.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, the author might feel that their mother is overstepping by sexualizing their child, even if unintentionally. The author's stance is about protecting their daughter's image and autonomy. On the other hand, the mother's intention might be to shield her own friends from seeing what she considers inappropriate content, which could be based on her own values or societal norms.\n\nThe author's response was to tell their mother not to post any more pictures. That seems like a strong reaction. Maybe the author could have discussed setting boundaries instead of a complete ban. However, the mother's actions might have crossed a line if the author feels their child is being unnecessarily sexualized. The key here is consent and the parent's responsibility to protect their child's dignity.\n\nI think the mother's action of covering the nipples with stickers could be seen as adding a sexual element where there isn't one. The author is within their rights to object to that. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary, especially since the child is underage and can't consent to having her image altered in that way. So the answer should be B.\n"
