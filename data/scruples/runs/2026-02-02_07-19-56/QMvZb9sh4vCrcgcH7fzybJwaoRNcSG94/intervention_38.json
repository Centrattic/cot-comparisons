Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, and the mom takes pictures of her in a diaper. The grandmother is adding stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The grandmother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author told her not to post more pictures.\n\nFirst, the key points are about the appropriateness of the photos and the mother's actions. The author is concerned that covering the child's nipples with stickers is sexualizing her, which is a valid concern since children's bodies should be portrayed respectfully without any sexual connotations. The grandmother's defense is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, implying that the unedited photos are not suitable for her friends. However, the author is asserting their right to control their child's privacy and how she's represented online.\n\nThe legal aspect: In many places, laws about child pornography are strict. Even if the photos are of a child's private parts, they can be considered non-consensual and potentially illegal if shared publicly without consent. So the grandmother's actions might be risky. But the author is now objecting, which could be seen as reasonable because they're protecting their child's privacy and preventing potential legal issues.\n\nThe dynamics between the author and the grandmother: The author has a right to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure online. The grandmother might not realize the implications of her actions, but once the author has addressed it, the grandmother should respect that boundary. The author's request to stop posting the photos is a reasonable response to protect their child's well-being.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for their child's privacy and against the potential sexualization. The grandmother's actions, even if well-intentioned, cross into inappropriate territory. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
