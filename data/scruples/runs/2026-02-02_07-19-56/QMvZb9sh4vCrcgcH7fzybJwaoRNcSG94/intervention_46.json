Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's mom covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos aren't censored. The mom argues the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the age of the child. 17 months is very young. In many places, there are laws about photographing and distributing images of minors in certain ways. The author is concerned that the mom is adding stickers over the nipples, which they see as unnecessary and possibly inappropriately sexualizing. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, but the author is telling her to stop posting altogether.\n\nWait, the key points here: the mother is editing the photos with stickers to cover the child's nipples. The author thinks this is unnecessary and creepy. The mom's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author then tells the mom not to post any more pictures. \n\nI need to think about the ethics here. The author is the parent, so they have the authority over their child's image. The mother is the grandparent, sharing photos she has taken. The author is objecting to the editing and the posting. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for telling their mom to stop posting? Well, the author is the parent, so they have the right to control how their child is represented. However, maybe the mom has a right to share family photos, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the mom's action of adding stickers is appropriate. If the author finds it sexualizing, and the mom justifies it by saying the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, there's a conflict in perspectives. The author's stance is that the photos are fine as they are, especially since the child is in a diaper, which is typical for toddlers. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in some places, even nude photos of children can be considered inappropriate or illegal if shared publicly, but the age and context matter. A 17-month-old in a diaper might be considered different than an older child. However, the stickers might be seen as emphasizing the body parts, which could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe author's response is to tell the mom to stop posting any pictures. That might be an overreaction, especially if the mom was just trying to share family moments. However, the author is the parent and has the right to decide what's appropriate for their child's image. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is standing up for their child's privacy and feels the mom's edits are inappropriate, then they might be justified. On the other hand, if the mom is within her rights to share family photos, even edited ones, the author's demand might be too strict. \n\nBut considering the age of the child and the fact that the mom is adding stickers, which the author finds problematic, the author's position seems valid. The author is protecting their child from potential sexualization. The mom's argument that it's for her friends' sake might not be sufficient if the author is uncomfortable. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is not in the wrong. They are setting boundaries to protect their child's image and privacy.\n"
