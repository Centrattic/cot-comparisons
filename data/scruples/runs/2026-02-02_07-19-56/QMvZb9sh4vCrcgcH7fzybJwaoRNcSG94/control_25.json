Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The mom is posting photos of the daughter in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. The grandmother is adding stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, so the author told her not to post more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, laws regarding child nudity online can be strict. Even if the photos are of a young child, some jurisdictions might consider any nudity inappropriate for public sharing, especially on social media. However, the grandmother is altering the photos by adding stickers, which might be a way to comply with those laws. But the author's issue is with the act of adding stickers, implying that the grandmother is focusing on the nipples, which could be seen as unnecessary or inappropriate.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author feels that the stickers are sexualizing their daughter. Since the daughter is a toddler, her body is not sexualized, so covering the nipples might be an adult's projection. The grandmother might be doing this out of concern for her friends' comfort or following social norms, but the author believes it draws unnecessary attention to the body part, making it seem more sexual than it is.\n\nCommunication between the author and mother is key. The author addressed it but might not have fully explained why the stickers are an issue. The mother's response was to say the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, which suggests she might be under the impression that the photos are otherwise inappropriate. The author's solution was to stop posting altogether, which could be seen as a justified boundary to protect their child's privacy and prevent any potential issues with the images being altered in a way they find uncomfortable.\n\nAnother point is the comparison to the nephew's photos. The author mentions the nephew's photos are uncensored, implying that the same standard isn't being applied to boys. This could highlight a double standard, which the author might find problematic. The grandmother's action might be influenced by gender stereotypes, which the author is rightly challenging.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the parent and has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's image. The grandmother's actions, while well-intentioned, are being done without the parent's full consent and might be overstepping. The author's decision to stop all posts is a way to prevent any further alterations and to maintain control over their child's image in public spaces.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say that the grandmother is just trying to be respectful or follow social media guidelines. However, the parent's authority in these matters is paramount. Also, the fact that the child is a toddler and the photos are in a diaper might be legally permissible in some places, but the stickers add an element that the parent finds unsettling. The key here is the parent's right to make decisions regarding their child's representation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They are setting appropriate boundaries to protect their child's privacy and to prevent any sexualization. The grandmother's actions, while perhaps meant to be protective, are causing discomfort and the parent is within their rights to address this.\n"
