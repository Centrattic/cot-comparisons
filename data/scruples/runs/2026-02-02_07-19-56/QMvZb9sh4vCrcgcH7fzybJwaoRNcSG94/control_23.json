Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The situation involves a 17-month-old who's often in a diaper, so the photos are of her with just her diaper on. The mother-in-law adds stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. They compared it to their nephew's uncensored photos, which are also on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child safety and privacy. Kids in diapers at home are common, but posting photos online can be a privacy issue. The author's mom is editing the photos with stickers, which the author sees as unnecessary and possibly inappropriate. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. But the author argues that the nipples aren't different from their nephew's, implying that the censorship is unnecessary here.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the appropriateness of sharing a child's photos. The author is standing up for their child's privacy, which is a parent's right. The mother-in-law's actions might be influenced by societal norms or her own discomfort, but the parent has the final say in what they're comfortable with regarding their child's exposure online. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries with family. They're protecting their child's future from potential embarrassment or exploitation. The mother-in-law might be overstepping by editing the photos without consent. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
