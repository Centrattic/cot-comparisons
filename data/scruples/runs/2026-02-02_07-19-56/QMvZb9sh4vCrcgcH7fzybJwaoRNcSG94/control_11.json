Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The mom argues that the photos without stickers are inappropriate for her friends, so she adds those stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and feels it's sexualizing the child, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 17-month-old in a diaper is likely not aware of modesty or sexualization. However, the mother's action involves editing photos to cover her daughter's body in a way that's not done for a male relative. That could imply a double standard, which might contribute to the author's discomfort.\n\nNext, the mother's reasoning: she says the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. But given the child's age and the context (home, diaper), it's common for young children to be photographed without clothing. The stickers themselves, with heart or smiley faces, might be intended to make the photos more acceptable, but they could indeed be seen as adding unnecessary attention to the body parts, which the author finds problematic.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting their child from being sexualized. They've clearly communicated their discomfort to the mother, and the mother continued the behavior. The author then told the mother to stop posting the photos. The key here is whether the author overstepped by asking the mother to stop altogether, or if they're justified in their request.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to photograph their children, but they also have a responsibility to act in the child's best interest. The mother's editing might be an attempt to shield her Facebook friends from seeing the child without clothes, which could be seen as a protective measure, but the method might be inappropriate. The author's objection is about how the photos are edited, not the fact that they're posted. However, the mother's response was to continue and even add the stickers, which the author finds creepy.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is advocating for their child's privacy and dignity. The mother's actions could be seen as perpetuating a sexualized view, even if unintentionally. The author's request to stop posting might be a way to prevent that. The mother, on the other hand, might feel that she's managing her own social media presence as she sees fit.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the mother's actions are indeed harmful or inappropriate. Since the author believes the stickers are sexualizing the child and the mother isn't applying the same to the nephew, the author's stance seems reasonable. The mother's justification about appropriateness for friends might not hold weight if the editing is causing harm to the child's image or development.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around how their child is photographed and posted online. They have the right to protect their child from what they perceive as inappropriate editing. So the correct answer would be B (No).\n"
