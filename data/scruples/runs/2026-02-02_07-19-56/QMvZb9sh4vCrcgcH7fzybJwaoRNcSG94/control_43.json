Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a mother (the author) whose daughter is 17 months old. They take pictures of her in diapers at home. The author's mom posts these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the baby's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since a nephew's photos aren't censored. He told his mom to stop posting the pictures. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is a minor, so the parents have the primary authority over decisions regarding their child's privacy and how the child is presented. The mother is the legal guardian, so her consent is key. The issue here is the grandmother adding stickers to cover the nipples when posting the photos. The author is upset about this because he thinks it's unnecessary and possibly sexualizing the child, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew.\n\nI should think about child safety and privacy laws. In many places, it's advised not to post explicit images of children online, but in this case, the baby is in a diaper, so the concern might be about the nipples being visible. The mother might be trying to protect the child's privacy, but the author perceives the stickers as adding unnecessary attention to the body parts, which could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe author told his mom to stop posting pictures altogether, which could be seen as overreacting if the mom's intention was just to moderate content. But the author's concern is about the sexualization, which is a valid point. If the stickers are adding a sexual element, that's problematic. The mother might not realize that her action could be interpreted that way. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to tell his mom not to post any more pictures. That could be seen as dismissing his mom's intent to share family moments, but if he's uncomfortable with the edited photos, he has the right to set boundaries. The key here is the author's right to decide how his daughter's images are shared. Since he's the parent, his consent is necessary. If the mom is posting without his permission, even if editing, he can object. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. His concern about the sexualization is valid, and he's within his rights to ask his mom to stop posting the photos if he disagrees with the edits. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
