Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with heart and smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, while the mother argues that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is neutral, like a boy's, in terms of nipples. The mother is editing the photos, which the author objects to because it adds unnecessary elements that could be seen as sexualized. The mother's reasoning is about appropriateness for her Facebook friends, but the author is concerned about the sexualization aspect.\n\nLegally, in many places, showing children's bodies in photos isn't illegal, but altering photos to add stickers might be a different matter. However, the main ethical issue here is about the mother's intent. By covering the nipples with cute stickers, the mother might be unintentionally drawing attention to the body part, which could be seen as inappropriate. The author is protecting their daughter from being sexualized, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe mother's friends might have different standards, but the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure. The mother might be overstepping by editing the photos without consulting the author, especially if the original photos are of a toddler in a diaper, which is normal for that age. The stickers could be making the photos more about the adult's perception of appropriateness rather than the child's natural state.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The author is the parent, so they have the final say in how their child's images are shared. The mother's edits could be seen as a way to make the photos \"acceptable\" for her audience, but that doesn't negate the author's right to object. The author's stance is about protecting their daughter's dignity and avoiding any sexualization, which is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the author is not being unreasonable. The mother's actions are the ones that are questionable here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
