Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-month-old girl's photos on Facebook where the grandmother is covering the child's nipples with stickers.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a toddler, so her body is naturally unclothed in the photos. The mother is okay with the photos being taken at home but objects to the grandmother editing them with stickers to cover the nipples. The mother argues that this makes the photos sexualized and creepy, especially since male relatives aren't censored. The grandmother says the photos are inappropriate for her Facebook friends without the stickers.\n\nI need to consider the legal and social norms here. In the US, there's a lot of debate about the censorship of children's bodies. Many argue that it's unnecessary and can imply that the child's body is something to be hidden, leading to body image issues later. On the flip side, the grandmother might be trying to avoid any potential criticism or legal issues if someone objects to the photos. But in reality, photos of minors in natural settings without sexual context are generally protected under free speech, though platforms might have their own policies.\n\nThe mother's stance is about protecting her child's natural image and avoiding sexualization. The grandmother's action might stem from her own discomfort or societal pressure to censor children's bodies. However, by adding stickers, she might be inadvertently highlighting the area, which could be seen as drawing attention to it in a way that's not necessary. \n\nThe mother told the grandmother not to post any more pictures. That's a strict response, but the grandmother's actions are the initial problem. The key issue is whether the mother overstepped by banning all photos or if the grandmother's censorship is unwarranted. Since the daughter's body isn't inherently sexualized in the context of being a toddler in a diaper, the mother's objection is valid. The grandmother's edits might be causing more harm by implying the child's body is inappropriate. Therefore, the grandmother is in the wrong for altering the photos in a way that sexualizes the child. The mother's reaction, while firm, is a response to the grandmother's actions. So the answer would be that the author (mother) is not in the wrong.\n"
