Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom keeps editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done to male family members. The author told their mom not to post any more pictures of their daughter, and now they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around photographing children. In the US, there are laws about child pornography, which typically involve explicit sexual content. However, the photos here are of a toddler in a diaper, which might be considered appropriate as they're not explicit in the legal sense. But the mom is adding stickers to cover the nipples, which could be seen as trying to hide something, implying that the natural body parts are inappropriate. \n\nThe author's argument is that the mom is sexualizing the child by covering the nipples, which is different from how the nephew's photos are handled. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, suggesting she feels the need to censor the child's body parts. The author objects to this and stops the mom from posting any pictures, which is a strong response.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they feel that the censorship is unnecessary and potentially harmful. They might be right in that adding stickers could be seen as placing the child's body in a context that's inappropriate or sexualized. However, the author's response is to stop all posts, which might be extreme. But wait, maybe the mom's actions are the ones that are problematic, and the author is just trying to protect their child from being sexualized.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have a right to share family photos, and the author is overstepping by controlling her actions. But the author is the parent of the child, so they might have a valid right to decide how their child is represented. The key here is the mother-in-law editing the photos without the author's consent and adding elements that the author finds objectionable. \n\nI need to check if there's a standard about covering children's nipples in photos. In many cases, children's bodies are considered less sensitive, and covering them isn't necessary unless in a public context where modesty is expected. Since the photos are taken at home, the author might feel it's natural for the child to be in a diaper, and the mom's censorship is imposing her own views. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mom does the same to the nephew's photos but not covers them suggests that maybe the issue isn't about modesty but about gender. If the mom doesn't censor the nephew's photos, then covering the daughter's could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes or unnecessary censorship. \n\nThe author's action to stop the mom from posting any pictures is a response to protect their child from being sexualized. While it's a strong move, the mom's actions are the ones that are problematic. The author is likely not in the wrong because they are protecting their child's image and rights. The mom's editing is the issue here, not the author's objection. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are standing up against their mother's actions that they believe are inappropriate and potentially harmful to their child.\n"
