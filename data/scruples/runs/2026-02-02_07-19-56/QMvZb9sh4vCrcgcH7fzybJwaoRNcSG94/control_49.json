Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author objecting to their mother covering their daughter's chest in photos with stickers, which they find creepy and sexualizing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The mother (the author's mom) is posting photos of the child in a diaper, which is typical for a toddler. However, the mom adds heart or smiley face stickers over the nipples. The author finds this problematic, comparing it to how their nephew's unedited photos are posted. They tell their mother to stop posting the pictures entirely. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm, so let's break it down. The author's main concern is that covering the child's nipples is inappropriate and could be seen as sexualizing the child. The mother's reasoning is that the photos without the stickers are inappropriate for her friends. \n\nI need to consider the norms around photographing young children. Toddlers often aren't dressed in clothing that covers their bodies completely, especially at home. It's common for parents to post such photos without edits. However, when there's a parent (the author's mother) who is adding stickers, that might be an attempt to cover the child's body, possibly due to her own discomfort or societal norms. \n\nBut the author is against that. They find the stickers creepy and see it as unnecessary censorship. The mother is using the stickers to make the photos appropriate for her friends, but the author is telling her to stop posting the photos altogether. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is standing up for their belief that their child's body shouldn't be altered in photos in a way that implies the child is sexualized. The mother's action of adding stickers could be seen as infantilizing or as an unnecessary addition. On the other hand, the mother might feel that her friends would find the photos without stickers inappropriate. \n\nBut given that the child is a toddler, the natural state of her body is not considered sexualized. The mother's action might stem from her own biases or the norms of her social circle. The author's stance is that the child's body, like any toddler's, should be presented without alteration. The author is asserting control over their child's image, which is their right. \n\nThe mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but that's a subjective view. The author is correct in wanting their child's photos to be posted as they are, especially since the same isn't done for a nephew. The author isn't wrong in objecting to the edits. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
