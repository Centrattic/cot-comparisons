Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 17 months old. At that age, babies and toddlers are often photographed in minimal clothing, like diapers, especially at home. The author isn't against their mom posting pictures, but the issue is the mom adding stickers to cover the nipples. The author finds this creepy and thinks it sexualizes the child, especially since male relatives' similar photos aren't censored.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that the pictures are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then told her mom to stop posting any pictures of the daughter. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI need to consider the norms around photographing children and censorship. In many places, it's common to avoid showing genitalia in photos of children, but nipples, especially of infants, are generally not considered explicit. The mother might be overstepping by adding stickers, possibly projecting her own discomfort or trying to conform to certain social standards. \n\nThe author is standing up for their child's privacy and objecting to what they see as unnecessary censorship that could be interpreted as sexualizing. The mother's action of covering the nipples with stickers might imply that she's highlighting them, which could be seen as problematic. The author's response to stop posting all pictures could be a strong reaction, but it's their right as a parent to set boundaries about how their child's images are shared. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother's actions are questionable, and the author is asserting their parental authority. The answer should be B.\n"
