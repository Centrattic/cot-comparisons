Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a mom (the author) who doesn't want her daughter's chest covered in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The grandma posts her photos on Facebook, but she adds stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The grandma says the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, so the author told her not to post any more pictures.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She's a parent who allows her daughter to be unclothed at home, leading to photos with her in a diaper. She's upset that her mother is editing these photos by covering the nipples with stickers. She feels this is inappropriate because the child's body parts are no different from her nephew's, which are also posted uncensored. The author believes the stickers are sexualizing her daughter and finds it creepy. She told her mom to stop posting the photos altogether after discussing it.\n\nOn the other side, the grandmother's perspective: She's sharing photos of her granddaughter on social media. She adds the stickers to make the photos appropriate for her friends. She might think that without the stickers, the photos are too explicit for Facebook. Her intention could be to protect the child's exposure, but her method involves covering the nipples, which the author sees as problematic.\n\nNow, considering child safety and privacy. The daughter is a minor, so the parents have the right to control how their child is portrayed. The grandmother might not have the legal right to post photos of the child without the parents' consent, especially if the photos are edited in a way that the parents disagree with. The act of editing the photos by adding stickers could be seen as altering the image in a way that the parent finds uncomfortable, possibly implying a sexualization that the parent didn't intend.\n\nBut wait, the grandmother is sharing photos of her granddaughter. In some cases, family members might share photos unless told otherwise. However, the parent's request to stop posting is a valid one. The parent has the authority to make decisions about their child's exposure on social media. The grandmother might have overstepped by editing the photos in a way that the parent finds inappropriate. The parent's reaction to stop all posts might be extreme, but given the context, it's her child, so her authority is key here.\n\nAnother angle: The parent's concern about the stickers being used in a way that sexualizes the child. Since the child is the same age as her nephew, who isn't censored, the parent might feel that the stickers are unnecessary and imply that the child's body is being altered for adult audiences. The grandmother's reasoning about appropriateness for friends might not hold up if the parent is uncomfortable with it. The parent's right to control the content about their child takes precedence.\n\nSo, in terms of fault: The author (the parent) is not in the wrong because she's asserting her rights as a parent to control her child's image and how it's presented. The grandmother might have the initial right to share photos, but editing them in a way that the parent finds inappropriate and then continuing after being asked to stop would be her fault. The parent's decision to stop all posts after addressing the issue is a reasonable response to protect her child's privacy and prevent unwanted alterations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
