Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a mom who doesn't want her mother to cover her 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The grandmother is putting stickers over the nipples in the pictures she posts on Facebook. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. The daughter is a toddler, so she's very young. In many places, laws regarding child nudity are strict, but there's a difference between private family photos and public sharing. The grandmother is editing the photos before posting them, possibly to protect the child's modesty.\n\nThe user finds the stickers creepy and sees it as sexualizing, comparing it to how her nephew's photos aren't censored. The grandmother argues that the unedited photos are inappropriate for her friends. The user then asked the grandmother to stop posting the pictures entirely.\n\nI should think about the user's rights as a parent. They have the authority to make decisions about their child's upbringing and privacy. The grandmother might be overstepping by making decisions about how the child is presented online without consulting the parent. However, the user did ask the grandmother to stop posting, which could be seen as controlling the grandmother's behavior. But given that the grandmother is sharing the child's images, the parent has a right to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the age of the child matters. At 17 months, showing a child's body in photos is a sensitive issue. Some parents choose not to post such photos publicly to avoid any potential issues. The grandmother's use of stickers might be her way of making the photos more acceptable to her audience, but the parent might see it as unnecessary or even inappropriate.\n\nThe key points are the parent's right to control their child's image and privacy versus the grandmother's desire to share family moments. The parent's decision to ask the grandmother to stop posting is a reasonable boundary. The grandmother editing the photos might not be illegal, but it's a matter of personal preference and comfort. The parent's discomfort is valid, so they are not in the wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
