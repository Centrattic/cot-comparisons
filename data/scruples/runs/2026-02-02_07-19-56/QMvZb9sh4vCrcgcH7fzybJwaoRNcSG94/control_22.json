Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, and the parents let her run around in a diaper at home, so many photos are of her in that state. The mother posts these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the daughter's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's photos are posted without such edits. The mother argues that the photos without stickers are inappropriate for her friends. The author told her mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around children's photos and nudity. For infants and toddlers, it's common for them to be partially nude at home, especially in diaper changes or playtime. However, when sharing online, there's a debate about appropriateness. Some parents prefer to keep their kids' photos private, while others do share, sometimes with edits to cover genitalia or nipples. \n\nThe key point here is the mother's addition of stickers over the nipples. The author is uncomfortable with this, perceiving it as unnecessary and potentially sexualizing. The mother's reasoning is that the unedited photos are inappropriate for her friends. The author then tells her mom to stop posting any pictures of the daughter.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, photos of minors in non-sexual contexts are protected, but there's also consideration for privacy and public decency. The mother's action of editing the photos could be seen as an attempt to fit societal norms or her audience's expectations. However, the author's discomfort is valid, especially since their nephew's photos aren't censored. The mother's justification (that the unedited photos are inappropriate) might be her own belief, but the author has the right to set boundaries regarding how their child is portrayed publicly.\n\nThe author's response was to tell their mother to stop posting any pictures. This could be seen as a reasonable boundary, especially if the mother's edits are making the author uncomfortable. The author isn't objecting to the nudity itself but to the specific edits that they find problematic. The mother might have a different view on what's appropriate, but the author has the right to assert their preferences regarding their child's image.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer should be B.\n"
