Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a mother whose daughter is 17 months old. The mother lets the kid run around in just a diaper when at home, and they take a lot of pictures. The grandmother, the mother's mom, posts these pictures on Facebook but covers the daughter's nipples with heart or smiley stickers. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing the child, especially since the nephew's photos aren't censored that way. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nThe author then tells her mom not to post any more pictures of the daughter. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the parent versus the grandmother. The parent has the primary responsibility for the child's well-being and comfort. The grandmother is a relative, but she's not the primary caregiver. So, the parent's wishes should take precedence here.\n\nNext, the act of covering the child's nipples with stickers\u2014does that cross a line? The author feels it's sexualizing, especially since the nephew's photos are uncensored. The grandmother might argue that she's covering the child to protect their privacy or to make the photos more appropriate for her audience. But the parent is saying that the child should be shown as she is, and the grandmother's actions are unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of child safety and consent, the child can't consent to being photographed or edited. The parent is making decisions on the child's behalf. The grandmother's edits might be seen as adding elements that could be interpreted sexually, even if unintended. The parent is within their rights to object to how the child is being portrayed publicly.\n\nAlso, the fact that the grandmother is posting on her own Facebook doesn't give her the right to alter the child's image in a way the parent disagrees with. The parent should have the final say in how their child is presented publicly, especially if they find it inappropriate.\n\nSo, the author is standing up for their child's privacy and comfort, which is a valid concern. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, and the parent is correct in asking her to stop. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
