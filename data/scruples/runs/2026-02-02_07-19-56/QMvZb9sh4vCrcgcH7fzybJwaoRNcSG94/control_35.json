Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's mom editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by putting stickers over her nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mom says the pictures are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, so the author told her not to post any more photos of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and social norms. In many places, it's legal to take photos of children in the nude at home, especially in family settings, because it's considered normal and not intended for public distribution. However, when those photos are posted online, especially on social media, it can be a different situation. The key here is whether the photos are appropriate for the platform and the audience.\n\nThe author's mother is adding stickers to cover the nipples, implying that she thinks the photos as they are are not suitable for her friends. But the author argues that the child's nipples are no different from a boy's, and that the mother's action is sexualizing the child. The mother's reasoning might stem from a belief that even a child's body in a certain context could be seen as inappropriate, but the author is against that.\n\nFrom a privacy and child protection perspective, the author might be right in wanting to control how their daughter's image is shared. Parents have the right to decide what's best for their child's welfare. The mother's action of adding stickers could be seen as unnecessary and could potentially contribute to the sexualization of the child, which is a concern. The author is standing up for their child's privacy and comfort, which is a valid parental right.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be acting out of what she believes is appropriate for her social circle. However, the author has the authority to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure online. By addressing it and asking the mother to stop posting, the author is asserting their parental responsibility.\n\nIn terms of laws, if the photos were not altered, they might still be legal in a private context, but the act of adding stickers might imply the mother thinks they need covering up, which can suggest a problematic view. The author's stance is protective of their daughter's innocence and privacy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. They are taking a stand to protect their child from being sexualized, which is a responsible action. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are not appropriate in this case. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
