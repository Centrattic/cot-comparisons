Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom whose mother keeps editing their 17-month-old daughter's photos by covering her nipples with stickers. The author (the mom) is upset because she thinks this is creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. She told her mom not to post any pictures, and now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here. In the US, there are specific laws about privacy and the depiction of minors. However, the main issue here is the mother's action of adding stickers to cover the baby's nipples. The author is concerned that this might be seen as sexualizing the child, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe mother-in-law's reasoning is that the pictures are inappropriate for her friends without covering the child's nipples. But considering the child is 17 months old and the photos are from home, it's typical for toddlers to be photographed in diapers without clothing. The act of adding stickers over the nipples could be seen as unnecessary and possibly objectifying. \n\nThe author's decision to tell her mother not to post any more pictures is a boundary they set. However, the question is whether that boundary is reasonable. The author is not wrong in expressing discomfort with the editing. The mother-in-law's actions might be driven by her own discomfort or the norms of her social circle, but the author has the right to decide how their child is represented. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't just ask to stop the stickers but to stop all pictures. That might be an overreaction. Maybe a better approach would be to request only the stickers to be removed, allowing the photos to still be shared without the editing. By cutting off all photos, the author might be denying her mother the right to share family moments, which could be seen as a harsh measure. \n\nBut the key point is the author's concern about the stickers being creepy and sexualizing. That's a valid privacy and child protection issue. The mother-in-law's actions could indeed contribute to a sexualized portrayal, which is problematic. So, the author's stance is justified in wanting to prevent that. \n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by not allowing any photos. Perhaps they should engage in a more detailed conversation to address the stickers without altogether banning photos. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether there's a better way. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's primary issue with the stickers is valid, so they are not in the wrong for addressing it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
