Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's daughter is 17 months old, and they let her run around in a diaper at home. The mom posts these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing because the nipples are the same as a boy's. The mom says the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, so the author told her to stop posting the pictures entirely. Now the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nLet me break it down. The main points are about child privacy, appropriateness of photos, and the parent's authority over posting images of their child. The author is upset that the mom is censoring the photos with stickers, which they see as unnecessary and possibly harmful. The mom, on the other hand, thinks the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then tells the mom to stop posting any pictures of the daughter.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they don't want their child's body parts altered in a way that might imply something sexual. Since the child is a toddler, her body should be treated as neutral. The mom's action of adding stickers might be seen as drawing attention to the nipples, which could be problematic. The author's response is to stop the mom from posting any pictures, which is a strong action. Is that justified?\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that she's trying to protect her own social media audience by not showing what she considers inappropriate. But if the photos are of a toddler in a diaper, the presence of nipples is natural and not sexual in context. The stickers could be making the photos more explicit, which is the opposite of what's intended. The mom's reasoning might be based on a misunderstanding or societal norms that view children's bodies differently even when they're in such early stages.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and responsibilities. The author is the parent of the child and has the right to decide how their child's images are shared. The mother is the grandmother, and while she might have a say, the primary authority lies with the parent. The author is protecting their child's privacy and autonomy, which is a standard parental duty. By stopping the grandmother from posting, the author is asserting their role as the parent.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action (telling the mom to stop posting) is an overreaction. The author finds the stickers creepy and a form of sexualization, which is a valid concern. The mom's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but if the photos are of a toddler in a diaper, they are not inherently inappropriate for social media. The stickers might be adding an unnecessary element that's problematic. Therefore, the author's stance is about protecting their child from potential misuse or misinterpretation of the photos.\n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if they are in the wrong for not wanting the stickers and stopping the posts. Based on the analysis, the author's actions seem justified because they are protecting their child's image and privacy. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, and the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's portrayal. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
