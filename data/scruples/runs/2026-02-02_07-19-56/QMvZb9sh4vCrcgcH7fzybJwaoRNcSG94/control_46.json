Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom whose mother is posting photos of her 17-month-old daughter, usually in a diaper, and covering the nipples with stickers. The mom finds this creepy and sexualizing, while the grandmother argues that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The mom told her mother not to post more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The daughter is an infant, so her body is naturally uncensored in photos. The grandmother is adding stickers to cover the nipples, which the mom objects to. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The mom thinks the stickers are sexualizing her daughter, and the fact that the grandmother doesn't do the same for the nephew's photos (who is also uncensored) is a point in the mom's argument.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and child safety. In many places, photos of children in diapers are common, especially for infants and toddlers. The act of covering the nipples could be seen as unnecessary censorship, but the grandmother's friends might be in a different cultural or social context where they expect modesty. However, the mother's concern is about the stickers being creepy and sexualizing. There's a difference between protecting privacy and adding something that could imply sexual content. \n\nAlso, the grandmother's behavior of doing this for the daughter but not the nephew raises a red flag. If the nephew's photos are uncensored, but the daughter's are covered, it might indicate a different perception of the two children's bodies, possibly influenced by gender. That could be a form of sexism or unnecessary emphasis on female modesty from an early age.\n\nLegal aspects: In some places, it's illegal to distribute explicit images of minors. However, a diapered infant's body is not considered explicit, so the grandmother's actions might be overstepping by adding stickers, which could be seen as drawing attention to the area unnecessarily. The mother has the right to control how her child's images are shared, especially if she finds the alterations inappropriate.\n\nThe grandmother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. But if the photos are of a toddler in a diaper, they are not inherently inappropriate. The mother is within her rights to set boundaries on how her child's photos are shared. The grandmother should respect that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the mother is not in the wrong for asking her mother to stop posting the altered photos. The grandmother's actions are adding an element that the mother finds creepy and unnecessary, and the mother has the right to protect her child's image in this way. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
