Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a mom's mother posting photos of her 17-month-old granddaughter, covering her nipples with stickers. The author is upset about this because they think it's sexualizing the child, while the mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is naturally unclothed in the photos. The grandmother is covering the nipples, which are a natural part of the body. The author feels this is creepy and sexualizes the child. The grandmother's friends might be seeing these photos, but the author is objecting to the censorship.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, there are laws about child pornography, but photos of a child in a diaper without sexual context are generally allowed. However, the act of censoring the nipples might be drawing unnecessary attention to the body parts, which could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nEthically, the author's concern is valid because the stickers could be perceived as trying to hide the child's natural body parts, which might lead to a more conservative view of the body. The grandmother's friends might have different standards, but the author has the right to set boundaries for their child's privacy and how her image is shared. \n\nThe author addressed the issue calmly by telling the mother not to post more pictures. That seems like a reasonable response. The mother's action of covering the nipples could be motivated by her own discomfort or the expectations of her social circle, but the child's best interest should be prioritized. Since the child is a minor, the parents have authority over decisions regarding their child's portrayal. The grandmother might not have the right to make those decisions without the parents' consent. \n\nSo the author is standing up for their child's dignity and privacy. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's making decisions about how the child is presented online. Therefore, the author is in the right to object and set that boundary.\n"
