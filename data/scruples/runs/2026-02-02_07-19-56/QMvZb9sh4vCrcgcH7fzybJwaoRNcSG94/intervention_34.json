Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother not wanting her mom to cover her toddler's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so completely nude photos would typically be considered appropriate in a family context, especially since the child is a toddler.\n\nThe mother's mom is editing the photos to cover the child's nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The grandmother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends. The author then tells her mom not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, nude photos of children under a certain age (like 5 or 6) are not considered illegal if taken by a parent and shared within the family. However, posting them online can be a gray area, depending on the platform's policies and local laws. The key here is that the author is uncomfortable with the censorship and the sexualization aspect.\n\nThe grandmother is adding stickers over the nipples, which the author perceives as unnecessary and potentially problematic. The author's concern is valid because adding stickers might imply that the child's body is something to be hidden or altered, which could be seen as sexualizing. The fact that the nephew's photos are uncensored shows a double standard, which the author is pointing out.\n\nWhen the author addressed this, the grandmother's response was that the photos were inappropriate without the stickers. The author then told her mom to stop posting. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, the author has the right to decide how their child's images are shared. The grandmother, while a family member, doesn't have the authority to edit or post photos of another person's child without consent. The author's actions to stop the posts could be seen as protecting their child's privacy and preventing potential exploitation or sexualization. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The grandmother's actions might be crossing a line by altering the photos in a way that could be seen as inappropriate. The author's response to stop the posts altogether is a reasonable step to protect their child. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are advocating for their child's rights and privacy.\n"
