Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17 months old. At that age, babies often aren't wearing clothes, especially at home, so pictures of a diaper is normal. The author's mom is posting these photos on Facebook but adds heart or smiley face stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. The mom argues that the photos without stickers are inappropriate for her friends, so the author told her not to post any more pictures.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about appropriateness, censorship, and the parent's control over their child's images. The author's concern is that covering the nipples is unnecessary and adds a sexualized element. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. But the author is saying that the child's nipples are natural and shouldn't be censored, unlike a boy's. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's illegal to post explicit images of minors without consent, but a diaper is considered appropriate. However, the stickers might be over the top. The mom might think her friends are too prude or that the photos are too revealing, but the author disagrees. The author's stance is about protecting their child from being sexualized, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe mom's action of adding stickers could be seen as objectifying the child. The author is asserting their right to control how their child is represented online. The mom's friends might be the target audience, but the parent's consent and comfort matter. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right as a parent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They are standing up for their child's dignity and their own parenting choices. The answer should be B.\n"
