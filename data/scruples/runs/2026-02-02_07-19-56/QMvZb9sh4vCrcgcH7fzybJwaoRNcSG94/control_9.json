      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's daughter is a toddler who often wears just a diaper, so the photos are of her in that state. The mother (author's mom) posts these photos on Facebook but edits them by covering the nipples with heart or smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing the child. They mention that their nephew's photos aren't censored, so the issue seems specific to the daughter. The author's mom argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author told her to stop posting the pictures altogether. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. At 17 months, it's normal for a child to be nude or in a diaper at home. Parents often take such photos as part of everyday life, especially before potty training. The key here is the mother's editing. By adding stickers over the nipples, is she implying something inappropriate? The author feels it's sexualizing the child, which might be a valid concern because adding symbols like hearts or smiley faces could be seen as trying to make the image more palatable or even as a form of soft pornography. \n\nHowever, the author's mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. That suggests she might think showing the child's body in that state is too revealing for Facebook. But the author's nephew's photos aren't censored, which raises the question of why the daughter's are. There might be an underlying issue of treating girls differently, perhaps objectifying the female body even at a young age. \n\nThe author's response was to tell their mom not to post any more pictures. That could be seen as overreacting if the mom's intention was innocent. But considering the author's discomfort and the potential for misinterpretation, maybe it's a reasonable boundary. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents do have some rights to photograph their children, but there are laws against child pornography. However, this is a 17-month-old, so it's not illegal in most places as long as it's taken in a private setting and used appropriately. The stickers might be an attempt to make the images look less explicit, but if the author feels it's inappropriate, they have the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe author is also protecting their child's privacy and future. Even if the photos are not illegal now, they could be seen as inappropriate later when the child is older. The author is probably thinking about how these photos might affect their daughter's perception of her body and how others might view her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom might feel that the author is being overly cautious or not trusting her intentions. But the mom's choice to edit the photos in that specific way could indicate her own discomfort or a desire to present the child in a certain way, which might not align with the author's values. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for parents to post cute or candid photos of their kids, but when it comes to nudity, there's a line. The addition of stickers could be seen as trying to make the image more palatable to others, but it might also draw unnecessary attention to the child's body. The author's decision to stop the posts is about protecting their child's image and respecting their own boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They are setting a boundary to protect their child from potential sexualization and respecting their own discomfort with the edits. The mother's actions could be seen as problematic, even if she didn't intend it that way. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
