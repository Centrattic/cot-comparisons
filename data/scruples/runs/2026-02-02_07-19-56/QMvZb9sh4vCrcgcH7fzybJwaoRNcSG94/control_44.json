When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is about a mother (the author) whose mother is posting pictures of her 17-month-old daughter on Facebook. The grandmother is covering the baby's nipples with heart or smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since boys' uncensored photos are also posted. The grandmother says the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author tells her not to post any more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, under two years old. The photos are of her in a diaper, so the exposure is minimal. The author is concerned that the stickers make it seem sexualized, while the grandmother is covering the nipples out of concern for appropriateness. The author is objecting to the edits but also wants to stop all postings, which might be a conflict.\n\nLegally, in many places, parents can photograph their children, but there are laws about indecent exposure of minors. The grandmother might be covering the nipples to comply with Facebook's policies or her own comfort level. However, the author's issue is that covering the nipples with stickers adds an unnecessary sexualized element, which the author finds creepy. The fact that boys are uncensored suggests that the grandmother sees a difference between girls and boys in this context, which the author is pointing out as double standard.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting their daughter from being sexualized, which is a valid concern. The grandmother's reasoning is based on her own perception of appropriateness, which might not align with the author's. The author is asking if they're wrong for objecting to the edits and stopping the postings.\n\nI should also consider the dynamics. The author is the child's parent, so they have the authority to make decisions about their child's privacy and image. The grandmother, while well-intentioned, might not be considering the long-term implications of editing the photos in that way. The author's request to stop posting any pictures could be seen as an overreaction if the grandmother's original intent was just to make the photos family-appropriate. But the key here is that the author finds the edits problematic, not the photos themselves. The author might be justified in wanting the edits to stop, but if they're also blocking all posts, that might be where the conflict lies.\n\nHowever, since the author is the parent, their decision to set boundaries about how their child is represented online is generally their right. The grandmother's actions, while maybe well-meaning, could be contributing to a sexualized view of the child, which the author is rightfully objecting to. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
