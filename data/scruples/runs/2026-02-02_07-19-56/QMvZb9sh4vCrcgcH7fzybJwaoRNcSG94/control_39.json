To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers. \n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is a toddler who often wears just a diaper. The grandmother posts photos, but covers the baby's nipples with heart or smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for their nephew's photos. The mom argues the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author told her not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nSo, the key points here are about appropriate photos of children, censorship, and what's considered sexualizing. The author is against the stickers because they think it's unnecessary and sends the wrong message. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, implying that the default is okay, but for her audience, they need to be covered. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's acceptable to take photos of children in the nude at a young age, especially in a private setting. The author is concerned about the sexualization aspect. The grandmother's action of adding stickers might be an attempt to make the photos more \"acceptable\" for her friends, but the author sees it as adding unnecessary emphasis on the child's body parts. \n\nThe ethical angle here is about the parent's right to decide how their child is represented online. The author believes that covering the baby's nipples with stickers is inappropriate and could lead to sexualizing the child. The grandmother's justification is a bit confusing\u2014why are the nephew's photos okay without any editing, but the granddaughter's need to be covered? That discrepancy might indicate the grandmother's own biases, perhaps seeing the granddaughter as more sexual at a younger age, which could be problematic.\n\nThe author's response was to tell their mom to stop posting any pictures of the daughter. That's a strong stance, but it's their right as the parent. They might be overstepping by cutting off all photos, but their concern is valid. The grandmother might be overstepping by adding stickers. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might find it okay to post photos of young kids without undergarments, especially in a home setting, but others might find it inappropriate. The use of stickers to cover nipples is where it gets tricky. The author's discomfort is understandable, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. The grandmother's reasoning is based on her friends' preferences, which might not be the author's concern.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's stance is about protecting their child from potential sexualization and ensuring that photos are appropriate as per their parenting decisions. The grandmother is interfering by adding her own edits. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if their solution is to stop all photos. They have the right to control how their child is represented, especially if they believe the edits are harmful. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
