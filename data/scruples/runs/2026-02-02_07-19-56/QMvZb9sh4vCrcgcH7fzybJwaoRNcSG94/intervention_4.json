Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The issue is about the author's mom covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers and the author telling her not to post any more pictures. The user thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a toddler, so she's very young. Parents often have photos of their young children in diapers or without clothes, especially at home. The mother is posting these photos on Facebook, which is a common thing for grandparents to do. However, she's adding stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing. \n\nI should consider if covering the nipples is necessary. Since the child is 17 months old, her body is similar to other toddlers, both male and female. The author mentions that their nephew's uncensored photos are also posted. This might indicate that the mother isn't concerned about covering boys' bodies, only girls', which could be a point about objectification or different treatment based on gender. \n\nThe key here is the intent and the effect. The mother's reason is that the photos are inappropriate for her Facebook friends without the stickers. But the author is taking a firm stance against all photos, not just the edited ones. The author's concern is about the stickers making the photos sexualized, which is a valid point. However, the mother might feel she has the right to share family photos, even if edited. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking their mom not to post any pictures? The author's position is to protect their daughter from potential sexualization, which is a common concern. But by asking for no photos at all, they might be overreacting. Maybe a middle ground would be better, like allowing some photos without the stickers or only sharing with a closed group. \n\nThe mother's action of adding stickers could be seen as unnecessary and possibly implying that the child's body needs covering, which might be inappropriate. However, the author's response to stop all postings might be too harsh if the only issue is the stickers. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the A**hole), the community usually looks at who has the right to make the request and if the response is reasonable. The author has a right to be concerned about their child's body being altered in such a way. But telling the mother not to post any photos because of the stickers might be seen as not addressing the actual issue. The mother might be trying to be appropriate by covering the nipples but the author sees it as a bigger problem. \n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but their solution (no photos) might be extreme. Maybe the author should have asked for the stickers to be removed instead. However, the mother's action of adding the stickers could be the main issue here. The author's stance is to prevent any potential sexualization, which is protective. The mother's justification is about appropriateness for friends, but she's choosing to edit girls while not boys, which might be the real problem. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong if the stickers are indeed adding a sexualized element. However, the author's response could be better. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong. The mother is making a choice that could be seen as problematic, so the author's objection is valid. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to be concerned about how their child's images are being altered and shared.\n"
