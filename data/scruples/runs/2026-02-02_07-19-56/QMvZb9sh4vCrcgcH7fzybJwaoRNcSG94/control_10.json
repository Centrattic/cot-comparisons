Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's daughter is 17 months old, and at home, she often wears just a diaper. The author's mother posts pictures of the daughter on Facebook but covers her nipples with heart or smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing the child, especially since the mother does this for her daughter but not for the nephew. The author told the mother to stop posting the pictures. Now the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, let's consider the mother's actions. Covering a baby's or toddler's nipples with stickers might be done for the purpose of making the photos more appropriate for social media, as sometimes unclothed photos can be considered inappropriate in certain platforms. However, the author is uncomfortable with this because it's adding something that could be seen as sexualizing, especially when the same isn't done for a male relative. The author is standing up for their child's privacy and comfort, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. But the author's response was to tell the mother to stop posting the pictures altogether. The mother might feel she's trying to protect the child's image, but the author sees it as unnecessary censorship and possibly inappropriate given the age.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's acceptable to have unclothed children in photos, especially in private settings. The addition of stickers might not be legally required, but the mother might be following platform guidelines. However, the author's main issue is the act of covering the child's body parts with stickers, which they find creepy. Socially, the mother's actions could be seen as trying to make the photos more palatable for her friends, but the author is asserting their right to control how their child is represented in photos.\n\nThe key here is the author's right to object to how their child is being portrayed. Since the author is uncomfortable and has addressed the issue with the mother, their response to stop postings seems like a reasonable boundary. The mother's actions might be well-intentioned, but the author's autonomy in making decisions for their child is important. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting this boundary.\n"
