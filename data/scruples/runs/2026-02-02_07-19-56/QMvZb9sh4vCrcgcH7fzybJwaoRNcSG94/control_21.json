Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of their 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers and posting them on Facebook. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same treatment isn't given to the nephew's photos. The mother argues the photos are inappropriate without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The child is a toddler, so her body is naturally unclothed in many home photos. The mother's action is to cover the nipples, which the author sees as unnecessary and inappropriate. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without editing. \n\nI should think about societal norms. In many places, it's common for parents to share photos of their children in various states of dress, but there's a fine line between innocent and sexualizing. Covering a toddler's nipples might be seen as drawing unnecessary attention to them, which could be perceived as sexualizing. The fact that the nephew's photos aren't censored suggests a gender bias, which the author is pointing out.\n\nLegal aspects might also matter. In some regions, there are laws about child nudity, but typically for public sharing. However, if the photos are of a very young child in a private setting, they might be considered appropriate without censorship. The mother's editing could be seen as adding an element that wasn't there, which might be worse than the original photo.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the mother not to post any more pictures. That's a strong action, but given the concern about their child's image being altered and shared in a way they find inappropriate, it's a valid parental stance. The mother's actions might cross into overstepping by editing the photos without consent, especially when the parent objects.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the mother is the one making the edits and sharing them, so she's likely in the wrong. The author is standing up for their child's dignity and privacy, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
