Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of their 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author then tells their mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The child is 17 months old, so very young. The mother-in-law is posting photos of the child in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. The issue is the addition of stickers over the nipples. The author finds this inappropriate, while the mother thinks the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's illegal to distribute explicit images of minors, but this is a diaper-wearing toddler, so probably not considered explicit in that sense. However, the act of digitally altering the photos to cover the nipples might be seen as unnecessary. The author's concern is that this could be sexualizing the child, which is a valid concern. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but given the child's age, it's unclear why the stickers are needed. \n\nEthically, the parents have the right to control how their child's images are shared. The author is setting a boundary, which is understandable. The mother is overstepping by making edits that the parents don't agree with. The fact that the same mother doesn't edit photos of the nephew suggests a double standard, which could imply that the stickers are adding a sexualized element where there isn't one naturally. \n\nThe author's response is to tell the mother not to post any more photos. While that might be a firm stance, it's their right to protect their child's privacy. However, an alternative could have been to ask the mother to stop editing the photos rather than a total ban. But given the mother's insistence on altering the photos, the author's decision might be justified. \n\nIn terms of fault, the mother is the one making the edits without the parents' consent, which is the main issue. The author is trying to stop something they find inappropriate. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're protecting their child from potential sexualization.\n"
