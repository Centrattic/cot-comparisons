Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom (the author) not wanting her mother to cover her 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The grandmother is editing the photos by putting stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author told her mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and societal norms. In the US, it's legal to publish photos of minors in certain contexts, but there's a line when it comes to nudity. However, a baby in a diaper with just the chest area visible might not be considered explicit. The key here is whether covering the nipples is necessary or if it adds a sexualized element. The author argues that the stickers make it creepy, while the grandmother thinks the uncensored photos are inappropriate for her friends. \n\nThe grandmother's reasoning is that she's covering the child for her friends' benefit. But the author is upset because the act of censoring the child in this way is making the photos more sexualized. The author's stance is about protecting her daughter's image and preventing unnecessary censorship that adds a sexual connotation. \n\nLegally, there's no law against censoring photos of minors, but the act of adding stickers could be seen as adding a sexualized element. Ethically, some might argue that covering a child's natural body parts in this way is inappropriate, especially when the child is otherwise clothed (in a diaper). The author's decision to tell her mother to stop posting is her right as a parent, asserting her authority over her child's image.\n\nThe grandmother might have good intentions, but her actions are conflicting with the author's parental decisions. The author is within her rights to object to how her mother is editing and posting the photos. The grandmother's friends might find the original photos inappropriate, but the author's concern is about the editing, not the nudity itself. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting her child's image and asserting her parental authority. The grandmother's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are overstepping by adding the stickers, which the author finds problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
