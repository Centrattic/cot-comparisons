Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos.\n\nSo the situation is that the daughter is 17 months old and often wears just a diaper. The mom (the author's mother) posts photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the baby's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew is also in photos without such censorship. The mother argues that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then told the mother not to post more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and norms around child nudity in photos. In many places, it's legal to have photos of young children without clothing, especially in non-sexual contexts. The mother's action of covering the nipples with stickers might imply she feels they're inappropriate, but the author is opposing that. The key here is the intent behind the censorship. The mother's rationale is that her friends might find the photos inappropriate without the stickers. But the author is concerned that the act of covering the nipples could be seen as sexualizing the child, especially since a boy is not censored the same way. \n\nI should also consider the author's stance. They are standing up for their child's privacy and how their photos are presented. The mother's editing might be a way to make the photos more acceptable for her audience, but the author feels it's unnecessary and potentially harmful. The author's request to stop posting is about protecting their daughter's image and preventing any unintended implications. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not allowing the mother to edit the photos in that way. Legally, the author has the right to control how their child is portrayed, especially if they're the parent. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping, but she's the grandmother. However, the author is the primary guardian, so their decision should hold. \n\nThe mother's reasoning that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers is subjective. If the photos are of a toddler in a diaper, the presence of nipples is natural, and covering them might be more about the grandmother's comfort with her Facebook friends rather than the child's need. The author's discomfort with the sexualization is valid because adding stickers could draw unnecessary attention to the area, making it seem more explicit than it is. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries about how their child's photos are shared. They have the right to protect their child's image and decide what's appropriate for public sharing. The mother's edits might stem from her own preferences, but the author's decision to stop the posts is reasonable.\n"
