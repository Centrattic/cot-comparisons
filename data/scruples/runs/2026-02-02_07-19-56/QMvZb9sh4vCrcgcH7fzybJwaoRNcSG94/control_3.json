Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author told their mother not to post any more pictures, and now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around photographing children. In many places, it's legal to take and share photos of your own children, even if they're in diapers. However, there's a debate about whether covering a child's body in photos is necessary or appropriate. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, so she uses stickers. The author disagrees, feeling that the mother's action is sexualizing the child.\n\nThe key points here are consent, privacy, and the mother-in-law's actions. The author is the parent, so they have the authority to make decisions regarding their child's privacy. The mother is acting on her own judgment, which the author finds problematic. The author's stance is that the child's body parts aren't different from a boy's, so there's no need to cover them. The mother's action might be seen as adding unnecessary attention to the child's body, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nLegally, in the U.S., for example, there's no law against parents sharing photos of their young children in diapers, especially at 17 months. However, some platforms like Facebook have policies against nudity, so covering might be to comply with that. But the parent (author) is the legal guardian, so they have the right to dictate how their child's images are shared. The mother is overstepping by editing the photos without consulting the parent further, especially after the parent has expressed discomfort.\n\nThe author's action of telling their mother to stop posting is within their rights as the parent. They are protecting their child's privacy and objecting to what they see as sexualization. The mother's friends might find the photos inappropriate, but that's a separate issue from the parent's control over their child's image.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a growing movement to not sexualize children's bodies, and allowing them to be nude in a safe, private environment is sometimes considered normal. However, public sharing can be tricky. The mother's use of stickers could be seen as adding a layer that the parent doesn't want, implying that the child's body needs to be altered for others' comfort.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to protect their child's image and express discomfort with the mother's editing. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are not the parent's decision to make. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
