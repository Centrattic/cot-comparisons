Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. \n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The parents let her run around in a diaper at home, so the photos are of her in her diaper. The mom is posting these photos on Facebook but adding stickers over the daughter's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos (without censorship) are also posted. The mom argues the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author told her not to post any more.\n\nSo, the author is upset about the stickers being added. They see it as unnecessary and potentially inappropriate. The mom's reasoning is that the photos without stickers are inappropriate for her friends. The author's stance is about the censorship being wrong, while the mom is trying to cover up what she considers inappropriateness.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong here. The key points are about the appropriateness of the photos and the censorship. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is not sexual in any way. The stickers might be adding a layer that the author finds inappropriate. Also, the mom's friends might find the uncensored photos inappropriate, but the author's main issue is with the censorship. \n\nFrom a privacy and parental rights perspective, the author has the right to decide how their child's photos are shared. The mom's friends' standards might differ, but the author is the parent and has authority over their child's image. The act of adding stickers could be seen as unnecessary, especially if the photos are of a diaper-clad toddler. The author's request to stop posting is reasonable because they are the parent. \n\nThe mom's argument that the photos are inappropriate without stickers might be based on her friends' preferences, but that doesn't override the author's right to control their child's image. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
