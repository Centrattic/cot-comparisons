Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The daughter is 17 months old, and the family lets her run around in a diaper at home. The mom posts these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, pointing out that the same is not done for the nephew. The mom's response is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then told the mom not to post any more pictures of their daughter.\n\nThe user thinks they might be in the wrong. So, the question is whether the author is the a**hole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The daughter is very young, 17 months. The photos are from home where the child is in a diaper. The mom is editing the photos to cover the nipples with stickers. The author is uncomfortable with this and feels the mom is sexualizing the child. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then told the mom to stop posting any pictures.\n\nNow, family dynamics and boundaries are at play here. The author is the parent, so they have the right to set boundaries regarding their child's privacy and how they're portrayed. The mom is the grandmother, and while she may have good intentions, she's sharing photos of her grandchild on social media, which the parent has to approve or object to.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is wrong to tell the mom to stop posting the photos. The author is concerned about the sexualization of the child, which is a valid concern. The mom's action of adding stickers to the nipples could be seen as highlighting the child's body in a way that the author finds inappropriate. The fact that the same is not done for the nephew suggests that the mom may have different standards for her granddaughters vs grandsons, which adds to the author's discomfort.\n\nThe parent has the right to protect their child's image and decide what is appropriate. The author's response was to ask the mom to stop posting any pictures, not just the ones with stickers. This could be seen as a reasonable boundary to protect the child's privacy and ensure that the photos shared online are appropriate. The mom's friends might have different levels of appropriateness, but the parent's primary concern is their child's well-being and how she's portrayed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have been more specific, telling the mom to stop adding the stickers rather than all pictures. But the author's main issue is with the stickers covering the nipples, which they find creepy and sexualizing. Stopping all pictures might be a way to enforce the boundary without conflict. The mom's friends might not be okay with the uncensored photos, but that's the parent's call to make regarding their child's exposure online.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate about photographing children in certain ways and sharing them online. The parent's right to control their child's image is significant. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting that boundary, even if it upsets the grandparent. The sexualization aspect is a key point here. The author's reaction is based on concern for their daughter's dignity and protection from being objectified, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries for their child's online presence. The mom's actions, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping, and the author's response is a reasonable way to enforce those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
