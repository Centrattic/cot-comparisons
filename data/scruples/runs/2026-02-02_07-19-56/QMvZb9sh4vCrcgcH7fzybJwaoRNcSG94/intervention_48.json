Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in pictures. The mom is posting photos of the toddler, who's undressed, and adding stickers over the nipples. The author feels it's creepy and sexualizing, especially since other kids' photos aren't censored like that. They told their mom not to post any more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is developing naturally, and her nipples aren't a sensitive area in the same way as for an adult. The mother is editing the photos with stickers, which the author finds inappropriate. The mother's reasoning is that her friends wouldn't see the uncensored photos of the nephew, so maybe she's trying to make the daughter's photos fit a certain standard of modesty for her social circle. \n\nBut here's the thing: adding stickers to cover a child's nipples can be seen as unnecessary. The author is concerned about sexualization, which is a valid worry. Children's bodies, regardless of gender, are not inherently sexual. The mother's action might be projecting adult norms onto a toddler's body, which could be a red flag. Also, the fact that the nephew's photos are not censored suggests there might be a double standard based on gender, which is a significant point. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, it's actually illegal to censor a child's body in photos unless there's a specific reason, like for a medical condition or to protect privacy in certain contexts. But here, the context is social media. However, the main issue is not about legality but about appropriateness and the parent's right to control their child's image. The author is a parent, so they have the authority to decide what is acceptable regarding their child's photos. \n\nThe mother's justification is about her friends finding the photos inappropriate, but the author says the same photos of the nephew are not censored. That could indicate that the mother is being more protective of the daughter's image than the nephew's, which might stem from biases about girls' bodies being different or more \"inappropriate\" to display. That's a problematic attitude. \n\nWhen the author addressed the issue, the mother didn't stop but instead continued with the censorship, leading the author to tell her not to post any pictures. The author is asserting their parental rights here. The mother might have overstepped by altering the photos in a way that the parent doesn't consent to. \n\nSo, considering all these points: the child's age, the gender-based double standard, the potential for sexualization, and the parent's right to control their child's image, the author is likely not in the wrong. They have a valid concern and are setting boundaries for their child's well-being. The mother's actions could be seen as problematic, so the author's stance makes sense.\n"
