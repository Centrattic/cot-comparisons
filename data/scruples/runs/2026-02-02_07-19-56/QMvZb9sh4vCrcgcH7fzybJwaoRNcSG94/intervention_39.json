Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The situation is that the OP's mom is editing photos of their 17-month-old daughter, adding heart or smiley face stickers over the nipples. The OP finds this creepy and sexualizing, while their mom argues the photos are inappropriate without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 17 months, she's a toddler, and it's common for parents to dress them in minimal clothing, especially at home. The mom's action of covering the nipples with stickers might be an attempt to make the photos more socially acceptable for sharing, but the OP sees it as unnecessary and potentially problematic.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, the parent's role, and societal norms. The OP is the parent, so they have the authority to decide what's appropriate for their child. The mother is the grandmother, who is acting without the child's parent's consent. Even if the grandmother has good intentions, she shouldn't make decisions about the child's photos that the parent disagrees with. \n\nThe mother's argument is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. But the OP is saying that the child's body is the same as their nephew's, who isn't censored. This suggests that the grandmother might be projecting her own discomfort or societal norms onto the child's image. \n\nThe OP stood their ground by telling the mother not to post any more photos, which is a valid response to protect their child's privacy and how they want their child's image presented. The grandmother overstepped by editing the photos without the parent's approval. So, the OP isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to decide how their child is represented publicly.\n"
