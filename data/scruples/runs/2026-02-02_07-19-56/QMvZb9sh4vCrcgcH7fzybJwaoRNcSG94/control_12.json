Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is 17 months old, and the mom (the author) lets her run around in a diaper at home. The grandmother posts these photos on Facebook but covers the nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for a nephew. The grandmother argues the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, so the author tells her not to post any more pictures. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, legal and social norms about children's nudity in photos. In the US, there's a difference between private and public contexts. At home, parents often let toddlers be naked, and photos are common. But posting them online can be tricky. Some people might find it inappropriate, even if it's just a diaper. The grandmother's action of covering the nipples with stickers might be an overreaction, but she's trying to make the photos acceptable for her audience. \n\nThe author's concern about sexualization is valid. Covering a girl's body in a way that a boy's isn't could imply a double standard, which can be seen as promoting the idea that girls' bodies need to be hidden, contributing to objectification. The author is standing up for their child's autonomy and rejecting what they see as unnecessary censorship. However, the grandmother might feel she's acting in the child's best interest by avoiding potential backlash or discomfort. \n\nThe key here is consent. As the parent, the author has the authority to make decisions about their child's exposure in photos. The grandmother, while well-meaning, might be overstepping by editing and posting without consulting the parents. The author's response to stop all posts is a firm boundary, which is their right. The grandmother's justification that the photos are inappropriate without covering is subjective. The author's stance against sexualization is a valid parental concern. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't wrong. They're protecting their child's dignity and rejecting practices that could be seen as sexualizing. The answer should be B (No).\n"
