Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they told their mom not to post photos of their 17-month-old daughter in a diaper, especially after the mom started adding stickers over the nipples. The author thinks they might be in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a toddler, so under 2 years old. In many cultures, showing a child's body in such photos isn't considered sexual, especially since they're in a diaper and just playing. The mom is editing the photos by covering the nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the mother is adding these stickers, which they see as unnecessary and possibly sexualizing. The mom, on the other hand, might feel that even a toddler's body parts are too revealing for her social media audience. The author then asked the mom to stop posting the pictures altogether, which is a strong reaction. \n\nI need to consider the rights of the parent versus the parent's autonomy. The author is the parent, so they have the right to decide what to do with their child's photos. The mother is a grandparent, but she's adding her own edits and posting without the author's consent beyond just allowing the photos to be shared. \n\nThe author might be overreacting to the mother's edits, but the mother might be overstepping by altering the photos and making a judgment about what's appropriate. The key point is whether covering the nipples is necessary. Since the child is a toddler, the body parts aren't sexual in this context. The mother's action could be seen as adding a layer of sexualization by covering them, implying that they are inappropriate. \n\nThe author's decision to tell the mother to stop posting entirely might be a bit extreme, but given the mother's edits, the author has the right to set boundaries. The mother's friends' sensitivities don't justify altering the child's image in a way that the parent finds uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to control how their child's images are presented, especially if they find the edits problematic. The mother's actions could be seen as overreaching, and the author is justified in setting that boundary.\n"
