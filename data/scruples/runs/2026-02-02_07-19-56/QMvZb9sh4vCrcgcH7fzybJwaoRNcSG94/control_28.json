Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. The mom is posting a lot of photos of the daughter, who's often in a diaper, and adding stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's photos aren't censored the same way. The mom argues that the pictures are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends. The author then told the mom not to post any more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, there are laws about child pornography, but showing a toddler's body in a diaper isn't automatically illegal. However, there's also the aspect of what's considered appropriate. The mom is adding stickers over the nipples, which implies she's covering them. But the author is concerned that this is sexualizing their daughter. The key here is the intent behind the censorship. If the mom is covering the body parts to make them more acceptable for social media, but the act of doing so could be seen as drawing attention to those areas, making them seem sexual, that's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is the parent, so they have the right to control how their child is portrayed publicly. The mom's friends might find the photos inappropriate without the stickers, but the author's daughter is just a toddler, and the photos are of her in a diaper, which is typical for a child. The fact that the nephew's photos aren't censored suggests inconsistency from the mom. The author's discomfort is valid because the stickers might be highlighting the body parts unnecessarily, leading to a sexual connotation. \n\nThe author is standing up for their child's dignity and privacy. The mom's actions, while perhaps intended to make the photos acceptable, could be causing harm by objectifying the child. The author's response to stop all postings is a way to prevent any further issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries for their child's image and privacy. The mom's actions might be well-intentioned, but they cross a line by altering the photos in a way that the author finds inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
