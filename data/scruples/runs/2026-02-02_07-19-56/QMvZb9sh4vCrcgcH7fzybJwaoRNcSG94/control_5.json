Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The situation is about a 17-month-old toddler who often wears just a diaper, leading to photos with visible nipples. The mother adds stickers to cover them, but the author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing, especially since the uncle's similar photos aren't censored. The author then told their mom not to post more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about the appropriateness of the photos and the mother's actions. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about the privacy and safety of children in photos. While a diaper is generally considered appropriate, the presence of nipples might be a point of contention depending on cultural or personal views. The author's concern is that adding stickers to cover the nipples is sexualizing the child, which is a valid concern because even unintentionally, altering a child's image in that way could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's reasoning is that the photos are \"inappropriate\" for her friends without the stickers. This suggests she might be trying to adhere to social norms or standards she feels are necessary for her audience. However, the author points out that the nephew's similar photos are uncensored, which implies there's inconsistency in how she treats photos of different children. \n\nThe author is asserting their right to control how their child's images are shared, especially if they find the editing to be creepy. They have a right to privacy and to set boundaries regarding their daughter's portrayal. The mother's action of adding stickers might be well-intentioned, but it's important that she respects the child's parent's wishes. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their child's dignity and privacy. The mother might have overstepped by editing the photos without consulting the author, especially since the author didn't like the changes. The fact that the author's nephew's photos aren't censored supports that the mother's action is biased or unnecessary in this case. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
