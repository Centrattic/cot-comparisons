Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest with stickers in photos before posting on Facebook. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. The mom argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a toddler, and it's common for young children to be undressed at home. The mother is editing the photos, which the author is now objecting to. The main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom not to post the pictures.\n\nFrom a privacy and child safety perspective, parents have the right to decide how their children are portrayed in public. The author is the parent, so they have the authority to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure. The mother-in-law's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might be overstepping by altering the photos in a way the author finds uncomfortable. The fact that the stickers are adding something (hearts, smiley faces) could be seen as drawing unnecessary attention to the child's body, which the author objects to as sexualizing. \n\nThe mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author disagrees. The author has the right to decide what is appropriate for their child's public image. Since the child is underage, the parents' consent is crucial. The author is acting to protect their child's privacy and how they are perceived, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are asserting their parental rights to control their child's image and are objecting to what they see as unnecessary alterations that could be inappropriate. The mother-in-law's actions, while perhaps trying to shield her friends, don't override the parent's authority in this context.\n"
