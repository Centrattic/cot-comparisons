Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and believes it's sexualizing the child, especially since the mother is doing this for Facebook and claims the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author told the mother not to post more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The child is a toddler, so her body is naturally uncensored. The mother is editing the photos, which the author finds problematic. The mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, implying that she thinks the unedited photos are not suitable. The author thinks the mother's action is sexualizing the child, while the mother might see it as covering up for appropriateness.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, generally, photos of children in diapers at home are considered acceptable, especially in private settings. The mother's act of covering the child's nipples might stem from a desire to make the photos more suitable for public Facebook, but the author feels that adding stickers is unnecessary and possibly inappropriate. The mother's friends seeing the edited photos might have different comfort levels, but the author has the right to object if they feel the mother's actions are crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to tell the mother not to post pictures is about protecting their child's privacy and how they want their family portrayed. The mother's action could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's making unilateral decisions about editing and sharing the child's photos without considering the parent's preferences. The author isn't wrong in asserting their boundaries here.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the stickers to imply that the child's body is something to be hidden or altered, which could be seen as infantilizing or adding unnecessary attention to the child's body in a way that's not age-appropriate. The author is advocating for their daughter's dignity and the way her images are shared.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting their child's privacy and objecting to what they see as an unnecessary and potentially inappropriate modification to the photos. The mother's actions might be well-intentioned, but the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's portrayal. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
