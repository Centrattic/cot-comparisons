Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The situation is that the mom posts a lot of the daughter's pictures on Facebook, and the grandmother edits them with stickers over the nipples. The author finds it creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's uncensored photos are also posted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is 17 months old, so a toddler. She's in a diaper in most photos, which means the photos are of her in a state of minimal clothing. The grandmother is covering the nipples with stickers, which the author sees as inappropriate and possibly sexualizing. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends to see. The author has told the grandmother not to post any more pictures of their daughter.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue here is about the appropriateness of covering a child's nipples in photos for social media. From a child safety perspective, sharing photos of a child on the internet can have long-term consequences, especially if they're in minimal clothing. The grandmother's action of adding stickers could be an attempt to make the photos more acceptable to her audience, but the author feels that even that is problematic.\n\nThe author's concern about sexualization is valid. Covering a child's nipples, especially when the same isn't done for male children, might imply a different standard and could be seen as drawing unnecessary attention to the child's body in a way that's inappropriate. The fact that the nephew's photos are uncensored and not altered might highlight the double standard here.\n\nHowever, the grandmother might have her own reasons for adding the stickers, possibly to comply with social norms or to avoid backlash from her friends. The author, as the parent, has the authority to decide what is appropriate for their child's privacy and image. By telling the grandmother not to post the photos at all, the author is asserting their parental rights to control their child's exposure online.\n\nIn terms of laws and societal norms, in many places, photographing and sharing images of children without clothing is generally acceptable as long as it's not explicit or intended for sexual purposes. However, the line can be blurry. The grandmother's editing could be seen as trying to make the photos more palatable, but the author's discomfort is valid, especially regarding potential sexualization.\n\nThe critical point here is the parent's right to make decisions about their child's privacy and image. The grandmother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are overriding the parent's wishes. The author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries with their mother regarding how their child is portrayed online. The answer likely hinges on the parent's right to control their child's image and the potential harm in altering the photos in a way that the parent finds inappropriate.\n"
