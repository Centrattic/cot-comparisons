Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The mother in question posts pictures of the toddler, who's often in a diaper, on Facebook. The grandmother edits the photos by adding stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author mentions that the same isn't done for their nephew, and when they confronted their mom, the mom said the photos were inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then told the mom not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 17 months, the daughter is an infant, and in many cultures, parents may dress their children in minimal clothing at home, especially toddlers who are toilet training. However, when posting photos online, there are considerations about privacy and appropriateness. The grandmother is adding stickers over the nipples, which the author finds problematic. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for objecting to this.\n\nThe author's concern is about the sexualization of their daughter. Covering nipples on a female child but not on a male cousin could imply a double standard, which might contribute to the author's discomfort. The grandmother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. But the line between what's acceptable for a child's photos is subjective. The author is asserting their right to control how their child is represented, especially on social media.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, it's illegal to distribute explicit images of minors, but a diaper is considered appropriate for a toddler. However, adding stickers over nipples might be seen as unnecessary and could be interpreted as drawing attention to the child's body in a way that's inappropriate. The author's decision to stop the grandmother from posting more pictures is a protective measure for their child.\n\nEthically, the grandmother's actions might be seen as contributing to the sexualization of the child, even if unintentionally. The author is rightly concerned about the implications of such edits. The mother's stance might stem from societal norms that view female bodies as needing to be covered, unlike male bodies. This could be a point of contention because it's not applied equally to the nephew.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding their child's representation. They have the right to protect their child's privacy and how she's perceived online. The grandmother's actions might be well-intentioned, but the author's perspective is valid. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
