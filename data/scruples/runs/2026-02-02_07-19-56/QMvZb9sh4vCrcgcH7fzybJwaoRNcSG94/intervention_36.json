Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos.\n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is 17 months old. The parents let her run around in a diaper at home, and the mother posts these photos on Facebook. The mother adds stickers over the baby's nipples, which the author finds creepy and inappropriate. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends. The author then tells the mother not to post any more pictures.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know others' opinions. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The central issue is the mother's decision to edit the photos with stickers over the nipples. The author is upset about this, finding it sexualizing. The mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author then bans the mother from posting the photos entirely.\n\nFirst, the legality: in the US, it's legal to take and share photos of minors in a private setting as long as there's no explicit sexual content. A diaper photo of a 17-month-old is generally considered acceptable. The mother's action of adding stickers might be her attempt to censor, but the author finds it problematic. \n\nThe author's stance is that the photos are not inappropriate, especially since the same applies to their nephew's photos which aren't censored. The mother's friends might be in a different age group or have different standards, but the author is the parent and has the right to decide about their child's privacy and image.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, the author has the authority to object to how their child's images are being shared, especially on social media. The mother's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, might be overstepping by altering the photos and possibly sexualizing the child, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe author's response (telling the mother not to post) is a reasonable boundary setting. They have the right to control the distribution of their child's images. The mother's justification about her friends' appropriateness might not override the parent's wishes.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for setting that boundary. The mother's actions could be seen as unnecessary and potentially harmful, and the author is right to address it. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
