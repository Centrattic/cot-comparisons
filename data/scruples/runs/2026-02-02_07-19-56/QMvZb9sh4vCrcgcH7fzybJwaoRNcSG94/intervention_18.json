Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault. The scenario involves the author's daughter, who's 17 months old, and the author's mother who is posting edited photos of the toddler on Facebook. The mother adds heart or smiley face stickers over the daughter's nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without covering the nipples, leading the author to tell her not to post any more pictures. The author wonders if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about the mother editing the photos to cover the child's nipples. The author is against this, feeling it's unnecessary and sexualizes the child. The mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author then tells the mother not to post any pictures, which might be seen as cutting off the mother's right to share photos, even if they're edited.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, there are laws about the depiction of minors. For example, in the US, federal law prohibits the depiction of nudity in the case of minors, but there might be exceptions for private settings. However, if the photos are edited to cover nipples, maybe the mother is trying to comply with what she perceives as appropriate for social media. But the author is concerned that the act of covering the nipples with stickers is itself inappropriate, possibly because it draws attention to the body part or makes it look like an adult might.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the mother may feel she has the right to share photos of her grandchild, but the parent (author) has the right to make decisions about their child's privacy and how they are represented. The author is asserting their right to control how their daughter is portrayed online. However, by telling the mother not to post any more pictures, the author might be overstepping if the mother's actions are within the bounds of what is legally or socially acceptable. The mother's edits could be her way of balancing her desire to share photos without violating community standards or her friends' expectations.\n\nAnother angle is the author's perception that the stickers are sexualizing the child. If the mother is covering the nipples because she thinks it's necessary for appropriateness, but the author sees the stickers as adding a sexual element, there's a conflict in perspectives. The author's stance is based on their discomfort with the stickers, but the mother's action is about making the photos acceptable to her audience.\n\nCulturally, there's a debate about infant and toddler nudity. Some cultures are more accepting of children being naked at home, while others are more conservative. The mother might be coming from a more conservative background where even a child's nipples are seen as inappropriate for public sharing. The parent (author) might be more progressive, valuing body positivity and the naturalness of children's bodies. This cultural difference could be causing the conflict.\n\nThe author's decision to stop the mother from posting any pictures might be seen as extreme. If the mother is editing the photos to comply with social norms or platform policies, the author could be preventing her from sharing the child's life in a way that's considered appropriate by the mother. However, the author's main concern is about the sexualization, which is a valid parental concern. The mother might not realize that the stickers could be interpreted as adding a sexual connotation, whereas she sees them as covering up the child for appropriateness.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has the right to set boundaries for their child's image. However, the approach of completely banning the mother from posting any photos might not be the best solution. A better approach might be discussing the concern about the stickers and finding a compromise, like not using stickers or only posting photos where the child is fully clothed. The author's immediate reaction to stop all postings could be seen as harsh, especially if the mother's edits are her way of trying to be appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. If the author is against the stickers, maybe the issue is about differing views on what's acceptable. The mother might think that without the stickers, the photos are too revealing for her social media audience, but the author believes the child has a right to be shown as she is. This is a clash between the grandmother's desire to share and the parent's desire to protect their child's image.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to tell the mother not to post any more pictures could be seen as overreacting because it cuts off the mother's ability to share, even if the method (stickers) is disputed. The author's main issue is the stickers, but the solution is to ban all photos, which might not be fair. The mother might have a right to share edited photos if she's doing so to comply with what she thinks is appropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing any photos, even if they disagree with the editing. Alternatively, the author's concern about sexualization is valid, but their approach is too extreme. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they are not allowing any photos, which might be more restrictive than necessary, but I need to check if their reasoning is valid.\n"
