Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting their mother to censor their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers. The mother is covering the child's nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing, especially since the child is in a diaper and the same photos of a nephew aren't censored. The author told their mother to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms here. In the U.S., there's generally no law against taking or sharing photos of children without clothing, especially toddlers. However, there are strict laws against distributing explicit images of minors, but this seems to be about casual family photos. The mother might be overstepping by adding stickers, which could imply a sexual intent, even if unintended. \n\nThe author's concern is valid because drawing attention to a child's body in such a way can be seen as inappropriate. The mother's justification is that the photos are \"inappropriate\" without the stickers, but that might be a way to impose her own standards. The author is setting boundaries about how their child is represented, which is a parent's right. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is the grandmother, and sometimes family members have differing views on privacy and child exposure. However, the act of editing photos to add stickers over a child's body could be problematic. The author's reaction to stop the postings is a reasonable way to enforce their boundaries, especially if they feel the photos are being sexualized. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting their child's photos altered in that way. They have the right to decide how their child is portrayed. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might not align with the author's comfort level. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
