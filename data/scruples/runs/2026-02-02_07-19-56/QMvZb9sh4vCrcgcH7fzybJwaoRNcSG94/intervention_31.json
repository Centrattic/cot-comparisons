Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so an infant. The mom lets her run around in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. The grandmother (the author's mom) posts photos on Facebook, editing in stickers over the baby's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same treatment isn't given to her nephew, and they've told the grandmother to stop posting. They're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and societal norms regarding child nudity. In many places, photos of children under a certain age, especially if they're in diapers and not in a sexual context, aren't considered explicit. However, societal standards can vary. The grandmother might be overstepping by adding stickers, which could be seen as adding a sexualized element. But the author's response is to tell the grandmother to stop posting any pictures of the daughter. That's a big step. The grandmother might feel her right to share family moments is being curtailed. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the stickers are creepy and sexualizing, which is a valid concern. However, the author is not allowing the grandmother to post any photos at all. There might be a middle ground, like discussing the content of the photos before posting or setting clearer boundaries. The grandmother might not realize the impact of her edits. \n\nBut the key point is the author's child's exposure. The grandmother is covering the baby's body in a way that could be seen as unnecessary, especially since other family photos of a male child are not edited. The author has a right to protect their child's image and ensure it's not sexualized. However, completely blocking all photos might be too extreme if the grandmother is just trying to share family moments. \n\nSo, the author's stance is about protecting their child, which is understandable. But their response is an absolute ban, which might not consider the grandmother's intent. The grandmother could be trying to be modest for her friends, but the method is problematic. The author might need to address the specific issue of the stickers rather than banning all photos. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be more nuanced. However, the core issue is the sexualization of the child, which is a valid concern. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
