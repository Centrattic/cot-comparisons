Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The context is that the daughter is 17 months old, often photographed in a diaper, and the mother is adding stickers over her nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. The mother argues the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, leading the author to tell her not to post more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 17 months, the child is a toddler, so her body is naturally developing, and the nipples aren't sexualized in any way. The mother's action of adding stickers might be an overreaction, possibly influenced by societal norms that sexualize female bodies from a young age. The author's discomfort is valid because there's no justification for covering a child's nipples in photos, especially when male relatives aren't censored similarly. \n\nThe mother's reasoning about appropriateness for friends might be a way to justify her actions, but it's important to recognize that a 17-month-old's body is not inappropriate. The author is advocating for their child's privacy and dignity, which is a parent's right. The mother's actions could be seen as unnecessary censorship, potentially causing the child to feel self-conscious later. \n\nThe key points here are the child's age, the lack of sexual context, and the mother's possible overstepping by adding stickers. The author's stance is to protect their child from being sexualized, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
