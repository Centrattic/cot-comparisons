Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault here. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and feels it's sexualizing the child, especially since the same treatment isn't given to the author's nephew. The author told their mother to stop posting the pictures, and now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is naturally uncensored. The mother is covering her nipples in photos, which the author finds inappropriate. The author's mother justifies it by saying her friends shouldn't see the photos without the stickers. The author is against this and has asked their mother to stop posting such pictures.\n\nNow, considering the laws and societal norms about children's privacy and censorship. In many places, it's considered normal for babies and toddlers to be naked in photos at home, especially when they're at home in diapers. Covering a child's natural body features in photos might be seen as unnecessary censorship, especially when boys' photos aren't treated the same way.\n\nThe mother's action of adding stickers could be an attempt to make the photos more acceptable for social media, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate. The author's objection is about the sexualization of a child, which is a valid concern. Covering the child's body in a way that draws attention to the nipples with stickers might be perceived as inappropriate, especially if it's done to avoid judgment from others, which could imply that the child's natural state is something to be hidden.\n\nThe author's decision to stop their mother from posting the photos is about protecting their child from potential sexualization and respecting the child's autonomy. The mother's argument that her friends need the stickers might be about her own comfort in social circles, which doesn't override the parent's responsibility to protect their child's image.\n\nAlso, the fact that the nephew's photos aren't censored suggests a double standard. This inconsistency might highlight that the mother's actions are based on unnecessary modesty or societal pressures rather than a genuine concern for the child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, there are laws against the sexualization of children, so using stickers to draw attention to the nipples could be problematic. The author is within their rights to object to this and to set boundaries about how their child is portrayed online.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are standing up against actions that could potentially harm their child's image and preventing unnecessary sexualization. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might be projecting adult concerns onto the child. The answer should be B.\n"
