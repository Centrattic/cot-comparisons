Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The situation involves a 17-month-old who often isn't dressed, leading to photos where the mother's mom adds stickers over the nipples.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around photographing and sharing images of children. In many places, it's legal to take photos of children in the home, especially when they're in diapers, as they're not dressed for social media. However, covering the nipples with stickers might be the grandmother's way of adhering to her own comfort or social media guidelines. But the author finds this sexualizing, which is a valid concern because the child's body parts aren't different from male counterparts, and the stickers might imply a sexual context where there isn't one.\n\nNext, the mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then tells her not to post any more pictures. The key here is whether the author overstepped by banning all photos or if there's a middle ground. However, the author is the parent, so they have the right to set boundaries regarding their child's privacy and how they're represented online.\n\nThe grandmother's actions could also be a matter of her own values versus the parents'. The author isn't wrong to express discomfort with the censorship implying something inappropriate. The child's nudity in photos is a common issue, with some parents allowing it for home use but not for public sharing. The author's stance on not wanting the photos to be altered in a way that sexualizes their daughter is reasonable. \n\nLegally, there's no law against covering body parts in photos, but the act of censoring might not be necessary. The author's request to stop posting photos entirely could be a reaction to the specific issue of censorship rather than the photos themselves. It's possible the grandmother was overreacting by adding stickers, and the author's response, while firm, is within their rights as a parent.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding their child's image and the way it's edited. The grandmother's actions might stem from her own discomfort or social norms, but the parent has the authority to decide how their child is portrayed publicly.\n"
