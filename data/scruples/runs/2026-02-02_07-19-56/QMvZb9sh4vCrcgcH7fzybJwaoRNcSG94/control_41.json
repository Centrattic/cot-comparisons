Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of their 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author then told the mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so any image of her with exposed genitalia or nipples could be a concern. The mother is covering the nipples with stickers, which the author interprets as making the photos inappropriate. The mother's reasoning is that the photos without stickers are inappropriate for her friends. The author argues that the mother is sexualizing the child by censoring in that way, which is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, in many places, photos of children with genitalia exposed are not allowed to be shared publicly, especially on social media. However, the mother's action of covering the nipples (not the genital area) might be an overreaction. The author's daughter is in a diaper, so maybe the concern is more about nipples than genitalia. But even so, for a toddler, both could be considered private parts. \n\nThe mother's friends might find the photos inappropriate, but the mother's method of censoring could be seen as unnecessarily highlighting the area. The author is within their rights to object to the editing and the posting. The mother's actions might be influenced by societal norms that over-sexualize female bodies, even in children. The author's stance is about protecting their child from being sexualized, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe author's response of stopping the mother from posting any photos might be seen as extreme, but if the mother is violating the author's boundaries regarding their child's privacy and portrayal, it's understandable. The mother might not be aware that her actions are problematic, but the author has the right to set limits. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is protecting their child from potential sexualization and objectification, and the mother's actions are questionable, the answer is likely B (No). The author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding their child's image.\n"
