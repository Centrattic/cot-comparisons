Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother editing photos of the author's 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author told the mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and societal norms around photographing and sharing images of children. In many places, there are laws against distributing explicit images of minors, but this is about a diaper-clad toddler. However, the key issue here is the mother covering the nipples with stickers, implying that the unedited photos might be problematic. The author's mother argues that the unedited photos are inappropriate for her friends, but the author finds the stickers themselves problematic.\n\nFrom a parental rights perspective, the author has the authority over how their child is portrayed. The mother, as a relative, might have a different view on what's appropriate for social media. The author's stance is that the child's body parts should not be censored in a way that implies they are sexual, especially since a boy of similar age isn't censored. This could be seen as the author defending their child's autonomy and the normalcy of their body.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to tell the mother not to post any pictures at all. The mother might feel this is an overreaction if she believed the stickers were necessary for her audience. The author's demand might not consider the mother's perspective on appropriateness for her social circle.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of censoring the child's body with stickers while not doing the same for a male child could be seen as sexualizing the female child unnecessarily. The author is right to object to that. But by refusing all photos, they might be dismissing the mother's intent to share while also respecting privacy. The author might have a valid point but perhaps could have addressed it differently, like discussing alternatives to stickers or adjusting the audience.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's main issue is valid, but their response might be too absolute. However, the mother's actions were the initial problem. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's response was proportionate. Since the author is protecting their child from unwanted sexualization, they might not be in the wrong. The stickers themselves are the problem, so the author's stance is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
