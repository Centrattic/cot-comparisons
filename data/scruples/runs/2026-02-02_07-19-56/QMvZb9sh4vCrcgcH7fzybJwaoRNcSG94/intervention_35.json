Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The mom is a grandparent who posts lots of pictures online, and she adds stickers to cover the daughter's nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, but the mom says it's because the photos are inappropriate for her friends without covering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. The daughter is 17 months old, so under two. In the US, it's generally legal to photograph children in a state of undress at home, especially for family photos. However, the mom is editing the photos to add stickers, which the author objects to. The key issue here is whether the author has the right to tell their mom not to post these edited photos.\n\nThe author's argument is that the mom is making the photos seem sexual by covering the daughter's nipples with stickers, which the author perceives as inappropriate. The mom's reasoning is that her friends might find the photos inappropriate without the stickers. So there's a conflict between the parent's wishes and the grandparent's actions.\n\nIn terms of rights, the parent is the legal guardian and has the authority to decide what's appropriate for their child's images. The grandparent, while well-meaning, might be overstepping by editing and posting the photos in a way the parent disagrees with. However, the parent might have let the mom post the photos initially, but now the parent is objecting to the editing part.\n\nLegally, the parent can control what's published of their child. The grandparent could be within her rights to post the photos as taken, but adding stickers to modify them might be crossing a line if the parent objects. However, since it's a grandparent, there might be cultural or family norms that complicate this.\n\nEthically, the parent's decision should be respected. If the parent doesn't want the daughter's body parts altered in photos for public sharing, the grandparent should comply. The parent is the one responsible for the child's well-being and has the final say in such matters. The mom's action of adding stickers could be seen as imposing her own views on appropriateness over the parent's wishes.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for asking their mom to stop posting the edited photos. The parent has the right to decide how their child's images are presented, especially regarding privacy and appropriateness in public forums. Therefore, the answer would be B for No.\n"
