Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom whose daughter is 17 months old and mostly wears a diaper at home. The mother-in-law (the author's mom) posts pictures of the daughter on Facebook, covering the nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's photos are uncensored. The author told her mom to stop posting the pictures, and now they're wondering if they're the one in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, so her body is naturally not sexualized. The mother is concerned that covering the nipples with stickers is inappropriate and might sexualize her child. The mother-in-law argues that the pictures are inappropriate without the stickers, implying her friends might not see them otherwise. \n\nIn terms of legality, in many places, it's about whether the content is considered obscenity. Since the child is under two, the photos might not even be classified as inappropriate. But the bigger issue is consent and the parent's right to make decisions about their child's exposure to social media. The mother-in-law is making the decision to edit the photos and post them, which the author objects to. The author then tells her not to post anymore. \n\nThe mother's discomfort is valid because intentionally covering a child's private parts with stickers could be seen as unnecessary and might imply an attempt to draw attention to those areas, which could be problematic. On the other hand, the mother-in-law might have cultural or personal reasons for covering them, thinking it's more appropriate for public sharing. \n\nHowever, the author is the parent of the child, so their right to decide what's appropriate for their child should take precedence. Even if the mother-in-law has her reasons, the parent should have the final say. The author isn't just objecting to the stickers but to the entire posting of the photos, which is their prerogative as the parent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to protect their child from what they deem inappropriate sharing, especially when it involves their own parenting choices. The mother-in-law might be overstepping by posting and editing the photos without consulting the parent properly. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
