Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in family photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so she's a toddler. The mom posts a lot of photos on Facebook, but she adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos aren't censored. They told their mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is concerned about their daughter's privacy and the potential for inappropriate sexualization. The mother, on the other hand, might feel that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. \n\nThe daughter is a minor, so the parents have a duty to protect her best interests. However, the mother is an adult's parent and might have her own views on what's appropriate. The key issue here is whether covering the nipples with stickers is necessary or if it's adding unnecessary emphasis that could be seen as sexual. The author's nephew isn't censored the same way, which might indicate a possible double standard based on gender. \n\nAlso, the author has asked their mom to stop posting the photos after discussing it. The question is whether the author is wrong for setting that boundary. From a child's welfare perspective, it's reasonable to want to avoid any content that could be seen as objectifying or inappropriate. The mother's friends might be exposed to content that parents might not want, even if the intention is to 'protect' by adding stickers. \n\nThere's a difference between normal toddler nudity (like in a diaper) and adding elements that could be seen as sexualizing. The stickers might be the issue here. The author's discomfort is valid, especially if the same isn't done for a male child. The mother's reasoning about appropriateness for friends might be her own concern, but the child's dignity and privacy should take precedence. \n\nSo, the author is standing up for their child's rights and expressing discomfort with the added elements. They're not wrong to set boundaries, especially since the photos are being shared publicly. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
