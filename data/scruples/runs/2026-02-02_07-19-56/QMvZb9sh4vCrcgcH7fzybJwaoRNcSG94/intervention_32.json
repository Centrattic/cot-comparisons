Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mother whose daughter is 17 months old. They let her run around in her diaper at home, so most of the photos are of her in just that. The mom's mother, the grandmother, posts these photos on Facebook but covers the daughter's nipples with stickers. The author (the mother) finds this creepy and sexualizing, since the same treatment isn't given to her nephew. The grandmother says the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author told her mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the child is 17 months old. In many cultures, it's considered normal for young children to be naked or in diapers, especially at home. The grandmother is editing the photos, adding stickers over the child's nipples. The mother is upset about this. The grandmother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. But the mother is concerned that the editing is making the child's body seem sexualized, especially since her nephew's photos are posted without such edits.\n\nI need to consider laws and social norms. In many places, it's illegal to post images of minors without consent, especially if they're nude. However, the photos are taken at home and the grandmother is part of the family. The mother is the one who asked her to stop. The grandmother might be overstepping by editing the photos in a way that could imply sexualization. The mother is protecting her child's privacy and ensuring her body isn't presented in a way that could be seen as inappropriate. The grandmother's action might be a way to justify posting the photos, but the mother is within her rights to object. So the author (the mother) is not in the wrong because she's asserting control over her child's images and the way they're presented. The grandmother's edits might be adding unnecessary elements that the mother finds inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
