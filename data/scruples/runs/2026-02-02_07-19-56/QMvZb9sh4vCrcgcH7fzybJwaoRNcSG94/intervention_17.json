Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of the 17-month-old daughter with stickers over her nipples when posting on Facebook. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, comparing it to their nephew's uncensored photos, and told their mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and societal norms around child nudity in photos. In many places, it's legal to have photos of children in the bath or diaper, especially at that age, as they're considered innocent and not sexualized. The mother's action of adding stickers might be an overreaction, possibly indicating discomfort with the natural appearance of the child's body or a misguided attempt to protect the audience from something she perceives as inappropriate. However, by adding those stickers, she might indeed be inadvertently drawing attention to the body parts, which could be seen as sexualizing them more than necessary.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting their child from being sexualized, which is a valid concern. The mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, suggesting she's trying to make them more acceptable for her friends. But if the original photos are of a toddler in a diaper, which is a common and innocent scenario, then the stickers could be making the photos more questionable. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding how their child is portrayed publicly. The mother's edits might not align with the author's values, especially since the child's body parts are normal and not different from a male child's. The author's decision to ask their mom to stop posting the pictures is about protecting their child's autonomy and privacy. \n\nHowever, the author's response might be seen as abrupt if the mother felt her intentions were good. But given the potential for the stickers to be perceived as sexualizing the child, the author's objection is justified. The key here is whether the author had the right to object and set limits on how their child's images are shared. Since the mother was posting on her own Facebook, it's possible she thought she had the right, but the author as the parent has the authority to decide what's appropriate for their child's portrayal. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author is not in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The mother might have overstepped by editing the photos in a way that the author finds inappropriate. The author's actions are about protecting their child's image and preventing any potential misuse or misinterpretation. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
