Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a mom whose daughter is 17 months old. The daughter often wears just a diaper, and the author's mother (the grandma) posts photos of the kid on Facebook. But the grandma is covering the child's nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author told the grandma not to post more pictures, and now they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author is the parent, so they have the right to make decisions about their child's privacy and how their images are shared. The grandma is a relative, but she's not the parent. The parent's authority usually takes precedence in such matters. The author is concerned that covering the child's nipples is inappropriate, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. That suggests there's a double standard, which could imply sexualization.\n\nOn the other hand, the grandma might be trying to make the photos more acceptable for her friends, thinking that showing the nipples is inappropriate. But the parent's perspective is that the child is just a baby, and there's no need to censor her. The author is standing up for their child's image and autonomy, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping by telling the grandma not to post any pictures? The grandma might have a right to share family photos, unless there's a specific reason not to. However, the parent is the one responsible for the child's welfare, so they do have the authority to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure online. The issue here is whether the censorship itself is wrong. The author is against it, and as the parent, they should have the final say in how their child is represented. \n\nSo the author is acting to protect their child from what they see as unnecessary sexualization. The grandma's action of covering the nipples could be seen as infantilizing or drawing attention to the child's body in a way that's not appropriate. The parent is correct in pointing out that the nephew's photos aren't censored, which highlights the inconsistency. Therefore, the author is justified in their stance. The answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. So the choice is B.\n"
