Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom editing their 17-month-old daughter's photos by covering her nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mom argues that the pictures are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends to see. The author then told the mom not to post any more pictures of their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the mom's actions and the author's response. The daughter is an infant, so the issue is about photographing a child in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. But the mom is editing the photos to cover the nipples, which the author objects to. The author's concern is that this makes the photos sexualized, especially since male relatives aren't censored in the same way. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nIn terms of legal and societal norms, there are guidelines about photographing children. Generally, photos of children in the bathtub or diaper are considered acceptable for family sharing, but when posted publicly, especially with alterations that could be seen as sexualizing, it might be a problem. The mom's action of adding stickers to cover the nipples could be seen as unnecessary and potentially contributing to a sexualized image, which the author rightly finds concerning.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the mom not to post any more pictures. This is their right as a parent to decide what is appropriate for their child's privacy and image. The mom's justification that her friends wouldn't see the unedited photos is not a strong argument, as the author is now objecting to the edits. The key here is parental discretion and the right to control the portrayal of their child. The author is standing up for their child's image and privacy, which is a valid stance.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is acting in their child's best interest by objecting to what they see as inappropriate edits and setting boundaries on their mother's posting behavior.\n"
