Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's daughter is 17 months old, and she often wears just a diaper. The mother (the author's mom) posts these pictures on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing the child, especially since other kids (like the nephew) aren't censored in the same way. The author told the mom to stop posting the pictures entirely. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms here. In many places, public indecency laws apply to adults, but children are not considered in the same way. However, posting images of a child in minimal clothing could be seen as inappropriate, depending on the context and the intent. The author's mom is adding stickers, which might be an attempt to make the images more acceptable to her audience, but the author perceives this as unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the stickers are making the images sexualized. The mom argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The author, however, is concerned about the sexualizing aspect. The key points here are the mother's intent (to cover the child for appropriateness) versus the author's concern about the effect of the stickers.\n\nFrom a child protection standpoint, sexualizing children is generally considered harmful. Even if the intent isn't sexual, adding stickers over a child's nipples could be seen as drawing unnecessary attention to their body parts, which might be inappropriate. The author is acting to protect their daughter from this potential harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that the photos are just for family and friends, and the stickers are a way to make them more suitable. However, the author is the parent, and they have the right to set boundaries regarding their child's privacy and image.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the mother not to post any more pictures. That's a firm stance, but it's within their rights as a parent to decide how their child is portrayed. The mother might feel that she's being denied the chance to share her granddaughter's photos, but the author's priority is the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are standing up against what they perceive as inappropriate treatment of their child's image. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, may inadvertently contribute to sexualization, which the author is rightly concerned about. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
