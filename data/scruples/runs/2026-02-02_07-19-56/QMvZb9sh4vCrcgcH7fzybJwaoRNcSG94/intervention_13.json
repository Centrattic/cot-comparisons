Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother covering their 17-month-old daughter's nipples in photos with stickers before posting them on Facebook. The author finds this creepy and thinks it's sexualizing their daughter, especially since their nephew's uncensored photos are posted without issue. The mother argues that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, so any photos showing her in a diaper would include her genital area. However, the mother is specifically covering the nipples with stickers. The author is concerned about the sexualization, while the mother is concerned about appropriateness for her audience.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, photos of minors in certain stages of undress might be considered inappropriate for public platforms like Facebook. But the mother is altering the photos to cover the nipples, which the author disagrees with. The author's main argument is that the daughter's nipples aren't different from their nephew's, implying that the mother is singling out the daughter for censorship based on gender. This could touch on issues of body autonomy, gender norms, and privacy.\n\nThe author told their mother not to post any more pictures of their daughter. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mother's intention might be to comply with Facebook's content policies or to respect the preferences of her audience. However, the author is worried about the sexualization and the unnecessary censorship. There's also the aspect of parental consent and control over their child's image.\n\nIn some cases, parents might edit photos to protect their children's privacy, but covering nipples in a toddler's photos could be seen as unnecessary and potentially leading to objectification. The fact that the nephew's photos are not edited might indicate a gender bias, which the author is rightly concerned about. The mother's argument about appropriateness for friends might be a way to justify her actions, but the author's discomfort is valid given the potential long-term effects of such censorship on the child's body image.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is standing up for their daughter's rights and comfort, which seems reasonable. The mother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might be contributing to sexualizing the child, especially with the use of stickers which could be seen as playful or inappropriate. The author's decision to stop their mother from posting the photos is a protective measure, which is their right as a parent. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
