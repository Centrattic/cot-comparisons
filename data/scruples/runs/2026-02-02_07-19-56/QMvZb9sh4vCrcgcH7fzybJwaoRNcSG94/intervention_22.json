Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mother whose daughter's photos are being posted by the grandmother on Facebook. The grandmother adds stickers over the daughter's nipples, which the mother finds creepy and sexualizing. The grandmother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers. The mother then tells her mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around posting children's photos. In many places, it's illegal to publish explicit images of minors. However, a diapered child's image might fall into a gray area. The grandmother is covering the nipples with stickers, which the mother objects to. The mother is concerned about the sexualization, while the grandmother is trying to make the photos appropriate for her friends.\n\nThe key points here are consent and appropriateness. The daughter is a minor, so the mother is the legal guardian. The grandmother is acting without the daughter's consent. The mother has the right to decide what's appropriate for her child's privacy. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, but the mother's response of stopping all posts might be too harsh. The mother could have requested the grandmother to stop using stickers instead of banning all posts. However, the mother has the right to set boundaries regarding her child's privacy. The grandmother's reasoning about appropriateness for friends might be her justification, but the mother's discomfort is valid. The situation might be a conflict of perspectives: the grandmother views the stickers as necessary for appropriateness, while the mother sees them as unnecessary and inappropriate. The mother's decision to stop all posts is a boundary she's setting, which is her right. So, the author (mother) isn't in the wrong because she's protecting her child's privacy and objecting to what she perceives as inappropriate. The grandmother might be in the wrong for not respecting the mother's wishes once they were expressed. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
