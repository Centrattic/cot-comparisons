Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother (the author) not wanting her own mother to cover her 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers. The grandmother is posting these edited photos on Facebook, covering the baby's nipples with hearts or smiley faces.\n\nThe author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos aren't censored. The grandmother argues that the photos without the stickers are inappropriate for her friends. The author then tells her mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, consider the legal and social norms around children's photos. In many places, it's standard to avoid posting children in the nude or semi-nude for privacy and safety. However, the grandmother's action of adding stickers might be an attempt to make the photos more acceptable for social media, which often has community guidelines against nudity. \n\nThe author's stance is about not wanting the daughter to be sexualized. However, the daughter is a toddler, and her body is not sexualized. The grandmother's edits might be unnecessary and could imply that the natural state is being hidden, which could be seen as problematic. But the author is now restricting all photos of the child, which might be overreacting if the grandmother's intention was just to comply with Facebook's rules. \n\nBut the key point is the child's best interest. The author has the right to decide how their child is represented. If the grandmother is editing the photos in a way the author finds inappropriate, the author has the right to ask her to stop. However, the author is also blocking all photos, which might be an overreaction if some photos aren't edited. \n\nAlso, considering the grandmother covers the nephew's photos without edits, there's inconsistency. The author's objection is valid because the child's body shouldn't be altered in a way that could imply sexualization. The grandmother's justification about friends seeing inappropriate content is her concern, not the child's. \n\nSo the author is within their rights to request the grandmother stops. The grandmother's edits could be seen as adding an unnecessary layer of sexualization. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
