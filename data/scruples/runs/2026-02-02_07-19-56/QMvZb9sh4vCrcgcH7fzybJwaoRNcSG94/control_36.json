Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 17 months old, so an infant. The mom (the author's mother) is posting photos of the author's daughter on Facebook, but in those photos, the baby is in a diaper and the mother is covering the baby's nipples with heart or smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the baby is just a toddler and the same treatment isn't given to the author's nephew. When they confronted their mom, the mom said the pictures were inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then told their mom not to post any more pictures of their daughter.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong here?\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author is the parent of the child, right? Wait, wait. Wait, the author is the daughter of the person whose mother is posting the pictures. Wait, no. Wait, the author's daughter is the 17-month-old. So the author is the parent of the child. The author's mother (the grandmother) is posting photos of her granddaughter. So the author is the parent trying to control what their own parent is doing with photos of their child.\n\nThe grandmother is covering the baby's nipples in the photos. The author thinks this is inappropriate because it's sexualizing the baby. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author is telling the grandmother not to post the photos.\n\nSo the author is saying they don't want their daughter's nipples covered in the photos. They think the grandmother is making it look sexual. The grandmother, however, is covering them, perhaps out of propriety or because her friends expect it. But the author is upset that the grandmother is doing that, and then the grandmother is also not allowed to post photos anymore.\n\nIs the author wrong in this situation? Well, the author is the parent, so they have the final say in what happens to their child's images. The grandmother is a parent too, but in this case, she's the grandparent. The author is the legal guardian, so they can set boundaries. The grandmother's actions might be based on her own beliefs or the preferences of her social circle, but the author is the one who has to make decisions for their child's privacy and image.\n\nThe key issue here is whether covering a 17-month-old's nipples in photos is necessary or appropriate. In many contexts, images of children in diapers without clothing are common, like in baby photos, and it's generally accepted. Covering the nipples with stickers might be seen as unnecessary, especially since the child is not aware of their body in that way yet. The grandmother's action might be adding a layer that's not needed, possibly making the photos seem more sexual than they naturally would be. The author is correct in feeling that this is inappropriate, as the child is just an infant.\n\nAdditionally, the grandmother's reasoning that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers is a bit conflicting. If the photos of the nephew (a boy) aren't censored, then why censor the girl? It seems like a double standard. The author is standing up for their child's dignity and how their photos are presented. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decide how their child's images are shared, especially if they feel the grandmother's actions are inappropriate. The grandmother overstepped by adding the stickers, and the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n"
