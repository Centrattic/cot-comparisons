Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother editing photos of their 17-month-old daughter by covering her nipples with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author told her not to post any more pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The child is very young, and the author is okay with the child being in a diaper in photos but not with the stickers over the nipples. The mother is doing this to make the photos appropriate for her Facebook friends. The author's main issue is that the stickers are making the child's image sexualized, especially since male relatives' photos are posted without such edits. \n\nI should think about the legal and social norms. Legally, in many places, it's acceptable to post photos of children in swimsuits or diapers as long as they're not in explicit content. However, adding stickers might be a way to make the photos more palatable to a general audience, but the author sees it as unnecessary and inappropriate. \n\nThe mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, but the author doesn't agree. The author is trying to protect their child from being sexualized. The mother might be projecting her own boundaries onto the situation, thinking her friends might find the child's natural features inappropriate. The author, however, is more concerned about the message the stickers send and the implication of sexualization. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? The author is the parent, so they have the right to decide what's appropriate for their child's exposure. The mother's edits might be crossing a line by adding elements that the author finds problematic. The author's response to stop all postings might be a strong move, but the core issue is about consent and the parent's authority over their child's image. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their child from unnecessary sexualization. The mother's stickers could be seen as adding something that the author doesn't want associated with their child. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
