Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault (\"AITA?\") regarding their mother's editing of their daughter's photos.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is 17 months old, often in a diaper at home, and the mother posts photos on Facebook. The mother adds stickers over the daughter's nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, unlike photos of the nephew. The author then asks the mother to stop posting the pictures.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nStart by considering the age of the child. At 17 months, it's natural for a child to be in a diaper and not dressed in more clothing at home. The author is not covering the daughter, which is typical for such a young child. The mother is adding stickers to the photos, which the author finds problematic. The mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. However, the nephew's photos (assuming he's also a young child) aren't censored, which highlights inconsistency.\n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of the photos and the mother's actions. The parent (author) has the right to control how their child is portrayed publicly, especially on social media. The mother's edits could be seen as unnecessary and possibly objectifying, as the author points out. The fact that the mother is altering the photos to cover the daughter's natural body parts, while not doing the same for the nephew, suggests a double standard that might stem from gender bias. The author's decision to ask the mother to stop posting the pictures is a reasonable exercise of their parental rights to protect their child's privacy and how their images are used.\n\nIt's important to note that laws vary by region, but generally, parents have the authority to make decisions regarding their children's privacy. The mother's actions might be crossing a line by adding elements that could be perceived as sexualizing the child, even if her intention is to make the photos more \"appropriate.\" The author's discomfort is valid, and their response is a reasonable boundary-setting action.\n"
