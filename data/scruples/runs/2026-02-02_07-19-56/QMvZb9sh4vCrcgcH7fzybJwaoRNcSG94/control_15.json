Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, and the mom takes pictures of her in a diaper, which is common for toddlers. The grandmother then posts these photos on Facebook but covers the nipples with stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the author's nephew. They told the mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 17 months, she's a toddler, and it's normal for them to be naked or in diapers at home. Parents often take such photos as part of documenting their child's growth. However, the issue arises with the grandmother's editing\u2014adding stickers over the nipples. The author feels this is inappropriate, possibly because it's unnecessary censorship that draws attention to the body parts, which might imply a sexual context. \n\nThe grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. But the author points out that the nephew's photos aren't censored similarly. This inconsistency might be a key point. The author's stance is about protecting their daughter's privacy and how the photos are perceived. They might feel that the stickers are unnecessary and could be seen as sexualizing their daughter, especially when not applied to boys.\n\nLegal aspects vary by country, but in many places, photos of children in such a state are generally acceptable if they're taken in private settings and not for distribution with the intent to sexualize. The grandmother's actions could be seen as adding an element that isn't necessary and might change the perception of the photos. The author's decision to ask the mom to stop posting is about controlling their child's exposure and how others view her.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They have the right to decide how their child's images are shared. Their concern is valid, especially given the difference in treatment between their daughter and nephew. The grandmother's argument about friends seeing \"inappropriate\" content seems subjective. The author's response is reasonable to protect their child's dignity and privacy. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
