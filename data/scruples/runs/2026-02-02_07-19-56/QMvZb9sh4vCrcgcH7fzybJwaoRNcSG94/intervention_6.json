To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their mom covering their toddler's chest in photos.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17 months old, so an infant. The parents let her run around in a diaper at home, which is common for toddlers. The mother posts pictures on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar uncensored photos are posted without issue.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and appropriateness. The parents are the ones making decisions for their child. The mother is the one posting the photos and editing them. The author is objecting to the censorship of their child's body in those photos. \n\nThe mother's reasoning is that the pictures are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends. But the author feels that censoring the nipples is adding something unnecessary and possibly inappropriate. \n\nIn the US, there are no strict laws against posting photos of minors without clothing, as long as it's not considered obscene. However, there's a societal norm around children's bodies and modesty. The mother's action of adding stickers might be an attempt to make the photos more acceptable to her audience. \n\nBut why would the author feel the need to stop their mother from posting entirely? The author could have asked her to stop adding the stickers instead of halting all posts. By telling her not to post any more pictures, the author might be overreacting to the censorship aspect rather than the actual content. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the stickers being sexualizing could be valid. Adding anything to a child's body in photos can be seen as giving undue attention to that area. The fact that the nephew's photos aren't censored supports the idea that the mother's actions might be gender-biased or unnecessary.\n\nSo, the author's stance might be justified in wanting to protect their child's image from being altered in a way they find inappropriate. However, the approach of stopping all posts could be too extreme. The mother might have the right to share family photos, even if edited, unless it's harmful. The author's decision to halt all posts could be seen as overstepping, especially if the mother is acting in good faith, even if the author disagrees with her method.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention to prevent the stickers is understandable, but their solution of stopping all posts might be where they are in the wrong. The correct action would be to address the stickers specifically rather than banning all photos. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong for objecting to the stickers, but their solution might be questionable). Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is objecting to the stickers, that's not wrong, but telling the mother not to post any more photos could be. However, the mother is the one making the photos public, so the author has the right to set boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the initial answer the user thinks is A (the author is in the wrong). Hmm. Let me check again.\n\nThe author's problem is the stickers, which they find creepy and sexualizing. The mother's justification is that the photos are inappropriate without them, implying that without the stickers, others might find the photos inappropriate. However, in reality, a child's body in a diaper is generally considered acceptable. The mother's action of adding the stickers might be creating an issue where there isn't one. The author is standing up for their child's right not to have their body altered in photos in a way that the parent finds uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to stop the stickers, and their decision to stop the mother from posting might be a boundary they feel necessary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
