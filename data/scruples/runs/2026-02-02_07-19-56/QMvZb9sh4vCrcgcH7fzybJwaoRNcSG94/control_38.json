Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The mom is posting pictures of the toddler in a diaper, which is common for such a young child. The mother adds stickers over the nipples, and the author finds that creepy and sexualizing. The mother's reasoning is that the images are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. A 17-month-old in a diaper is not typically being sexualized. The stickers might be an unnecessary addition. The author's concern about the stickers making it sexualized seems valid because a small child's body should not be altered in a way that could be perceived as such. The mother's argument is about appropriateness for friends, but maybe the underlying issue is about modesty or societal norms. However, in many cultures, images of young children without clothing are common and not considered inappropriate, especially in family settings.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child and the mother's intent to cover the nipples with stickers. The author is standing up for their child's dignity and avoiding potential sexualization. The mother's action might be based on her own discomfort or the expectation of her social circle, but that doesn't necessarily justify adding stickers that could be seen as unnecessary or even as a form of censorship or oversexualization. The author's decision to ask their mother to stop posting the photos is a protective measure. \n\nI need to check if there's any cultural context I'm missing. In some cultures, even young children's bodies are covered more, but the author is already allowing their daughter to be in a diaper, which is less clothing. The stickers add a layer that isn't there for a boy (the nephew), which highlights the issue of gender bias or unnecessary censorship. The author is not in the wrong for objecting to this. Their stance is about protecting their child from being sexualized, which is a valid concern regardless of the mother's reasoning. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
