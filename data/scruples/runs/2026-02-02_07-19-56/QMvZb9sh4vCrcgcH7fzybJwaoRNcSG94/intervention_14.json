Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The main issue is the mother (the author's mom) adding stickers over the child's nipples and the author finding that creepy and sexualizing. The author then told their mom not to post any more pictures of the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around this. In many places, there are laws about the depiction of minors in explicit content, but a diaper-clad toddler's body, including nipples, is generally considered acceptable, especially if the child is under two and the photos are not sexualized. The author is concerned that the stickers are adding a sexual element where there isn't one naturally. The mother's friends might find the photos inappropriate without the stickers, but the author disagrees.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the intent behind the editing. The grandmother is editing the photos, possibly without considering the boundaries set by the parent. The author is protecting their child from potential sexualization, which is a common concern in parenting. The mother's rationale is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends, but the author's stance is about preventing the child from being sexualized, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nThere's also the aspect of parental authority. The author is the parent, and they have the right to set boundaries on how their child is portrayed, especially in public forums. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping if the parent has clearly communicated their discomfort. However, the stickers themselves might be trying to protect the child's image, but the method is problematic because it's adding elements that could be perceived as sexualizing the child.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal precedent here. In some jurisdictions, even if the photo is innocent, altering it in a way that adds suggestive elements could be problematic. However, without specific laws cited, it's more about social norms and parental rights. The author's action to stop the posts is a boundary they're setting as a parent, which should be respected. The mother's friends' comfort level isn't the priority; the child's well-being and the parent's wishes are.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to be concerned about their child's image being altered in a potentially sexualizing way. The mother's actions are crossing a line by modifying the photos without considering the parent's objections. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
