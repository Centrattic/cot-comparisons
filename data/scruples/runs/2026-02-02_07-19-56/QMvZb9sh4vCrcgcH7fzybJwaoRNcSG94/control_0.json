To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation. The author's daughter is 17 months old, and they let her be in a diaper at home, which is pretty common for toddlers. The mom (the author's mother) posts a lot of photos of the granddaughter on Facebook. The issue is that the grandmother is covering the child's nipples with stickers like hearts or smiley faces. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same treatment isn't given to the nephew's photos. The grandmother says the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, so the author told her not to post anymore. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grandmother's perspective. She might think that posting photos of a child in a diaper without covering the nipples is inappropriate for her friends, maybe out of concern for modesty or societal norms. She might be trying to avoid any potential backlash or discomfort from her social circle. However, the author's issue is that covering the nipples is unnecessary and even problematic because it adds a sexualized element that isn't there. The grandmother's action could be seen as overstepping, especially since she's altering the photos without the parents' consent beyond a certain point.\n\nFrom the author's side, they are protecting their child's privacy and dignity. Covering a child's nipples with stickers could be seen as unnecessary and possibly contributing to the sexualization of children. The fact that the nephew's photos aren't treated the same way might indicate a bias or double standard. The author has the right to set boundaries for their child's image, especially on public platforms like Facebook.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations come into play. In many places, photos of children in the nude or with partial nudity are allowed if they're in a private setting and for family sharing, but public posting can be contentious. The grandmother's actions might be well-intentioned, but they could cross into overstepping by altering the photos. The key here is consent. The parents have the authority to decide how their child's image is used, so the grandmother should have discussed this with the author before posting and certainly before editing the photos.\n\nThe author's response to stop all postings might seem extreme, but given their concern, it's a way to enforce their boundaries. It's possible that a compromise could be found, like not posting the photos at all or only sharing them within a private group. However, the author's stance is valid in protecting their child from any potential exploitation or unwanted attention, even if the grandmother's intent was different.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement to normalize children's bodies and not to cover them unnecessarily. Covering a child's nipples with stickers could be seen as adding a decorative element that adults find amusing but isn't appropriate for the child. The author's discomfort is justified, and their reaction is a way to protect their child's image and prevent any misinterpretation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The grandmother's actions are problematic, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
