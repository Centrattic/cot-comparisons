Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their mom covering their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author tells the mom not to post any more pictures of the daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 17-month-old is a toddler, and it's common for young children to be naked or in diapers at home. Parents often take such photos as part of everyday life. However, when it comes to posting online, there might be different norms.\n\nThe mom is using stickers to cover the daughter's nipples. The author compares this to their nephew's uncensored photos, implying that the mom isn't doing the same for a boy. That seems like the root of the issue. The author feels that adding those stickers is inappropriate and maybe even objectifying the child. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers, which might relate to societal norms about nudity, especially female nudity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their mom to stop posting the photos. The author is the parent, so they have the right to make decisions about their child's privacy and how they're presented online. The mom is interfering by editing the photos in a way the author disagrees with. The author's main issue isn't just about the stickers but about the mom's actions being different for a girl versus a boy, which could be a gender bias issue.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting their child from being sexualized and maintaining her privacy. The mom's argument is about appropriateness for her audience. However, the author might be prioritizing their child's comfort and avoiding any form of objectification, which is a valid concern. The author is also asserting their authority as a parent to decide what's shared publicly about their child.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their child's well-being and privacy, which is a parent's right. The mom's actions could be seen as problematic because of the different treatment based on gender. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
