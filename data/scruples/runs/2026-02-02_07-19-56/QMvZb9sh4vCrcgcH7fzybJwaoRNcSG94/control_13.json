Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The situation involves a 17-month-old who's often in a diaper, and the grandmother is posting pictures with stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos aren't censored. They told their mom to stop posting the pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The child is a toddler, and the photos are of her in a diaper, which is common for young kids. The mother-in-law is editing the photos with stickers to cover the nipples. The author is upset because they think it's inappropriate to add those stickers, implying that the child is being sexualized. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers for her Facebook friends, but the author argues that the child's nipples are no different from their nephew's, who isn't censored.\n\nI should think about societal norms and privacy. In many places, it's acceptable for young children to be photographed in diaper-only outfits at home, especially if they're under two. However, sharing such photos on social media might be a point of contention. The grandmother's addition of stickers might be an overreaction, as a 17-month-old's body is not sexualized. The fact that the nephew is uncensored suggests possible double standards. \n\nThe author's stance is about protecting their child's image and preventing unnecessary sexualization. They also set a boundary by asking the grandmother to stop posting. The grandmother's justification that her friends need the stickers to view the photos without seeing the nipples might indicate that her audience isn't comfortable with even a toddler's body. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped by telling the grandmother to stop posting. However, the author is the parent, so they have the right to set boundaries regarding their child's exposure. The grandmother's actions could be harmful in the long run, adding unnecessary elements that imply the child needs to be censored. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's objection is valid. Since the child is a toddler, the nipples aren't a concern for modesty, and the stickers could be seen as inappropriate. The author isn't against the photos but against the editing. The grandmother's action might be projecting adult concerns onto a child. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the censorship of their child's natural body in photos. They have the right to decide how their child is represented online. The grandmother's actions might be based on her own discomfort or social norms, but the parent's authority takes precedence. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
