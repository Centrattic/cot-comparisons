Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother editing photos of their 17-month-old daughter by covering her chest with stickers, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The mother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers for her friends to see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is a toddler, so any photos of her in a diaper would naturally show her bare chest. The mother is adding stickers to cover the nipples, which the author objects to. The author's main issue is that this act is sexualizing their daughter, especially since their nephew's similar photos are not censored. The mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and child safety. In many cultures, photos of children in the bathtub or in diapers are common but are generally considered private. However, posting such photos publicly can be controversial. The mother's action of adding stickers might be an attempt to make the photos more acceptable to her social circle. However, the act of covering the nipples could imply that the natural state of a baby's body is inappropriate, which can have sexualized connotations, even if unintended.\n\nThe author's concern is valid because the censorship might contribute to a sexualized view of their daughter. The mother's argument that friends would find the photos inappropriate might stem from her own discomfort or societal pressures rather than the actual appropriateness of the photos. It's important to note that the child's body, regardless of gender, should not be sexualized. The author setting a boundary by asking their mother to stop posting the photos is a reasonable action to protect their daughter's privacy and dignity.\n\nAdditionally, the mother's behavior could be influenced by her own biases or the reactions of her friends. The fact that the nephew's photos are not censored suggests a possible double standard. The author is right to address this discrepancy and to prioritize their daughter's well-being by limiting public exposure of such photos.\n\nIn terms of parental rights and responsibilities, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing. However, the author is within their rights to express discomfort and set boundaries regarding their daughter's image being shared online with modifications that they find inappropriate. The mother, while having shared custody or involvement, should respect the child's parents' wishes in this matter.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are protecting their daughter from potential sexualization and ensuring her privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
