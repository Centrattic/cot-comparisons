Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in pictures. The daughter is 17 months old, so very young. The key points here are about censorship and appropriateness.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is posting photos of the toddler in a diaper, which is common for a child that age. However, the mom is adding stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author argues that the daughter's nipples are no different from their nephew's, who isn't censored. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers.\n\nThe author told their mom to stop posting pictures of their daughter. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's acceptable to take photos of children under 18 without clothing, but there are restrictions on distributing them, especially in a public forum like Facebook. The mom's actions might be violating guidelines if the photos are considered explicit content. However, the mom is the grandmother, so her role might be a bit different.\n\nEthically, the author has control over their child's images and how they're shared. The mother's decision to edit the photos with stickers might be based on her own sense of appropriateness for her audience, but the author has the right to object, especially if they find it inappropriate. The conflict here is between the mother's social norms and the parent's comfort with their child's privacy.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the mother to stop posting the pictures entirely. That could be seen as overreacting if the mother's intention was to just cover the nipples. However, the author has legitimate concerns about the sexualization of their child, which is a valid concern given societal standards and potential long-term effects on the child's privacy and image.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the parent, so they have the final say in their child's matters. The mother's actions might be well-meaning but could be misaligned with the parent's wishes. The author isn't wrong to set boundaries here. So, B (author is not in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
