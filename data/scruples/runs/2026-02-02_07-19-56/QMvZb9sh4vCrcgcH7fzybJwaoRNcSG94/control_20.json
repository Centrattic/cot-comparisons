Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mother's mom posting pictures of the 17-month-old granddaughter on Facebook. The daughter (the author) doesn't want her mom to cover the baby's chest in the photos. The grandma is putting stickers over the baby's nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author says the baby's nipples are the same as her nephew's, who isn't censored in the photos. The mother argues the uncensored pics are inappropriate for her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and the context. The baby is 17 months old, so she's a toddler. In many cultures, it's considered normal for young children to be naked or in diapers at home, and photos of them without clothing are not considered sexual. The key here is the difference between a baby and an older child. The author's nephew, being uncensored, suggests that the grandma's friends might be okay with male nudity but not female? That could be a societal bias. \n\nThe author is upset because the stickers are making the baby's body parts sexualized. The mother is covering them to make the photos appropriate for her friends. But the author believes that's unnecessary and possibly harmful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for objecting to the censorship.\n\nI think the main point is about parental rights and what's appropriate for the child's portrayal. The author is the parent, and she's making a request to not censor her daughter's body parts, which are natural. The mother is the grandparent, but the parent's wishes should take precedence here. The fact that the author told her mom not to post any more pictures might be a strong reaction, but maybe she felt strongly about it given the creepiness she mentioned. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often double standards about female nudity compared to male. The nephew isn't censored, which might indicate that the grandma's friends are okay with male toddler nudity but not female. The author is pushing back against that. So, covering the baby's nipples could be a form of unnecessary sexualization, which the author is rightly objecting to.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right as a parent to decide how her child is portrayed, especially against what she sees as inappropriate censorship. The grandma overstepped by making the photos inappropriate in the author's eyes. So, answer B.\n"
