Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their 17-month-old daughter's chest in photos. The mom posts a lot of the kid's pictures on Facebook, and she adds heart or smiley face stickers over the nipples. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since the same isn't done for the nephew. They told their mom to stop posting the pictures, and now they're questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about the mother's editing of the photos. The author is concerned that covering the baby's nipples with stickers is inappropriate and could be seen as sexualizing the child, especially when the nephew's similar photos are left uncensored. The mom's reasoning is that the photos are \"inappropriate\" for her friends without the stickers. \n\nNow, from a parental rights perspective, the author is the parent of the child and has the authority to decide how their child's images are shared. The mother-in-law is not the parent, so the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's privacy and how they're depicted. The author's discomfort with the stickers and the double standard with the nephew is valid. It's possible that the mother is projecting her own views on modesty, but the parent's decision takes precedence here.\n\nAdditionally, the author's response was to tell the mother not to post any more pictures. While this might be seen as abrupt, it's a clear boundary. It's up to the parent to decide what's acceptable for their child. The mother's action of adding stickers could indeed be perceived as unnecessary and potentially inappropriate, especially if it's drawing attention to the child's body parts. The author has the right to request that their child's photos not be altered in a way they find uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached the situation more collaboratively, maybe by discussing the concerns and suggesting alternatives, like not posting the photos in a way that requires editing. But given the mom's insistence on the stickers, the author's firm stance is understandable. The key point is that the parent has the final say in their child's representation, so the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
