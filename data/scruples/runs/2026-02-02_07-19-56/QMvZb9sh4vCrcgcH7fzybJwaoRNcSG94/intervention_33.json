Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so she's a toddler. The mom lets her run around in a diaper, which is pretty common for little kids. The grandmother is posting these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing.\n\nThe author argues that the daughter's nipples are the same as their nephew's, who's also uncensored in photos. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her friends without the stickers. The author then tells the mom not to post any more pictures of their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, taking and sharing photos of a minor is a parental right, but there are laws against sexualizing children. The grandmother is covering the nipples, possibly to avoid making them explicit, but the author feels it's unnecessary and inappropriate. The key here is whether the photos are considered explicit or not. Since the child is in a diaper, the photos might not be considered explicit in the same way as if the child were naked, but the act of censoring the nipples could be seen as adding a layer of sexualization. \n\nThe grandmother's friends might find the uncensored photos inappropriate, but the act of adding stickers could be the author's main issue. The author is concerned that the stickers are drawing attention to the nipples, which they see as unnecessary. However, the grandmother might be trying to protect the child's image by covering them for her audience. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, it's illegal to distribute explicit images of minors, but the line can be blurry. If the photos aren't explicit, the grandmother isn't breaking the law by posting them. However, the author has the right to control how their child's image is shared. By telling the grandmother to stop posting any pictures, the author is asserting their parental rights. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the stickers. The grandmother's actions might be well-intentioned, but the author's discomfort is valid. The key point is that the author is asking the grandmother to stop all posts, not just the censored ones. The grandmother might feel that she's just trying to make the photos appropriate for her audience. However, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's image. \n\nSo, considering the arguments, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They are protecting their child from what they perceive as unnecessary sexualization. The grandmother's actions might stem from a misunderstanding or a different cultural perspective. The author's response, while firm, is within their rights as a parent. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
