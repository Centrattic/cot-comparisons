Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's daughter, who is 17 months old, and they allow her to run around in her diaper at home, taking pictures. The author's mother posts these photos on Facebook but edits them by covering the child's nipples with heart or smiley face stickers. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since their nephew's similar photos are posted without such edits. They told their mom not to post more pictures of their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 17-month-old is a toddler, so there's a difference in how society views photos of infants versus older children. The author is concerned about the censorship of their daughter's nipples but not their nephew's. This might indicate a double standard, which could be a point in their favor. However, their mother is covering the nipples because she thinks the photos are inappropriate for her friends, which might relate to the audience seeing the photos. \n\nThe author's objection is that their mother is adding stickers that they find creepy and sexualizing. But the mother's reasoning is about appropriateness for Facebook. It's possible that the mother is trying to be considerate of her audience, but the method she's using is causing discomfort. \n\nThe author then tells their mother not to post any more pictures of their daughter. This is a significant action because the mother might see it as an overreaction. The key here is whether the author has the right to restrict their mother's posts about their grandchild. However, the child's parent is the one making the request, so they do have authority over how their child is portrayed publicly. \n\nThere's also the aspect of body autonomy and the parent's right to decide how their child is presented. The author might be right in asserting control over their daughter's image, especially if they find the censorship problematic. On the other hand, the mother's concern about appropriateness for Facebook is valid, but she might have asked for consent beforehand or discussed the editing method more carefully.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they are the parent and have the right to set boundaries about their child's photographs. Their mother's actions could be overstepping, especially if she's editing the photos without consulting the parent. The author's response, while firm, is a way to protect their child's image as they see fit. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
