Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, and at home, she's often in a diaper, so the photos are of her in just that. The mom posts these photos on Facebook but adds stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author told the mom to stop posting the photos, and now the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The child is a toddler, so infant nudity is a common topic. In many cultures, it's acceptable for young children to be nude in private settings, and photos of them in such states are sometimes shared among family. However, when it comes to social media, there are different norms and potential sensitivities. \n\nThe mother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, implying that she's trying to make them acceptable for her friends. But the author disagrees, arguing that the stickers are sexualizing the child. The mother is editing the photos, which could be seen as drawing attention to the body parts she's trying to cover. This might be perceived as more attention-grabbing than simply not posting the photos or using a different approach to make them more appropriate.\n\nThe author's action was to tell the mother to stop posting the photos. Since the author is the parent, they have a right to decide what is appropriate for their child's privacy and how their child is represented. The mother, while well-intentioned, may not realize that her edits are the issue. The author's discomfort is valid because they are the parent and are responsible for their child's well-being, including their image. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the authority to make decisions regarding their children's exposure in media. The mother's actions, while perhaps meant to be protective, might be overstepping if they are causing the parent to feel uncomfortable and leading to the child's images being sexualized. The author's boundary is reasonable here. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The mother's use of stickers may be the problem, and the author has the right to set that boundary.\n"
