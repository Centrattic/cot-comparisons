Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mother (the author) who's upset that her mom is adding stickers over her 17-month-old daughter's nipples in photos before posting them on Facebook. The author finds this creepy and sexualizing, especially since her nephew's similar photos are posted without censorship. The mother argues that the photos are inappropriate without the stickers, and the author told her mom to stop posting the pictures altogether.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The daughter is a toddler, so the photos in question are of a very young child. The grandmother is editing photos to cover nipples, which the author objects to. The author's main issue is that the act of covering the nipples with stickers is inappropriate and sexualizes the child. The grandmother's reasoning is that the photos are inappropriate for her Facebook friends without the stickers. The author then tells her mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, the possession of child pornography is a serious issue. However, photos of a child in a diaper, showing genitalia, might fall into a gray area, but generally, photos of a child under 18 in a state of undress can be considered child pornography if they're sexually explicit. However, there's a distinction between accidental exposure and intentional depiction for sexual gratification. Here, the grandmother is editing to cover the nipples, which might indicate that she's aware the photos without edits are inappropriate. The author's objection is not to the photos themselves but to the act of covering the nipples with stickers, which she finds more problematic.\n\nThe grandmother's action of adding stickers could be seen as an attempt to make the photos acceptable for her audience, which might be a different set of standards. The author, however, might see the act of covering the nipples as implying that the child's body should be censored, which could be a way of normalizing the censorship of children's bodies, especially when the same isn't done for her nephew. This could lead to a perception of objectification or sexualization.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her mother not to post any more pictures of the daughter. This is a strong reaction. The grandmother might feel that she's trying to share family moments, and the author is overreacting. However, the author's concern is about the potential for sexualization, which is a valid concern given the way the photos are being edited. The question is whether the author overstepped by banning all photos of her daughter on Facebook.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to control how her child's images are used, especially on public platforms. The child is a minor, so the parents have the authority to make decisions about their image. The grandmother's actions, while possibly intended to protect the photos from being considered inappropriate, might be seen as contributing to the sexualization by drawing attention to the body parts. The author's objection is about the method of censorship, not the nudity itself. However, the fact that the grandmother is adding stickers could be a way of making the photos more palatable for her social media friends, but the author might see the stickers as adding a layer of inappropriate attention.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at whose actions are more inconsiderate. The grandmother might be well-meaning but not considering the author's perspective. The author's reaction is firm, which could be seen as controlling, but her concern is valid. The key here is whether the author's refusal to allow any photos is justified. If the grandmother is posting photos in a way that the author finds harmful, then the author is within her rights to ask her not to post. However, the grandmother might feel that her own family photos are her right to share, but the parents have the final say on their child's image in public.\n\nIn legal terms, the parents have the right to decide how their child's image is used. So the author is not in the wrong for asking her mother to stop posting if she feels it's harmful. The grandmother's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, cross into the parents' domain by editing and posting the photos. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for asserting her authority over her child's image. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
