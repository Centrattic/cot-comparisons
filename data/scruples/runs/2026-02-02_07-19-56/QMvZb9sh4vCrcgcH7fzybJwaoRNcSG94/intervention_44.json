Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their mom to cover their daughter's chest in photos. The daughter is 17 months old, so very young. The mom takes lots of photos of the toddler in a diaper at home and posts them on Facebook. The grandmother adds stickers over the nipples, which the author finds creepy and sexualizing. The author then tells the grandmother not to post any more pictures. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around child nudity. In many places, it's legal to take and share photos of young children without clothing, especially in private settings. However, when these photos are shared publicly, especially on social media, there can be different perceptions. The grandmother is adding stickers to cover the nipples, which might be her way of making the photos more acceptable to her friends, but the author sees this as unnecessary and even sexualizing.\n\nThe key points here are the author's discomfort with the stickers and the grandmother's justification. The author argues that the stickers make the photos inappropriate, while the grandmother says the photos without stickers are inappropriate. The author then cuts off the grandmother from posting any pictures. Is the author wrong for doing that?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has the right to control their child's image. They can set boundaries on how and where photos are shared. The grandmother, as a family member, might have good intentions but is using the child's image without the parent's consent. The author's decision to stop the grandmother from posting is about protecting their child's privacy and image. \n\nSocially, there's a debate about when it's appropriate to share photos of children. Some people think it's fine, others are more cautious. The grandmother's addition of stickers might be an attempt to make the photos more palatable to her audience, but the author finds it creepy. The author's reaction is about their child's dignity and how they want her image presented. \n\nHowever, the author's approach is to completely stop the grandmother from posting any photos. Maybe a middle ground could have been found, like discussing the issue more and finding a compromise. But the grandmother didn't listen initially, so the author took a firm stance. \n\nIn terms of fault, the grandmother might be overstepping by editing the photos without consulting the parent. The author is asserting their right to control their child's image. The grandmother's reasoning about friends seeing the photos without stickers might be her way of dealing with her own social norms, but the parent's comfort and consent should take priority. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They have the right to decide how their child is portrayed. The grandmother's actions, while well-intentioned, might be crossing a line by modifying the photos without consent. The author's response is about protecting their child's image, so the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
