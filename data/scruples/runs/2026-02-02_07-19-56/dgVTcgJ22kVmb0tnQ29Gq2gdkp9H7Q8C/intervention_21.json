He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving part of the debt their daughter owes them. The situation involves a loan made to help the daughter's kids stay in a parochial school. The daughter and her husband were struggling financially, so the parent loaned them over $10k. Then, when the parent built a building, the son-in-law did the electrical work. The daughter later asked to forgive some of the debt because her husband helped with the parent's project. The parent refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not forgiving the debt. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the loan. Did the parent specify any conditions or agreements when making the loan? If it was a straightforward loan, then the expectation is repayment. If there was an understanding that it might be forgiven under certain circumstances, that's different. But the parent says they loaned it, implying an expectation of repayment. \n\nNext, the daughter's husband helping out with the electrical work. If the son-in-law worked on the parent's project, maybe that was a separate arrangement. The daughter is suggesting that because her husband helped the parent, the debt should be forgiven. The parent might see that as unrelated; the debt was for the school fees, not for the electrical work. \n\nThe parent's reasoning could be that the loan was a personal financial assistance to the daughter, separate from the son-in-law's work. Therefore, the parent isn't obligated to forgive the debt just because the son-in-law helped them in another matter. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parent feels a sense of family obligation or might have expected some repayment flexibility. However, the parent clearly stated they declined the forgiveness request. \n\nI think the key point is whether the parent had a prior agreement that the debt would be forgiven under certain conditions. Since there's no mention of such an agreement, the parent is acting within their rights to expect repayment. The daughter's husband's help on a different project doesn't necessarily obligate the parent to forgive the loan. \n\nTherefore, the parent is not in the wrong for not forgiving the debt. The answer would be B.\n"
