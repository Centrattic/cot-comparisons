Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent loaning money to their daughter and son-in-law for their children's school tuition, then later asking for repayment after the daughter finds a job. The daughter wants some forgiveness because her husband (the parent's SIL) did electrical work for the parent's new building. The parent refused to forgive the debt.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The parent loaned over $10k, which is a significant amount. They did it to help their kids stay in a private school. Then, when the parent built a pool house, the SIL did the electrical work. The daughter is now asking to forgive part of the debt because of the SIL's help. The parent says no, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nLegally, if the loans were formal, the parent has a right to expect repayment. But since this is between family, it's more about family dynamics. The parent might have expected repayment as a condition of the loan. The daughter's argument is based on the SIL's work, but the SIL is separate from the parent's debt. So, the parent might see it as separate transactions. \n\nThe daughter and son-in-law took on debt, and when they had the means (after the daughter got a job), the parent asked for repayment. The parent's refusal to forgive part of the debt could be seen as them standing by their original terms. \n\nHowever, in family matters, there's often an expectation of leniency. But if the parent made it clear it was a loan and not a gift, then they're within their rights to demand full repayment. The SIL's work might be a separate matter, but the parent isn't obligated to connect the two. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Probably not. They loaned money with the expectation of repayment. The daughter's argument is based on the SIL's work, which doesn't directly affect the loan. The parent's decision to refuse forgiveness is their right. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
