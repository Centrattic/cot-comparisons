      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is the asshole for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. Let me look at the details.\n\nSo, the parent loaned their daughter over $10k to keep the kids in parochial school. The daughter and her husband decided to take the kids out of that school when the wife was laid off. The parent didn't want that, so they loaned the money. Now, the parent built a building, and the daughter's husband (the SIL) did the electrical work. The daughter, after finding a job, asks about forgiving part of the debt because her husband helped with the building. The parent declined, and the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, loans are supposed to be repaid unless agreed otherwise. The parent made a loan, not a gift. The daughter's husband did work for them, but that's a separate matter. The parent might feel that the debt should be repaid in full. The daughter is asking to forgive some of it as a gesture of appreciation for the husband's help. But the parent isn't obligated to forgive the debt just because of that. \n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can complicate things. The parent provided financial help to keep the kids in school, which was a personal request. The daughter might feel that the parent should be more lenient, especially since the husband contributed to the building. However, the parent's decision to not forgive the debt is their right. \n\nIs the parent being unreasonable? Well, they did loan the money, and the daughter is now in a better position to repay. The parent isn't being cruel, just holding to the terms of the loan. The daughter might be asking for an adjustment, but the parent isn't wrong to say no. So the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
