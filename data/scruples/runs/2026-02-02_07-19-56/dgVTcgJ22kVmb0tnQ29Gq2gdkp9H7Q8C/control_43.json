He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The daughter and her husband had financial trouble, so the parent loaned them over $10k to keep their kids in private school. Then the parent built a building where the daughter's husband (the SIL) did the electrical work. When the parent asked for repayment, the daughter wanted some forgiven because her husband helped with the electrical work. The parent said no.\n\nFirst, the parent loaned the money as a loan, not a gift. So expecting repayment is normal. The daughter's husband did some work on the parent's building. But the parent didn't ask for that as part of the loan agreement. So the parent might be using that as a reason for forgiveness, but if the original loan didn't include that condition, the parent isn't obligated to forgive any part. The daughter might feel that since her husband helped, they should owe less, but the parent isn't required to accept that. \n\nThe key points are: Was the loan agreed upon with specific terms? If the parent didn't specify that help on the building would reduce the debt, then the forgiveness isn't required. The parent isn't in the wrong for not forgiving the debt. They can choose to forgive it, but they aren't obligated. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
