He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The situation involves the parent loaning money to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in a private school. The daughter was laid off, so the parent stepped in. Later, the son-in-law did electrical work on the parent's new building. When the parent asked for repayment, the daughter wanted some forgiveness because the son-in-law had helped them. The parent refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the original loan. It was a personal loan, not a gift. The parent might have intended it to be repaid, so expecting payment is reasonable. However, the parent received help from the son-in-law in building a pool house. The daughter is asking to forgive part of the debt as a trade for that help. \n\nThe key points are: Was the electrical work prearranged as payment towards the debt? If the son-in-law's work was a separate service, maybe the parent should have charged them for it, which could offset the debt. But if there was no prior agreement, then the parent might be expected to handle the payment separately. \n\nThe parent might feel that the debt should be repaid as per the original agreement. The daughter's argument is that in exchange for the son-in-law's work, some of the debt should be forgiven. However, the parent might not have intended the work as repayment unless agreed beforehand. \n\nIn many cases, informal loans among family can be tricky. If there was no clear agreement to forgive part of the debt in exchange for the work, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They could have either charged for the work or kept the debt separate. But if they accepted the work as partial payment, then the debt could be adjusted. However, since the parent didn't mention any prior agreement, the refusal to forgive the debt might be justified. \n\nThe daughter's request seems to be trying to use the son-in-law's work as a barter. If the parent didn't agree to that beforehand, the daughter might be trying to use the work as a bargaining chip now. The parent's decision to not forgive the debt could be seen as upholding the original terms of the loan, which is reasonable unless there was an implicit agreement. \n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong (B) because they honored the loan terms without prior agreement for forgiveness. The daughter's request might be unreasonable without prior arrangement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
