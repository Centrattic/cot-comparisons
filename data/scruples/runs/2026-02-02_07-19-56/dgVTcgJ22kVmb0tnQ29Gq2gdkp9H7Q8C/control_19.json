Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. \n\nFirst, the context: The parent loaned their daughter and son-in-law $10k+ to keep their kids in a parochial school after the daughter was laid off. Now that the parent built a building and the son-in-law did the electrical work, the daughter asked to forgive some debt because her husband helped. The parent refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are the nature of the loan and the repayment terms. When you loan money, especially to family, there can be different expectations. The parent didn't specify terms upfront, but the daughter might have assumed some forgiveness because of the husband's help. However, the parent might have considered it a loan that needs to be repaid in full, especially since it was to help with school expenses.\n\nWas the loan a gift or an actual loan? The parent says they \"loaned\" the money, so there might be an expectation of repayment. The daughter's request to forgive part of it because her husband helped could be seen as a way to offset the work he did. But the parent isn't obligated to forgive the debt unless agreed upon, especially if there was no prior agreement.\n\nThe parent might be justified in expecting full repayment, especially if the loan was a financial necessity for the daughter's family. On the other hand, the daughter's husband helping with the parent's project could be a quid pro quo situation, but the parent might not see it that way unless it was part of the original agreement.\n\nSo, the parent's refusal isn't necessarily wrong because they provided a loan, not a gift. However, the daughter's request might be reasonable given the husband's contribution. But without prior agreement, forgiveness is at the parent's discretion. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
