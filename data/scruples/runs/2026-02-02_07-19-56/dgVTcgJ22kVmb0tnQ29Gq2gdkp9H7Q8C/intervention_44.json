He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. The situation involves a loan given to the daughter and her husband to keep their kids in a parochial school. The parents later built a pool house, and the son-in-law did the electrical work. The daughter wants some debt forgiven because her husband helped with the building.\n\nFirst, the initial loan was a financial help to keep the kids in school. The parents didn't want the kids to switch to public schools, so they provided the money. Now, the daughter is asking for forgiveness because her husband did electrical work for them. The key here is whether the electrical work was part of the debt forgiveness or if it's a separate matter.\n\nIf the parents had an agreement that the electrical work would reduce the debt, then the author might be in the wrong for not honoring it. But if there was no such agreement, then the author is justified in not forgiving the debt. The post mentions that the author declined when asked to forgive some of the money based on the husband's help. The question is whether that help was considered part of the debt repayment from the start.\n\nAlso, considering the context, the loan was given for the school expenses. The husband's work on the pool house is a separate service. Unless there was an explicit agreement to reduce the debt with this work, the author isn't obligated to forgive the debt. The daughter's request might be conflating two separate transactions: the loan for school and the husband's electrical work for the building. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they can choose not to forgive the debt unless there's a prior agreement. The answer here would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
