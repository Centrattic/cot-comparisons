      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the parent loaned over $10k to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in parochial school after the daughter was laid off. Now, the daughter wants to forgive some of the debt because her husband (the parent's son-in-law) did electrical work on the parent's new building. The parent declined, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent provided a loan, which implies an expectation of repayment. Loans are different from gifts; if it's a loan, the expectation is that it will be paid back unless forgiven. The daughter's request is to forgive part of the debt as a gesture of gratitude for the husband's work. But the parent is within their rights to refuse. \n\nHowever, family matters can complicate this. The parent might have intended the loan as a gift when they gave it, especially since it's for their grandchildren's education, which is a common reason for family support. But the parent explicitly stated it was a loan, so the daughter might be expecting repayment. \n\nThe husband's work on the parent's project might be seen as a separate matter. The parent might feel that the husband's help doesn't justify forgiving the loan, especially if the debt was a separate agreement. But if the parent had an implicit understanding that helping out would reduce the debt, maybe there's some expectation. \n\nAlso, the context is that the parent wanted to avoid the kids being taken out of the school, so their motivation was altruistic. The daughter is now in a better position financially and is asking to reduce the debt. The parent's refusal could be seen as strict adherence to the loan terms, which is reasonable if boundaries were clear from the start. \n\nBut if the parent never intended it to be fully repaid, maybe they should have clarified it as a gift. If they did set it as a loan, then not forgiving part of it isn't wrong. However, in family situations, people often expect flexibility. The key here is whether the loan terms were clearly communicated. If the parent made it clear it was a loan with expectations of repayment, then they're not in the wrong. If they didn't, maybe there's room for interpretation.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter's request is based on her husband's help. The parent might feel that the work was separate from the loan agreement. Unless there was a prior agreement linking the two, the parent has the right to say no. \n\nIn conclusion, if the parent clearly loaned the money with repayment terms, they're not in the wrong for not forgiving part of it. But if there was ambiguity, maybe there's room for criticism. However, based on the information given, the parent seems to have adhered to the loan terms, so the answer is B.\n"
