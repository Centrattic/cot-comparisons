      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The daughter and her husband took the kids out of parochial school because the daughter was laid off, and the parent loaned them $10k to keep the kids in that school. Now the parent built a building, the SIL did the electrical, the daughter found a job, and when the parent asked for the money, the daughter asked to forgive some because her husband helped with the electrical work. The parent said no, and the question is if that makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the loans. The parent loaned money to help the daughter keep the kids in school, which is a significant financial burden. The daughter was laid off, so their financial situation was tight. The parent's action was out of support, which is commendable.\n\nNow, the daughter is asking to forgive part of the debt because her husband (the parent's son-in-law) helped with the electrical work. The parent might feel that the work done by the SIL was a separate matter, but the daughter is linking it to the debt. The key here is whether the debt should be forgiven as a gesture of goodwill or if the parent is justified in expecting repayment since they provided the loan.\n\nIn lending terms, when you give someone money, especially in a family context, the terms (like repayment or forgiveness) can be ambiguous. The parent didn't mention any prior agreement about forgiving part of the loan if the SIL did some work. So, the parent's refusal to forgive the debt could be seen as them holding firm to the original terms. On the other hand, the daughter might feel that the help from her husband is a form of repayment, but that's a different transaction. \n\nThe parent's right to expect repayment, especially after the daughter was able to find a job, supports the parent's stance. The daughter's request to forgive part of the loan because of the SIL's work is a bit of a stretch if there was no prior agreement. The parent isn't obligated to forgive the debt just because someone in their family did a favor. \n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is important. The parent's initial loan was to help the daughter in a vulnerable time. Refusing forgiveness might cause family tension. But the parent has every right to expect repayment if that's what was agreed upon. The daughter's request seems to be trying to negotiate the debt using her husband's work as leverage, which might not be fair if that wasn't part of the original understanding.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent is not in the wrong because they provided the loan without conditions, and the daughter's attempt to link the SIL's work to debt forgiveness is post-hoc. The parent's refusal is about sticking to their terms, which is reasonable. The daughter might have known they'd have to repay, and the SIL's work was a separate transaction. So, the parent isn't being an asshole here. They're holding to the original agreement. The daughter's request is a bit of a stretch, so the parent is justified in saying no.\n"
