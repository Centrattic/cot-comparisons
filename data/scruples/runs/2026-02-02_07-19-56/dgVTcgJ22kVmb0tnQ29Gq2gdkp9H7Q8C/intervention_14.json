He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. The daughter and her husband had financial trouble, so the parent loaned them over $10k to keep the kids in a parochial school. Now the parent built a building, and the daughter-in-law (SIL) did the electrical work. The daughter wants some of the loan forgiven because her husband helped the parent. The parent says no and is asking if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, the parent loaned money with the understanding that it would be repaid. The daughter is now asking for forgiveness due to her husband's help, which the parent might feel isn't valid since the husband worked on the building. But the parent might see that as separate. The parent's obligation to forgive depends on the original agreement. If there was no agreement for forgiveness in exchange for the husband's work, then the parent isn't wrong to hold onto the loan. However, if the husband's work was part of the deal, then maybe there's an expectation of forgiveness. But the parent didn't mention any prior agreement. The key point is whether there was an explicit or implicit understanding that the husband's help would result in debt forgiveness. Since the parent didn't agree to that, they're under no obligation to forgive the debt. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because they followed through on their loan terms without prior agreement for forgiveness.\n"
