      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt.\n\nSo the situation is: The author loaned their daughter over $10k to keep her kids in parochial school after they switched to public. The daughter had a job, then the author asked for the money back. The daughter wanted some forgiveness because her husband did electrical work on the author's building. The author refused. Now the question is, is the author wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to help the daughter keep the kids in a certain school. The daughter and husband took the money as a loan, so there was an expectation of repayment. When the daughter wanted to forgive part of it because her husband helped, the author said no. \n\nKey points: Was the original agreement a loan or a gift? The author said \"loaned,\" so it's a loan with repayment expected. The daughter didn't specify it as a gift, so the author's refusal to forgive part of the debt might be justified. \n\nAlso, the daughter is asking for forgiveness because her husband did some work. But the author's SIL (who is the daughter's mother-in-law, I assume) did the electrical work. Wait, the user mentions \"my SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job...\" Wait, the SIL is the daughter's sister-in-law? Or mother-in-law? The term SIL can be confusing. But in the context, the author's daughter's husband did the electrical work for the author's building. Wait, the author says \"My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job...\" Wait, maybe the SIL is the daughter's sister-in-law, but that might not matter. The key is that the daughter's husband did the electrical work, which the daughter is citing as a reason to forgive some debt. \n\nBut if the author is the one who allowed the SIL to do the electrical, perhaps there was no payment involved. If the SIL worked for free, maybe the author feels it's a family favor, not a paid job. Therefore, the author might not owe anything for that work. So the daughter's reasoning for requesting forgiveness is based on her husband's unpaid help. \n\nThe author's refusal is based on the fact that it was a loan, and they're not in the habit of forgiving debts. The daughter didn't ask for forgiveness initially; she only asked after the author requested repayment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the author is unreasonable in not forgiving part of the debt. If the loan was explicit and there was no prior agreement to forgive part of it based on other favors, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is being rigid and not considering the family context, maybe they are. But typically, loans are expected to be repaid, especially when given as a loan rather than a gift. \n\nThe daughter might feel that the author is being unkind, but from the author's perspective, they provided a loan to help, and now expect repayment. The husband's unpaid work might not equate to owing money, especially if it was a family favor. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's position seems more justified. They provided a loan with the expectation of repayment, and the daughter's request is a new consideration that wasn't part of the original agreement. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
