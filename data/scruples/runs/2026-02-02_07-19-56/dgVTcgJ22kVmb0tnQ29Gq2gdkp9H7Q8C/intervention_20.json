      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who loaned money to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in a parochial school. Now, after the daughter got a job and the parent built a house where the son-in-law did the electrical work, the daughter asked to have some of the debt forgiven. The parent refused and the question is whether they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent loaned money with a specific purpose. Loans, even informal ones between family, usually expect repayment. The daughter is asking for forgiveness because her husband helped the parent with electrical work. But the parent's main reason for the loan was to keep the kids in the school. \n\nThe parent might feel that since they provided the loan to maintain the school, they expected it to be repaid. The daughter's request seems to tie the debt forgiveness to the son-in-law's work. However, the parent didn't mention that the electrical work was part of the agreement. If the parent had expected the electrical work as payment in exchange for the loan, maybe that should have been stated upfront. But there's no indication that was the case here. \n\nAlso, the parent might view the loan as a separate matter from the electrical work. The daughter and her husband did a favor by doing the electrical work, but that doesn't necessarily mean the parent is obligated to forgive the debt. The parent might see it as two separate transactions: the loan for the school and the electrical work as a separate help. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that expecting repayment without any prior agreement could be seen as harsh, especially if the loan was given out of good intentions. However, since it was a loan, not a gift, the expectation of repayment is reasonable. The daughter's request to forgive part of the debt because of the electrical work might be perceived as trying to get something out of the parent, which the parent isn't obligated to do. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent isn't in the wrong for not forgiving the debt. The daughter's husband helping with the electrical work is a separate act of kindness or favor, not necessarily payment for the loan. The parent isn't required to forgive the debt unless there was an agreement linking the two. Therefore, the parent's decision to decline forgiveness is justified.\n"
