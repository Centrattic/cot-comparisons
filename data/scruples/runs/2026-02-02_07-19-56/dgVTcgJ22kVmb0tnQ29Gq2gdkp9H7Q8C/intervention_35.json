He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. The situation involves a loan from the parent to the daughter and her husband to keep their kids in a parochial school. The daughter later found a job and the parent asked for the money back. The daughter's husband (the parent's son-in-law) did electrical work on the parent's new building, and the daughter asked to have some debt forgiven because of that. The parent refused.\n\nFirst, the parent loaned money with the intention that it would be repaid. The daughter and son-in-law's situation improved as the daughter got a job, so repayment became feasible. The parent is now asking for the money back. The daughter's request to forgive part of the debt is based on the son-in-law's help, but the parent sees that as unrelated to the original loan.\n\nThe key points here are the terms of the original loan. If the parent didn't specify any conditions about the debt being forgiven for any reason, then they're within their rights to expect repayment. However, if the parent had an understanding that the debt would be forgiven if certain things happened (like the son-in-law helping with the electrical work), then not forgiving part of it might be seen as unfair. But in this case, the parent didn't agree to any such terms. The daughter is trying to use the son-in-law's help as a reason to reduce the debt, but the parent didn't make that a condition. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's a formal agreement, the parent can decide whether to forgive part or all of the debt. The parent is not obligated to forgive the debt based on the son-in-law's work because that wasn't part of the original agreement. The parent's refusal is based on the principle that loans should be repaid as agreed unless there's a mutual agreement to modify the terms.\n\nEmotionally, the parent might feel that helping the daughter's family was an act of support, and the repayment is important for their own financial reasons. The daughter might feel that the help from her husband should reduce their debt, but that's a different perspective. However, the parent's decision not to forgive the debt is within their rights, especially since the son-in-law's work wasn't part of the original loan terms. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong because they have the right to expect repayment as per the original loan agreement. The daughter's request is based on a different context (her husband's work) that wasn't part of the initial agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
