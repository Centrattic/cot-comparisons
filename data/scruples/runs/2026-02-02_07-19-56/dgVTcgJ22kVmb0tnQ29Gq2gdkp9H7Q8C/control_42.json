He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not forgiving part of the debt their daughter and son-in-law had to them. \n\nFirst, the parent loaned over $10,000 to help keep the kids in a parochial school after the daughter was laid off. Now that the daughter has a job again, the parent is asking for the money back. The daughter's husband did some electrical work for the parent's new building, and the daughter wants to forgive some of the debt because of that. The parent refused.\n\nSo, the main points here are: was the loan intended to be a gift or a loan? The parent called it a loan, so they expected repayment. The daughter is now asking to forgive part of it in exchange for the son-in-law's work. The parent declined, thinking they have a right to the full amount.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if it's a loan, the parent isn't obligated to forgive any part unless agreed upon. The parent isn't in the wrong for expecting repayment. The daughter's argument is that their help (electrical work) should be compensation. But unless the parent and daughter had an agreement that the electrical work would count toward the debt, it's not a valid reason to forgive the loan. \n\nEmotionally, maybe the parent feels they helped out of necessity, but legally and ethically, if they loaned the money with the understanding that it's a loan, they can choose to forgive it or not. The parent isn't wrong for declining to forgive part of it. The daughter might feel entitled, but the parent's position is valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they made a loan and have the right to expect repayment unless they agree to forgive it. The son-in-law's work isn't compensation unless previously agreed. The parent's refusal is reasonable.\n"
