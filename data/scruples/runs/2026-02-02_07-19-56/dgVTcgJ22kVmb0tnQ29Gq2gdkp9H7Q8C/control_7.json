He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public.

Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author loaned their daughter and son-in-law over $10k to keep their kids in a parochial school. The daughter was laid off, so they switched to public school. The author helped them stay in the parochial school. Now, the author built a building, and the son-in-law did the electrical work. When the author asked for repayment, the daughter wanted some forgiveness because her husband helped with the building. The author said no, and now the question is if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let me think. The key points are the initial loan and the expectation of repayment. The author provided a loan, not a gift. Loans typically expect repayment. The daughter is asking for forgiveness because the son-in-law did some work. But the original loan was for school expenses, separate from the building project. The son-in-law's work on the building might be a separate matter. The author isn't obligated to forgive debt just because someone in their family helped them in another way. \n\nThe daughter and son-in-law might feel entitled to some forgiveness because of the son-in-law's help, but the loans were separate. The author isn't wrong for declining. They made a loan with the expectation of repayment. The daughter's request seems to mix two different situations. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
