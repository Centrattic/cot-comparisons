He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a parent loaning money to their daughter and son-in-law to help keep their kids in a private school. The parent then built a building, and the son-in-law did the electrical work. When the parent asks for repayment, the daughter wants some forgiveness because her husband helped with the project. The parent refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent loaned money as a favor to help them stay in private school. The daughter was laid off, so they might be in a tough spot financially. The parent's intention might have been to help, expecting repayment when possible. Now that the daughter is back to work, she's asking for forgiveness, especially since her husband helped with the building project.\n\nThe key points are: Was the loan a gift or a loan? If it was a loan, the parent isn't obligated to forgive it unless agreed upon. The daughter might feel entitled because the husband helped with the electrical work, but unless there was a prior agreement that the electrical work would reduce the debt, the parent isn't wrong for not forgiving it. However, if the parent considered it a gift, then expecting repayment could be seen as unfair. But the parent explicitly said it was a loan, so they have the right to ask for it back. The daughter's request for forgiveness is a matter of negotiation, but the parent isn't obligated to agree. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
