He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a scenario where a parent is being asked if they're in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The parent loaned money to help their daughter's kids stay in a parochial school after she got laid off. Now the daughter wants some forgiveness because her husband helped with the parent's project. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent lent money as a loan, not a gift. The daughter and her husband then used the parent's money to cover school expenses. Now, the daughter is asking to forgive part of the debt because her husband helped with the parent's building project. The parent declined.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the original loan a gift or a loan? The parent said they loaned the money, so it's a loan. The daughter is now asking for forgiveness because her husband provided a service. The parent is refusing. The user is asking if the parent is wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the parent is justified in not forgiving the debt. If the loan was an agreement without any terms of forgiveness, then the parent isn't obligated to forgive part of it. However, if there was an expectation that helping out would result in forgiveness, that's different. But the parent didn't mention any prior agreement. The daughter's husband did electrical work for the parent, which might be a separate transaction. The parent might have compensated him for that work, but that's not stated. Alternatively, the daughter is linking her husband's help to the debt forgiveness, which the parent didn't agree to.\n\nSo, the parent's refusal is based on the original loan terms. Unless there was an agreement that services provided would reduce the debt, the parent isn't in the wrong. The daughter's request seems to be using her husband's work as a bargaining chip, which the parent isn't required to accept. The parent isn't obligated to forgive the debt unless they agree to it. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
