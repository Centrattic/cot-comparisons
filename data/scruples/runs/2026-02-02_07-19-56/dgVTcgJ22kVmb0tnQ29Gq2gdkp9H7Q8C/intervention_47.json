He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent loaning money to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in a private school. Later, when the parent built a structure and the son-in-law did the electrical work, the daughter asked to forgive some of the debt because of the help. The parent refused, and now the question is whether they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parent loaned $10k+ for the kids' education, which they were willing to help with. Then, when the parent builds a building, the son-in-law does the electrical work. The parent mentions the debt and the daughter asks about forgiving some of it as a thank you for the son-in-law's help. The parent says no.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The initial loan was for the kids' education, which is a significant expense. Parents often help with education costs, especially for grandchildren. However, the parent didn't specify it was a gift, so it's a loan. The daughter is now asking to have part of it forgiven because the son-in-law helped with the electrical work. \n\nSo, is the parent obligated to forgive the debt? If the loan was a formal agreement, then the parent isn't required to forgive part of it. But since it's between family, maybe there's an expectation of flexibility. However, the parent helped them stay in the school out of their own resources, and then the son-in-law provided a service in return. The daughter is using the son-in-law's help as a reason to ask for forgiveness. \n\nIs it fair for the parent to expect repayment? If the loan was intended to be a loan, then yes. But if it was a gift, then the parent might be in the wrong for expecting repayment. However, the parent didn't frame it as a gift. So, the parent is within their rights to ask for repayment. The daughter's request to forgive some of the debt might be seen as using the son-in-law's help as a bargaining chip, which could be a bit self-serving. \n\nThe parent's refusal is based on the fact that it's a loan and they didn't agree to terms of forgiveness. The parent might feel that the help with the electrical work was a separate transaction and not a reason to reduce the debt. Also, the parent might not want to set a precedent where family members can reduce debts by providing services. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent should be more lenient, especially since the money was for the kids' education. But the parent made a loan, not a gift. So, the parent isn't in the wrong for not forgiving the debt. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
