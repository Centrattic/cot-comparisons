He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. The situation is that the parents loaned money to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in parochial school. The daughter was laid off, so they switched to public school, but the parents stepped in with a loan. Later, when the author built a pool house, the son-in-law did the electrical work. When the author asked for repayment, the daughter wants some forgiveness because the son-in-law helped. The author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The loan was a personal loan, not a gift. Loans typically expect repayment. The daughter is asking to forgive part of the debt because her husband did some work for the author. The author might see this as a separate matter. The key points here are: Was the loan a gift or a loan? Since the author kept track of the exact amount and asked for repayment, it's a loan. The daughter's request to forgive part because of the husband's help is a new factor. But should the author consider that? The husband's help might be seen as a separate transaction. The author might not feel obligated to forgive the debt just because of that. \n\nBut is it fair? If the loan was a personal loan, then the author has the right to expect full repayment. However, sometimes family loans are informal and might be repaid in different ways. But the author was clear about the amount owed. The daughter is asking for forgiveness because of the husband's help, which the author might not view as related. The author's refusal could be seen as being strict, but if it was a loan, then they aren't in the wrong. Some might argue that family dynamics and goodwill are important, but legally and morally, if it's a loan, the author isn't obligated to forgive it. So, answer B: No.\n"
