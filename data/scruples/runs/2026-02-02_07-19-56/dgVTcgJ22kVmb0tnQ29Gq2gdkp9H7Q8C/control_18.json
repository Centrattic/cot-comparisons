      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. They loaned over $10k to help the kids stay in parochial school, which the daughter and her husband were trying to move to public school. Now, the daughter wants some forgiven because her husband did electrical work on the parent's new building.\n\nFirst, the original loan was a favor to keep the kids in school, likely a significant financial burden for the daughter and her spouse. The parent provided the money with the expectation it would be repaid. The daughter is now asking for forgiveness because her husband helped out with her parent's project. \n\nThe key points here: Was the loan a gift or a loan? If it was a loan, the parent isn't obligated to forgive it unless they agreed to. The daughter's husband's work on the parent's project might not directly relate to the original loan. The parent might see the work as separate, so using that as a reason for forgiveness could be seen as unfair. The parent's refusal could be justified if they made the loan terms clear from the start. However, if there was an expectation of forgiveness or if the situation was misunderstood, that might tip the balance. But based on the information, the parent isn't in the wrong for not forgiving the debt. So, answer B.\n"
