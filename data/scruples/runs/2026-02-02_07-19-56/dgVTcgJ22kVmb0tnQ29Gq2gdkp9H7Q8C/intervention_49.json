He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The situation is that the author loaned money to their daughter and her husband to keep their kids in a parochial school. Now, the author built a building and the daughter's husband did the electrical work. When the author asked for repayment, the daughter asked to forgive some of the debt because her husband helped with the building. The author refused, and the user is wondering if that's the right move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The loans were for their children's education, which is a significant expense. The author might have felt it was important for the kids to stay in the school, so there's an emotional aspect here. Then, the husband did electrical work for the author's new building. The daughter is asking to reduce the debt because of this help, implying some kind of exchange or repayment.\n\nBut loans are typically expected to be repaid unless there's an agreement otherwise. The author didn't mention any prior arrangement where helping with the electrical work would count towards the debt. The SIL (the daughter's husband) doing the electrical work might be part of their professional help, but unless it was agreed that this would offset the loan, the author isn't obligated to forgive the debt. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The author's refusal might be seen as strict, but they might have a right to expect repayment as per the original terms.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that considering the family relationship and the husband's contribution to the building, forgiving part of the debt could be a kind gesture. But the author might have their reasons, like wanting to set a boundary or ensuring the loan was treated as a loan, not a gift.\n\nI think the key here is whether there was any prior agreement that the electrical work would count towards the loan. Since the author didn't mention such an agreement, they're not in the wrong for refusing to forgive the debt. The daughter's request seems a bit opportunistic, using the husband's work as a reason to reduce the loan without prior discussion. So the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
