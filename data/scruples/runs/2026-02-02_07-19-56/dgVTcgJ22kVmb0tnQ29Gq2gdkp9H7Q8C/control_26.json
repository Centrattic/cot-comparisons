He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who loaned money to their daughter and her husband so they could keep their kids in a private school. Then when the parent built a building and the daughter-in-law did the electrical work, the daughter asked for some debt forgiveness because her husband helped the parent. The parent declined.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The parent provided a loan, not a gift, which was a significant amount. The daughter and her husband used the money for school expenses. Now, the daughter is asking for forgiveness, possibly because her husband's work on the parent's property might be considered payment.\n\nBut the parent made it clear it was a loan. So if the parent expects repayment, they're not in the wrong. The daughter's argument is that her husband's help (SIL doing the electrical work) should count as payment. But the parent might view the electrical work as separate from the loan. Unless there was an agreement that the work would offset the debt, the parent isn't obligated to forgive the loan. \n\nAlso, the daughter was the one who asked for forgiveness, which implies she's in a position of needing leniency. The parent's refusal is their right since it was a loan. There's no mention of the parent expecting work in exchange for the loan initially. The SIL's work was for the parent's building, so unless the parent agreed it would cover part of the debt, the parent isn't wrong to decline forgiveness. \n\nSo the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
