He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The situation is that the daughter and her husband had a financial need, so the parent loaned them $10k. Then the author built a building where the son-in-law did the electrical work. When the daughter asked to forgive part of the debt because her husband helped, the author said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Loans between family members can be tricky. The parent made a loan, expecting repayment. The daughter wants some forgiven because her husband contributed to the parent's project. The parent declined. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about agreements and fairness. If there was a clear agreement that the help would reduce the debt, then the parent might be wrong not to honor that. But if there was no such agreement, the parent isn't obligated. \n\nThe parent's perspective is that the loan was a separate matter. They helped with tuition because they wanted the kids to stay in school, not as a trade-off for the husband's work. The daughter's husband did electrical work for the parent, which might be seen as a separate transaction. \n\nSo, if the parent didn't agree to forgive the debt in exchange for the electrical work, then the parent isn't in the wrong for not doing so. The daughter's request to forgive part of the debt based on the husband's help might not be justified unless there was a prior agreement. \n\nTherefore, the parent's decision to not forgive the debt, based on the lack of a prior agreement, makes them not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
