He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. The situation involves a loan of over $10k for the daughter's kids' school fees. The daughter and her husband then helped the parent by doing electrical work for their new building.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent loaned money with the intention of helping the kids stay in parochial school. The daughter later repays the parent, asking for some forgiveness because her husband helped with the building project. The parent is declining to forgive any part of the loan.\n\nThe key points are: Was the loan an agreement where forgiveness was expected? Did the parent and daughter have a clear understanding when the money was given? Also, the daughter's husband's help might be a factor in the request for forgiveness. But was the parent's help conditional on future favors?\n\nIf the parent didn't set any conditions for the loan, then they're under no obligation to forgive part of it. On the other hand, if the daughter's husband's help was part of the original agreement or if there was an expectation that helping would lead to debt forgiveness, then the parent might be in the wrong for not following through. But the problem states that the parent didn't mention any such conditions. The daughter only asked for forgiveness after her husband helped, which the parent might not have anticipated.\n\nAlso, family loans can be tricky. It's possible the parent intended it as a loan with interest, but the daughter might see it as a gift. However, the parent is clearly stating it was a loan, so they have a right to expect repayment. The daughter asking for forgiveness based on her husband's help might be a stretch unless there was prior agreement.\n\nSo, in this case, if the parent never agreed to forgive any part of the loan when they gave the money, they aren't in the wrong by not doing so later. The daughter's request is after the fact, and the parent isn't obligated to adjust the terms without prior agreement. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
