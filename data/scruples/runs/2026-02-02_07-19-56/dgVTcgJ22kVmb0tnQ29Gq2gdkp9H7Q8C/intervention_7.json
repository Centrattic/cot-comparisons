He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public.

Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not forgiving part of the debt their daughter and son-in-law incurred. The parent loaned $10k for private school tuition, then later built a building where the son-in-law did the electrical work. The daughter then asked to forgive some of the debt because her husband helped the parent. The parent refused and the question is if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the initial loan: the parent gave money to help the daughter's kids stay in their school. The parent might have done this with the expectation of repayment, but maybe not. It's a family loan, which can be tricky because expectations aren't always clear. The parent didn't specify terms when giving the loan, which is common in family situations but can lead to issues later.\n\nThen, the son-in-law did electrical work for the parent. The daughter is asking to forgive debt because her husband helped. The parent refuses. The key here is whether the help from the son-in-law was part of an agreement. If the parent didn't agree to that in advance, then the daughter's request is a post-hoc justification for forgiveness. The parent might feel that the loan terms are clear and that the son-in-law's help isn't part of the deal.\n\nBut wait, the parent's own statement says they \"didn't want to see the kids taken out of parochial school,\" so the loan was likely a kindness, not a business transaction. If the parent didn't agree to any exchange for the son-in-law's help, then the daughter's argument is weak. The parent might be within their rights to expect repayment as per the original agreement.\n\nOn the flip side, if the parent's intention was always to help without expecting repayment, then not forgiving part of it could be seen as being strict. But since the parent is now asking if they're in the wrong, it's possible they expected repayment. So the answer hinges on whether the parent made it clear the loan was with the condition that any help from the son-in-law would reduce the debt. Since they didn't, the parent's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The daughter's request is a new condition that wasn't part of the original agreement. So the answer might be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
