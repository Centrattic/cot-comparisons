He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. \n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter and her husband had their kids in a private school, then moved them to public after a layoff. The author loaned them over $10k to keep them in private school. Later, the author built a building where the daughter-in-law did the electrical work. The daughter found a job and asked how much they owed. The daughter then asked to forgive some because the husband helped the author. The author refused.\n\nSo, the main points are about borrowing money and whether forgiving part of it is expected. The author sees it as a loan, not a gift, so expecting repayment. The daughter is asking for forgiveness because her husband provided a service. \n\nLending money to family can be tricky. The author might have thought it was a loan with the understanding that it would be repaid. The daughter might feel that since her husband helped the author with the electrical work, that's a form of repayment. But the author didn't ask for help and might see the electrical work as separate from the loan.\n\nIs the author wrong for not forgiving the debt? If the loan was agreed upon without conditions, then the author isn't obligated to forgive any part. The daughter's offer to forgive some based on her husband's help might be seen as a way to reduce their debt, but the author isn't required to accept that. \n\nPossible angles: 1. The author lent money with the expectation of repayment. Not forgiving is within their rights. 2. The daughter is trying to negotiate repayment terms, but the author isn't obliged. 3. The fact that the SIL did electrical work might be a point of contention, but unless there was an agreement to offset the loan with that work, it's separate.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a loan and can decide whether to forgive it. The answer is B.\n"
