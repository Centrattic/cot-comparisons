Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the parent loaning money to their daughter and her husband to keep their kids in a parochial school. The daughter then asks to forgive some of the debt because her husband did electrical work on the parent's new building. The parent refused. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent loaned money for a specific purpose\u2014schooling. That's a significant gesture, especially since they didn't want the kids to switch to public school. The daughter and husband later repaid the parent's job by having the husband do electrical work. The daughter is now asking for forgiveness of some debt in exchange for that work. The parent refused.\n\nNow, the key points here are the nature of the loan and the expectation of repayment. If the parent made it clear that the loan was a loan and not a gift, then expecting repayment is reasonable. The daughter is trying to use the husband's work (the electrical work) as a form of payment, which the parent might not have considered when making the loan. But the parent is saying that they didn't agree to forgive the debt because of the work.\n\nThe parent might be in the right here if the loan was intended as a loan from the start. However, if the parent had any expectations of forgiveness, maybe they should have communicated that. But since they didn't, and the daughter is now trying to negotiate forgiveness after the fact, the parent's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. On the other hand, the daughter's husband did contribute work, so maybe the parent could have considered that as partial repayment. However, the parent might not have agreed to that arrangement initially.\n\nAnother angle: family dynamics. Sometimes, in family loans, there's an expectation of flexibility. But if the parent was clear that it was a loan, then expecting repayment is fair. The daughter is perhaps trying to renegotiate terms after the fact, which might not be fair to the parent.\n\nAlso, the husband's work was for the parent's project. The parent might have expected that the work was a separate matter, possibly as a favor or separate payment. If the parent didn't offer to compensate the husband for the electrical work, maybe the daughter is trying to use that as a way to get the parent to reduce the debt.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the parent had no prior agreement to forgive part of the loan, then they aren't in the wrong by declining. The daughter's request is coming after the fact. The parent might be justified in expecting repayment as per the original terms of the loan.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
