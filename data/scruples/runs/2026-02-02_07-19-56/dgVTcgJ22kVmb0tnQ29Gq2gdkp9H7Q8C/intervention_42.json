He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt.\n\nFirst, the facts: The author loaned over $10,000 to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in parochial school after they had to switch to public due to financial issues. The daughter later got a job, and when the author asked for repayment, the daughter and her husband offered to forgive some of the debt because the son-in-law (the husband) did electrical work for the author's new building.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they provided a loan with the expectation of repayment. Loans typically come with an understanding that the money is to be paid back, especially if there's no prior agreement about forgiveness. The author might see it as their right to expect full repayment, especially since they went out of their way to help in a time of need.\n\nFrom the daughter's perspective, they were in a tough spot financially, the son-in-law did some work for the author, and asking for forgiveness makes sense as a gesture of gratitude. They might feel that since the husband contributed to the author's project, some repayment was already made in the form of labor.\n\nBut here's the key point: Was the original loan a gift or a loan? The author called it a loan, so if there was no agreement to forgive part of it, the author isn't obligated. However, if there was an expectation that the loan would be forgiven as a gesture of thanks, that's different. The story says the author loaned the money to prevent the kids from switching schools, which was an act of goodwill. Now, when repayment is requested, the daughter is asking for forgiveness because her husband helped the author.\n\nIn many cases, family loans can be ambiguous. But if the author made it clear it was a loan, not a gift, then they aren't in the wrong for expecting full repayment. The daughter might be in the wrong for assuming part of the debt could be forgiven based on the husband's work, unless that was part of the original agreement.\n\nHowever, the husband's work was done after the loan was given. If the author didn't agree to forgive the loan in exchange for the work, then the daughter's request is an after-the-fact attempt to adjust the terms. That could be seen as unfair if there was no prior agreement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They provided a loan with the expectation of repayment. The daughter and son-in-law might have felt grateful and wanted to adjust the terms, but without an initial agreement, the author has the right to expect full payment. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
