He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a parent loaning money to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in a private school. The parent then built a building, and the son-in-law did the electrical work. When the parent asks for the loan back, the daughter wants some forgiven because her husband helped. The author says no, and now people are asking if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent loaned money intending for the kids to stay in school. That's a significant gesture, possibly out of love or concern for their grandchildren's education. Now the daughter is asking for forgiveness because the husband helped build the pool house. The parent might feel that the loan was a business transaction and not something to be forgiven, especially since the husband's help was part of his job anyway (since he's an electrician). \n\nBut wait, family loans can be tricky. If the parent didn't specify it as a loan with interest or repayment terms, maybe there was an expectation of some leniency. Also, the husband's work on the building\u2014was that paid for? If the parent paid the husband for the electrical work, then the husband's help is a separate transaction. If he was just helping as a favor, maybe that's different. But the parent might argue that the two are separate issues: the loan for the school and the electrical work. \n\nForgiveness of debt is a personal choice. The parent isn't obligated to forgive anything, but the daughter is asking because the husband helped. Is the parent in the wrong by not forgiving? It depends on the context. If the parent expected the debt to be repaid in full, then no. But maybe the parent felt the debt was a gift in the first place, and the daughter isn't asking to repay the full amount. However, the parent explicitly said it was a loan, so they might be justified in expecting repayment. \n\nAnother angle: the daughter was laid off, which is a hardship. The parent helped to keep the kids in school. Now that the daughter has a job, she's trying to repay. The parent might be strict about repayment to set a precedent or to teach responsibility. The daughter's request is based on the husband's help, which the parent might see as a separate matter. \n\nI'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they made a loan and are asking for it back. However, some might argue that the parent should show more flexibility given the family context. But since the parent is clear about it being a loan and not a gift, refusing forgiveness isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
