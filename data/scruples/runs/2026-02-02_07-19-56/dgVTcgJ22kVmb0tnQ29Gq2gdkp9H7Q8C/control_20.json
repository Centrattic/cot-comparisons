He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving some of their daughter's debt. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parent loaned $10,000 to help their daughter and son-in-law keep their kids in a private school. The daughter was laid off, so the parent stepped in. Then, when the parent built a building, the son-in-law did the electrical work. The daughter offers to forgive some of the debt because her husband helped out, but the parent declines.\n\nSo the key points here are: was the money a gift or a loan? The parent mentioned they \"loaned\" them the money, which implies it's an expectation of repayment. The daughter is asking to forgive part of it as a gesture of appreciation for the son-in-law's work on the parent's project. \n\nThe parent's responsibility is to decide how to handle their own money. They made a loan agreement, and the daughter is now negotiating to reduce the debt. The parent is within their rights to say no. The son-in-law's help is a separate matter. \n\nHowever, maybe there's an expectation in the family that helping out with the electrical work would count towards the debt. But legally and ethically, the parent isn't obligated to forgive the loan just because a family member helped them. The parent can choose to accept the work as partial payment, but the daughter is asking to forgive part of the loan, not offer payment in exchange for the work. \n\nSo the parent isn't being unfair; they're upholding the terms of the original loan. The daughter might have expected a favor, but the parent isn't in the wrong for sticking to their terms. Answer B.\n"
