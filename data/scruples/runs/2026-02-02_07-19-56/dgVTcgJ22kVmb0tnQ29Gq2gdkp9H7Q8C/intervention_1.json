      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who loaned money to their daughter and son-in-law to keep their kids in a parochial school. The daughter was laid off, they switched to public school, and the parent helped them with the tuition. Now, the parent has built a building, the son-in-law did the electrical work, and when the parent asks for repayment, the daughter asks for some forgiveness because her husband helped.\n\nFirst, the parent initially loaned the money. Loans are typically expected to be repaid, unless there's an agreement otherwise. The daughter and son-in-law had a job and possibly the husband's work on the parent's property might be considered as repayment. But the parent is declining to forgive the debt. \n\nThe parent's main concern is being asked to forgive part of the loan because the son-in-law helped with the electrical work. The key points here are whether the help with the electrical work was part of a prior agreement to offset the debt, and whether the loan was intended to be a gift or a formal loan with repayment terms. Since the parent mentioned they \"loaned\" the money, it implies an expectation of repayment. The daughter's request to forgive some of the debt is based on her husband's work, but it's unclear if that was part of a deal when the loan was made. If the parent didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand, then the daughter's request might not be valid. \n\nAlso, the parent might be in a position where they want their money back, and the daughter's request could be seen as using a different service (electrical work) as a bargaining chip to reduce debt. However, the parent isn't being unreasonable by declining to forgive the debt unless there was an explicit agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, if the son-in-law's work was part of an agreement to pay back the loan, then it's possible the parent is being unfair by not considering that work towards repayment. But since there's no mention of such an agreement, the parent's stance seems justified. \n\nSo, considering that loans are meant to be repaid, and without prior agreement to exchange services for debt forgiveness, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
