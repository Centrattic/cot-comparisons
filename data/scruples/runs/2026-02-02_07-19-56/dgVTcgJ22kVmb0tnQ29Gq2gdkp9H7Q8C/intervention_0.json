He is an electrician and she was in medical. She was laid off and they decided to take the kids out of parochial school and put them into public. I didn't want to see that happen so I loaned them over $10,000 for tuition, book, lunch,etc so the kids could stay in their school.\n\nI recently built a building behind my home. Outdoor kitchen/pool house type. My SIL did all of the electrical. My daughter ended up finding a job and I asked the status of my money. She asked how much they owed and I told them the exact amount I loaned them. She then asked about forgiving some of it because her husband helped me out. I declined.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is the asshole for not forgiving part of their daughter's debt. The parent loaned over $10k to keep the kids in parochial school after the daughter was laid off. Now the daughter wants some forgiveness because her husband (the parent's son-in-law) helped with the electrical work on the parent's new building.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to help the kids stay in school. They made a loan, which is a financial agreement. The daughter is asking to reduce the debt because her husband helped them. But the parent didn't promise forgiveness when they made the loan. The key here is whether the parent had any prior agreement or expectation of repayment. Since the parent asked for the money back after the daughter found a job, it seems like they expected repayment from the start.\n\nThe husband's help with the electrical work might be a separate issue. If the SIL did the work for free or at a discount, maybe the parent feels that's compensation. But the parent is being asked to forgive part of the debt because of that. However, the parent isn't obligated to forgive the debt just because the SIL provided services. The original loan was a separate transaction.\n\nThe parent's refusal could be seen as sticking to their word, which is commendable. But some might argue that family help should be considered in a more flexible way. However, since the parent didn't agree to forgive it upfront and the daughter only asked after the husband helped, the parent might be in the right to hold them to the original agreement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
