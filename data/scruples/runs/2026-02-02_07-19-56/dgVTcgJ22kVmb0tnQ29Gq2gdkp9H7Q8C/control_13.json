      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not forgiving their daughter's debt. Let me read the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo the parent loaned over $10k to their daughter and son-in-law to keep the kids in parochial school after the daughter was laid off. Now, the daughter's husband did some electrical work for the parent's new building. The daughter asked to forgive some of the debt because her husband helped, but the parent said no. The parent is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the parent lent money as a loan, not a gift. That's important. Loans are supposed to be repaid unless agreed otherwise. The daughter might have expected it to be a gift, but the parent framed it as a loan. So the parent is within their rights to ask for repayment.\n\nThen there's the son-in-law's work on the parent's building. The daughter is asking to forgive debt because her husband helped. But the parent didn't ask for help, and the son-in-law did it on his own. So maybe there's a mix-up here. The parent might feel that the help from the son-in-law is separate from the loan. The parent could be seen as not appreciative, but legally, they're not obligated to forgive the debt. \n\nBut culturally, family loans can be tricky. If the parent intended it as a gift, then not forgiving it later might be seen as stingy. However, the parent clearly said it was a loan. The daughter might not have understood that, but the parent's stance is that it's a loan. So the parent isn't in the wrong for not forgiving part of it. \n\nAnother angle: the parent helped the daughter out of a specific need (keeping kids in school). The daughter repaid by finding a job, then asked to reduce the debt because her husband helped. The parent's refusal could be seen as not considering the family situation, but again, the parent isn't legally bound. \n\nSo the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong. They followed through on a loan agreement, and the daughter might have had different expectations, but the parent's actions are justified.\n"
