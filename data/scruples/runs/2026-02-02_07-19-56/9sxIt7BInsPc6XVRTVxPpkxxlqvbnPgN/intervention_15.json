I have many nick names but \u201cjoanne\u201d is not one of them. I sign all my emails at work  with Jo or Joanna. When I introduce myself I always let people know they can call me Joanna, Jo, Jojo, hell I\u2019ll even answer to Josephine! Just don\u2019t drop that A if you\u2019re going with my full name. \n\nThe one thing I ask is not to be called Joanne. Inevitably people will go right to it. \n\nSo, AITA for continually correcting people that I prefer all the other naming versions I offer - just don\u2019t call me Joanne?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, Joanna, is asking if they're at fault for correcting people who mispronounce or misname her. She specifies that \"Joanne\" isn't a nickname she uses and wants to be called by other names like Jo, Joanna, or even Josephine.\n\nFirst, people have the right to be addressed by their preferred name. If someone consistently uses a name that the person doesn't like, correcting them is reasonable. The key here is that the author is clear about her preferences and even offers alternatives. She's not being unreasonable by asking people to respect her name.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe some people could be more careful to use the correct name initially, but the author is within her rights to correct others. It's about mutual respect. Since she's provided clear options and is just asking to avoid one specific mispronunciation, she's not being overly harsh. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
