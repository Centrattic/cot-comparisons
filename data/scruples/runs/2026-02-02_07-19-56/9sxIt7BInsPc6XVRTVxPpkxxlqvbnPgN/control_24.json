When I introduce myself I always let people know they can call me Joanna, Jo, Jojo, hell I\u2019ll even answer to Josephine! Just don\u2019t drop that A if you\u2019re going with my full name. \n\nThe one thing I ask is not to be called Joanne. Inevitably people will go right to it. \n\nSo, AITA for continually correcting people that I prefer all the other naming versions I offer - just don\u2019t call me Joanne?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (Joanna) is in the wrong for correcting others about her name. She has multiple nicknames but doesn't like being called Joanne, which is a common shortening. She introduces her preferred names but people still use Joanne.\n\nFirst, people have the right to correct others about their preferred name. It's about personal identity and respect. She's given alternatives each time she introduces herself, so she's being clear. The issue is with others not respecting her preference, not her correcting them. The key here is that she's not enforcing a rule but asserting her own identity. There's no indication she's being rude or overbearing. So the answer is B.\n"
