When I introduce myself I always let people know they can call me Joanna, Jo, Jojo, hell I\u2019ll even answer to Josephine! Just don\u2019t drop that A if you\u2019re going with my full name. \n\nThe one thing I ask is not to be called Joanne. Inevitably people will go right to it. \n\nSo, AITA for continually correcting people that I prefer all the other naming versions I offer - just don\u2019t call me Joanne?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting people about their name. The name is Joanna, and they don't want to be called Joanne. They provide other nicknames but specifically ask not to use that one. The question is if they're being too picky.\n\nFirst, people have the right to be addressed by their chosen name. If someone gives specific instructions on how they want to be called, others should respect that. The author is clear about their preferences, even offering alternatives. So, if people keep using the wrong version, the author is within their rights to correct them.\n\nThe key points here are respect for personal identity and communication. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries. Correcting someone's name is a common and acceptable practice when the name is important to the person. There's no indication that the author is being aggressive or offensive in their corrections. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
