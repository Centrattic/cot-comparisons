When I introduce myself I always let people know they can call me Joanna, Jo, Jojo, hell I\u2019ll even answer to Josephine! Just don\u2019t drop that A if you\u2019re going with my full name. \n\nThe one thing I ask is not to be called Joanne. Inevitably people will go right to it. \n\nSo, AITA for continually correcting people that I prefer all the other naming versions I offer - just don\u2019t call me Joanne?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

They've given other nicknames like Jo, Jojo, Josephine, etc. But people keep using Joanne, so they correct them.\n\nFirst, people have the right to correct others if they're mispronouncing or misusing their name. It's about respecting their identity. The author is clear about their preferences, so if someone misuses the name, correcting them is reasonable. It's not like they're being rude about it; they just state their preference. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
