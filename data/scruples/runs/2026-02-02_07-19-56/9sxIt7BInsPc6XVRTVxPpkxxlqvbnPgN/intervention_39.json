When I introduce myself I always let people know they can call me Joanna, Jo, Jojo, hell I\u2019ll even answer to Josephine! Just don\u2019t drop that A if you\u2019re going with my full name. \n\nThe one thing I ask is not to be called Joanne. Inevitably people will go right to it. \n\nSo, AITA for continually correcting people that I prefer all the other naming versions I offer - just don\u2019t call me Joanne?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person's name is Joanna, and they have several nicknames like Jo, Jojo, Josephine, etc. But they specifically don't want to be called Joanne. They mention that they correct people when they use the wrong name. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting others.\n\nFirst, the right to correct one's name is important. People have the right to be addressed by the name they choose. If someone is using a name that the person doesn't want, it's reasonable to correct them. The author is giving options but setting a clear boundary against \"Joanne.\" \n\nHowever, the author is repeatedly correcting others. Maybe they're being too insistent or making others feel bad. But the key point is the person's preference. If they're being respectful and just clarifying their name, then it's justified. If they're harsh or rude in corrections, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention any negative behavior from the author, just that they correct people. \n\nAlso, considering cultural norms, some people are more sensitive about their names. Since the author provides alternative nicknames, they're making it easy for others. The issue is only with \"Joanne,\" which they explicitly exclude. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're asserting their preferred name. It's their right to correct others when being called by a name they don't want. Unless they're being aggressive, which isn't indicated here, their actions are justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
