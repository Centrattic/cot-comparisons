I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who isn't a mother but is an undiagnosed autistic adult, is nudging their friend to get her child evaluated because they notice developmental delays. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child. The author feels compelled to suggest evaluation but is trying to be gentle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, so their concern comes from personal experience. They want to help, not to criticize. The friend is already complaining about the child's behavior, which the author links to possible developmental issues. The author is being cautious, not forceful, and is framing it as an option. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be overstepping by making assumptions based on their own experience. But on the other hand, they have a genuine concern for the child's well-being. The key here is the intent and the approach. The author isn't being confrontational, just gently suggesting an option. The friend's resistance could be due to personal trauma (losing a child in a legal battle), which adds complexity. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting from a place of care and is respectful, even if their input is unsolicited, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if they're being pushy or making the friend feel judged, that would be the case. The author states they are trying not to be forward. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent is to help and the approach is gentle. But there's a line where non-parents shouldn't dictate to parents. However, the author is suggesting, not demanding. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they're acting with good intentions and being respectful, even if their advice is unsolicited. The friend's resistance is valid, but the author's concern is based on genuine care.\n"
