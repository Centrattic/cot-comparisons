I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author of the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, showing developmental delays. The author, who is autistic and undiagnosed until later, relates to the potential struggles the child might face. The author is concerned because the friend keeps complaining about the child's behavior but refuses to consider evaluations. The friend might be in denial or scared due to past experiences, like losing a child in a legal battle.\n\nThe author is trying to approach this gently, not being pushy, but just offering the idea as an option. They mention they don't want to lecture or force anything. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nNow, to evaluate this, I need to consider intent, the context, and the potential outcomes. The author's concern is genuine, based on personal experience. They're not acting out of malice but care. The friend, on the other hand, might feel attacked if the author is too insistent. However, since the author is being gentle and suggesting evaluation as an option, they're not overstepping. It's important to note that the author is not a parent nor an expert, but their intention is to help.\n\nIn situations where a child's development is a concern, especially when the parent is in denial, friends or family might step in. However, it's a delicate balance. The key here is that the author is not being confrontational. They acknowledge that the friend might have pride issues or fears, and they're approaching it with care. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is prioritizing the child's well-being based on their own negative experiences. While they should respect the parent's autonomy, they also have a moral concern for the child's future. Since they're not forcing the issue but gently suggesting it, it's a reasonable approach. \n\nPotential pitfalls: If the author pushes too hard, they risk damaging the friendship or making the friend defensive. However, since they're being cautious and not lecturing, it's a valid concern expressed appropriately. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're acting from a place of care and concern, using their own experiences to guide their friend, while being respectful of the friend's feelings and circumstances.\n"
