I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a friend of a mother whose child is almost 3 and not speaking, and the author is nudging the friend to get the child evaluated. The author isn't a parent themselves and isn't a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and seeing how that affected their life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned because their friend is complaining about the child's behavior, and the child isn't speaking yet. The friend is resistant, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is trying to be gentle and not pushy, but they want to suggest evaluation and therapy. The friend might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle), which makes her scared of losing this child.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the author is acting out of concern. They have a valid reason, given their own experience with being undiagnosed and the impact it had. They're not forcing the issue but trying to gently mention the benefits. This seems like a well-meaning attempt to help, especially since the child's age is critical for early intervention. The author is not a professional, but they're not saying there's a diagnosis, just suggesting evaluation as an option.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that the author is overstepping. The author isn't a parent or a professional, so maybe they don't have the right to question her parenting. Also, the mother's resistance could be due to protective instincts or fear. If the author is persistent, it might come off as judgmental, even if their intentions are good. However, the author says they're not trying to be forward and are trying to be gentle, so maybe they're not being pushy.\n\nBut then again, the child's well-being is a priority. If the child is not meeting developmental milestones and the mother is in denial, the author's concern is valid. The author is trying to open the mother's eyes to a possibility without forcing her hand. So even if the mother is defensive, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to help.\n\nI think the key here is the author's approach. They're not being aggressive, they're trying to be a supportive friend, and they have a legitimate concern based on their own experience. The mother's pride and fear are complicating factors, but the author isn't the one causing the issue. The mother's resistance might be due to her own issues, but the author's intention is to help, not to criticize. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
