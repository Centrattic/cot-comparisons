I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author repeatedly nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues, even though the friend is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is not a parent or a medical professional but has personal experience with being undiagnosed and the challenges that came with it. Their friend's child shows signs that could indicate a developmental delay or disorder, but the friend is dismissive, possibly due to pride or fear from a past loss (losing her last child in a legal battle).\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions. The author is concerned for the child's well-being, wanting to avoid the same struggles they faced without a diagnosis. They're approaching the friend gently, not forcing the issue, but suggesting evaluation as an option. The question is whether this is overstepping or if it's justified concern.\n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted with good intentions and followed appropriate social boundaries. The author isn't being pushy but is instead trying to offer support. The friend's resistance might be due to personal fears, and the author is trying to be respectful by not lecturing. \n\nHowever, there's a line between being concerned and overstepping. Since the author isn't a parent or professional, advising on medical evaluations could be seen as inappropriate. But given the potential impact on the child's life, some might argue that the concern is valid. The author is also aware of their own lack of knowledge about motherhood, which shows they're being cautious.\n\nThe friend's emotional state and past experiences add complexity. The author is trying to be sensitive, which is commendable. The community might weigh the child's potential needs against the parent's autonomy. In many cases, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, but if a child's well-being is at risk, others might feel compelled to act.\n\nIn similar WIBTA posts, the advice often balances respecting someone's autonomy with the urgency of potential child welfare issues. If there's a genuine concern about a child's development, it's sometimes considered responsible to encourage evaluation, even if it's uncomfortable. So, the author's intentions are good, and they're approaching it respectfully. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not the Asshole).\n"
