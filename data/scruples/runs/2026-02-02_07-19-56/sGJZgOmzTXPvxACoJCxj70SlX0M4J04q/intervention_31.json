I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a friend who's nudging another friend to get her child evaluated because they suspect the child might have developmental issues, maybe autism or something else. The friend is resistant, saying there's nothing wrong, and the author is concerned because they were undiagnosed and it affected their life.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're not a parent and don't know much about motherhood. But they do have personal experience with an autism diagnosis later in life. They see their friend complaining about her child's behavior and think it's similar to the signs they had. The friend, however, is in denial and possibly scared due to past experiences with losing a child in a legal battle.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by gently suggesting an evaluation. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to help a friend's child who might be struggling. Early intervention can be crucial for developmental issues, so their concern is valid. They're not forcing the issue but gently mentioning the benefits, which seems respectful. They also acknowledge that the friend might have pride issues or fears, so they're trying to approach it sensitively.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is the parent, and it's her decision whether to seek evaluations. The author is not a professional, so they might be overstepping by making assumptions about the child's needs. Even with good intentions, pushing for evaluations could be seen as intrusive or judgmental. The parent might feel that the author is questioning her parenting abilities, which can be a sensitive issue, especially if she's already dealing with past trauma.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions versus the potential impact. The author is concerned and wants to help, but they need to respect the parent's autonomy. The parent might have valid reasons for not seeking evaluations, such as fear of losing custody again. The author's approach is described as gentle and not lecturing, which is a good sign. But even gentle nudging can be perceived as pushy if the parent isn't ready to hear it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is overstepping. Since they're a friend and not a professional, their role is to support, not to make decisions for the parent. However, if they genuinely see signs that could benefit from early intervention, it's reasonable to express concern. The line is thin here. The author might not be in the wrong if they're approaching it with care and respect, but there's a risk of being perceived as intrusive. The parent's feelings and past experiences are important factors. The author is trying to offer help without being forceful, so they might not be in the wrong, but they need to be cautious about how they present it.\n"
