I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend whose child isn't speaking and shows developmental delays, and the author keeps nudging the friend to get an evaluation. The author isn't a parent, which they acknowledge, but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, which affected their life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned for their friend's child and is trying to get them to get help. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child. The author wants to mention the benefits of evaluation but is trying not to be pushy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate.\n\nI should think about the intention here. The author's intention is to help, but the method might be problematic. The friend is already complaining about the child's behavior, and the author is pointing out possible issues. But the friend is defensive, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is trying to gently suggest evaluation, but maybe they're overstepping by pushing their own experience onto the situation.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to be cautious not to lecture. There's a balance between caring and overstepping. The friend's resistance might be due to personal trauma, as mentioned with losing a child. The author's concern is valid, but the approach could be seen as intrusive if not handled carefully.\n\nBut is the author wrong? It's a judgment call. On one hand, they're trying to help, which is good. On the other hand, they might not have the right to push their friend into something that's not wanted. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. If the author is persistent without respecting the friend's boundaries, that could be the issue. However, the author says they're not forcing anything and just want the friend to consider it. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to respect the autonomy of the parent. Even if the author believes the child needs evaluation, the parent has the final say. The author's role is to express concern but not to pressure. If the author is nudging repeatedly, maybe that's where the line is crossed. However, the author claims they're being gentle and not forward.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intent is good, but the action of persistently nudging might be crossing a boundary, especially if the friend is resistant for valid reasons. However, the author isn't forcing anything, just suggesting. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether the nudging is respectful. Given that the author is trying to be gentle and not forward, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the nudging is seen as prying or overstepping, then they might be.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is not a parent, but using their own experience to express concern. If the friend is resistant, the author should respect that unless there's an immediate danger. Since there's no mention of the child being in immediate danger, the author's concern is valid but might not be their place to push. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. The question is whether they are. Considering the situation, the author's intent is good, but the action might not be. Alternatively, if the author is just gently suggesting without being pushy, maybe not. But the friend's resistance is significant. Hmm. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to help and not forcing anything, but the line is thin. However, if the author is persistently nudging despite the friend's resistance, maybe that's where the problem is. The original question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author is not forcing but just suggesting, and the friend is the one who is resistant, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
