I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to evaluate her child. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the OP is a non-mother with no experience in motherhood but is autistic and has lived with undiagnosed autism, which affected their life. Their friend's 3-year-old isn't speaking and shows developmental delays. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but denies any issues when asked about evaluation. The OP is concerned because they remember their own struggles with being undiagnosed and want to help, but they're worried about being an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the OP's intentions versus the friend's autonomy. The OP is trying to help, based on their own experience, but the friend might feel that the advice is unsolicited or intrusive. However, the OP is being gentle and not pushy, just suggesting the benefits of evaluation and therapy. The friend's resistance could stem from pride or fear of losing another child, as mentioned. \n\nI need to consider if the OP is overstepping. Since the child's well-being is at stake, the OP's concern is valid. However, they are not a parent or a professional, so maybe they shouldn't be the one making that call. But they are trying to offer support, not force anything. The line between helping and interfering is thin here.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the term is subjective. If the OP's approach is respectful and non-judgmental, they might not be in the wrong. The friend is the one who has the final say in her child's care. The OP is advocating for the child, which could be seen as compassionate. But parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, so even if the OP is right about the child's needs, it's the parent's choice.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? If they're gently encouraging and not forcing, maybe not. They have good intentions and are trying to share information. The friend's reaction might be due to personal fears, not the OP's approach. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the OP is acting out of concern without being overbearing. However, there's a risk of overstepping, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
