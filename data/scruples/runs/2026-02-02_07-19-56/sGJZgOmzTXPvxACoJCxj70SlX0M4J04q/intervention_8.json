I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author of the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The situation involves the author's concern about the child's development and their friend's resistance, especially given the friend's past trauma with losing a child.\n\nFirst, the author is not a parent or a medical professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and seeing how that affected their life. They're concerned because their friend's child is not speaking at almost 3 and shows developmental delays. The friend dismisses the idea of evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear from a past legal battle involving her other child.\n\nThe key points here are the intention and the approach. The author is trying to help, not to pry or judge. They mention wanting to be gentle and not pushy. However, the friend might feel that someone is questioning her parenting or her child's well-being, which can be a sensitive topic. The author's concern is valid because early intervention can be crucial for developmental issues. But they're not a medical professional, so they can't diagnose, only suggest evaluation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intentions are good\u2014they want the child to get support if needed. However, repeatedly nudging someone on such a personal and sensitive issue, especially when the parent is resistant, could come across as overstepping. The friend's refusal might stem from fear or past trauma, and the author needs to respect her autonomy unless there's a clear risk of harm. In cases where a child's welfare is at stake, sometimes it's appropriate to voice concerns through the proper channels, but the author is doing it through their friend, not a professional. \n\nSo, if the author is doing it gently and not forcing the issue, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But if they're persistently pushing despite resistance, that could be problematic. The answer might depend on the balance between the child's potential need for help and the parent's rights. Since the author is not a parent and isn't forcing the issue, but just suggesting, it's a tricky situation. However, the line between concern and overstepping can be thin. Given the context, I think the author is not in the wrong because their intention is to help and they're approaching it carefully.\n"
