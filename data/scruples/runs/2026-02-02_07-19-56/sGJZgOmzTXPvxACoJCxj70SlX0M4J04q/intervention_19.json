I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author isn't a parent or an expert in child development, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and how that affected their life. Their friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, showing signs that might indicate a developmental issue. The author has noticed these signs and is concerned, wanting to encourage the friend to seek evaluation. However, the friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child after a legal battle.\n\nThe author is trying to gently suggest evaluations and therapy without being pushy. They\u2019re not forcing the issue but want the friend to consider it as an option. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nOn one hand, the author has good intentions, trying to help based on their own experiences. They\u2019re not a professional, but they're using their personal insights to support a friend. On the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially since the author isn't a parent or an expert. It's important to respect the parent's autonomy, even if they're making a decision that another person might disagree with.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, if they're approaching the topic with genuine concern, without being confrontational, and offering support rather than judgment, it's more about the manner in which they're bringing it up. The author mentions trying not to be forward and not wanting to lecture, so they're being considerate. However, the line between concern and overstepping can be thin. Since the friend is resistant, maybe the author should be cautious, but the intent is positive. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The key points are the author's good intentions, the non-confrontational approach, and the friend's own fears. The author is advocating for the child's well-being, which is a common concern among friends. Unless the author is being pushy or dismissive, they're probably not the asshole. So I think the answer is B.\n"
