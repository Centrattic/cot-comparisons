I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend whose child isn't meeting developmental milestones, and the author keeps nudging them to get an evaluation.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about the child's development. They mention that the child is almost 3 and not speaking, and has other symptoms. The friend has complaints about the child's behavior but denies there's a problem. The author's motivation is to help, based on their own experience of being undiagnosed and the impact it had on their life.\n\nSo, the question is: Is it wrong for the author to gently suggest evaluation? Well, the key points here are the author's intentions and the approach. They say they're not prying, they're trying to be gentle, not forward, and they respect the friend's pride and fears. They don't want to force anything, just present it as an option.\n\nIn terms of ethics, urging someone to seek help for a child's potential developmental issues is generally seen as a positive action, especially when the child's well-being is at stake. The author isn't being confrontational but is instead motivated by empathy and a desire to prevent the child from suffering as they did. The friend's reluctance might stem from fear or denial, which the author acknowledges, so the approach is respectful.\n\nHowever, one might argue that overstepping could happen if the author is pushing too hard. But the scenario says the author is \"gently\" mentioning the benefits, not pressuring. There's a balance between concern and respecting boundaries. Since the author isn't being aggressive and is acknowledging the friend's possible fears, their actions seem justified.\n\nAlso, the child's age is crucial. At 3, speech and development are critical milestones. Early intervention can make a significant difference. The author's concern is valid given that, and their intention is to advocate for the child's possible needs. They're not diagnosing but suggesting a professional evaluation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their intentions are good, their approach is respectful, and they're motivated by a desire to help. The answer should be B (No).\n"
