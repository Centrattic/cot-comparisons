I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a non-mother who's not a parent but has personal experience as an undiagnosed autistic person. They have a friend whose 3-year-old child isn't speaking and shows developmental delays. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but refuses to get an evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear of losing custody after losing a previous child in a legal battle. The author wants to nudge the friend towards considering evaluation and therapy without being pushy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's motivation is concern for the child's well-being, based on their own experiences with undiagnosed autism affecting their life. They're trying to be gentle and not forceful. The friend, however, is defensive and in denial. The author's approach is to mention the benefits without lecturing, which seems respectful.\n\nBut wait, are they overstepping? The friend might feel that the author isn't qualified to comment on parenting, especially as a non-parent. However, the author has valid personal experience with developmental issues. The line here is delicate. The key factors are intent and method. The author is not being aggressive, just gently suggesting an option. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or pride, not the author's approach. \n\nAlso, the author is not making accusations or forcing the issue but offering support. In such cases, the common advice is that expressing concern in a non-judgmental way isn't being an asshole. The author's actions are aimed at helping, not criticizing. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong). They're acting from a place of care and empathy, using their own experience to advocate for the child's possible needs without being pushy.\n"
