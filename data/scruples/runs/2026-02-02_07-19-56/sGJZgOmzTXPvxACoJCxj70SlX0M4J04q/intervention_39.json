I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The situation is that the friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author, who's undiagnosed autistic, is concerned because they know how being undiagnosed affected them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is expressing concern for the child's well-being. But where's the line between helping and overstepping? The friend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially since the author isn't a parent or a professional. However, the author is doing it gently, not prying. \n\nThe key points here are the child's potential needs versus the mother's autonomy. The mother might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child). The author's intent is good, but maybe they're not considering the mother's emotional state. But is it wrong to suggest something that could help the child? If the author is being respectful and not pushing too hard, maybe it's not wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions trying not to be forward. The mother has the right to make decisions about her child, so the author isn't forcing anything. They're just offering an option. So, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the concern is valid and the approach respectful. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're acting from a place of care and want the best for the child. The mother's pride and fear are her own issues, but the author's intention is positive. So, answer B.\n"
