I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The scenario is that the friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and shows developmental delays. The author, who is autistic and undiagnosed until later, feels concerned and wants the friend to consider an evaluation. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent of the author. They mention they're not trying to pry or lecture but genuinely care, given their own experience with being undiagnosed. Their motivation seems good. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe friend is the parent, so she has the ultimate responsibility for her child's well-being. The author is a friend stepping in, which can be a gray area. Even with good intentions, pushing someone else's child into evaluations without their consent might overstep. However, the author is suggesting it as an option, not forcing anything. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the parent's possible fear and past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle). The author acknowledges this, which shows they're aware of the sensitivity. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the key is whether the author is being inconsiderate or overbearing. The author says they're being gentle and not forward. If they're approaching it with care and respect, maybe they're not wrong. But there's a risk of causing offense if the parent feels judged. \n\nLegally and ethically, unless there's abuse or neglect, other people can't force parents to get their kids evaluated. The author is within their rights to express concern, but the parent has the right to make the decision. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong because they're acting out of concern and aren't overstepping by making the decision for the parent. However, the line is thin. If the nudging becomes persistent or judgmental, that's different. Here, the author is trying to be gentle. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're expressing a valid concern in a respectful way, even if the parent isn't receptive.\n"
