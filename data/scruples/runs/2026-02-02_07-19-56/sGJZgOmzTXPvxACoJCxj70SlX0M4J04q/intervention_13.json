I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author is concerned because they themselves were undiagnosed autistic and suffered as a result.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The friend is a parent, and the author is trying to influence her parenting decisions. While the author's intentions are good\u2014wanting to help the child and prevent future issues\u2014there's a line between offering support and overstepping. The key factors here are the author's lack of expertise in motherhood and the potential for the friend's defensiveness due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle and possible pride issues).\n\nThe author mentions they are gently nudging and not being confrontational, which is a positive. But the friend might perceive this as pressure or criticism, especially if she's already feeling vulnerable. The legal battle aspect adds another layer; the friend might fear that getting her child evaluated could lead to similar situations, making her resistant.\n\nHowever, the child's well-being is a critical factor. If the child indeed has developmental issues, early intervention can be beneficial. The author's concern is valid, but they need to approach it carefully without being judgmental. The question is whether the author is overstepping by repeatedly bringing it up, even if it's with good intentions.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help, which isn't inherently wrong. On the other hand, they might not be the best person to push for evaluations since they lack expertise in parenting or child development. The friend has the right to make her own decisions about her child, even if others disagree.\n\nIn terms of the community's typical response to WIBTA posts, they often emphasize respecting boundaries and not overstepping, unless there's a clear harm. Since the author is gently suggesting and not forcing, it's more about the intent versus the outcome. The author isn't in the wrong for caring and trying to help, but they should be cautious about how they approach it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intentions are good, and they're approaching it gently without overstepping. The parent's resistance is due to personal issues, not the author's actions. The author is trying to offer support, which is appropriate.\n"
