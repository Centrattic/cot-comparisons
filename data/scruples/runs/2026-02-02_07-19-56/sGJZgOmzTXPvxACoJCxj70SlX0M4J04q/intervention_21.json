I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about nudging a friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues.\n\nFirst, the author is not a mother but has experience with being undiagnosed autistic. They notice that their friend's child, almost 3, isn't speaking and has other symptoms. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but denies any issues. The author wants to suggest evaluation and therapy but is worried about coming across as pushy.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, what's the key here? The author is concerned about the child's well-being based on their own experience. They're trying to help but are being cautious to not be overbearing. The friend might have pride issues or fear of losing another child, making the situation sensitive.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're not a parent, but they have valid concerns. The child's age is a critical period for intervention. The author is approaching it gently, not forcing. But does that still count as wrong? Or is it reasonable to express concern when you see a child struggling?\n\nI think the author is trying to do good. They admit they don't know about motherhood but have personal experience that informs their concern. The friend's denial could be harmful if the child needs help. The author isn't prying but is offering a suggestion based on the friend's own complaints. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
