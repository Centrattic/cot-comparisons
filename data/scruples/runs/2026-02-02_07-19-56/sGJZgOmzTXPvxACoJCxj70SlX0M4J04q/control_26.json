I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about a friend whose child has developmental issues, and the author is nudging her to get an evaluation. The author is not a parent but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. The friend is resistant, maybe due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is overstepping. The author mentions they're not pushing too hard and are trying to be gentle. Their concern comes from a place of knowing how their own undiagnosed autism affected their life. They're not forcing anything but suggesting an option. The friend is the one making the decision, so the author isn't in the wrong for caring and offering advice.\n\nAlso, the friend is the one with the child, so it's her responsibility to decide what to do. The author isn't being confrontational, just sharing their perspective. The answer should be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
