I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing other developmental delays. The author isn't a parent but relates because they're undiagnosed autistic and suffered from being undiagnosed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is genuinely concerned about the child's well-being, based on their own experiences. They mention their friend is complaining about the child's behavior, which adds to the concern. The key points here are the author's intentions and the friend's reaction.\n\nThe author is trying to gently suggest evaluation, not being pushy. The friend might be defensive, maybe due to past experiences losing a child. The author isn't forcing anything but wants the friend to consider it. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're not a parent or expert, but they have a valid concern. The question is whether it's appropriate to bring up such a sensitive topic. Since the friend is already vocal about the child's issues, the author is pointing out a possible solution. \n\nHowever, the author should be cautious not to make assumptions. But the scenario here is that the friend is dismissing potential problems, which could harm the child. The author's motivation is to help, not to intrude. \n\nIn these situations, it's a balance between respecting the parent's decisions and advocating for the child. The author is doing the latter subtly. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're acting in the child's best interest without being aggressive.\n"
