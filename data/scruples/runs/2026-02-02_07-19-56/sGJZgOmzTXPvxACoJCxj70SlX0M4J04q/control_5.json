I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend whose child isn't speaking yet and shows developmental delays, but the friend refuses to get an evaluation. The author, who's not a parent but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, keeps nudging the friend about getting the child evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned because they see patterns that might indicate a need for evaluation. They mention their own experience being undiagnosed, which affected their life. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for trying to help? Well, the author isn't being aggressive, just gently suggesting. They acknowledge not being a parent and aren't lecturing, just sharing their perspective. The friend is the one not acting on concerns. The author's intention is to offer support and suggest an option, not to force anything. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to do the right thing by encouraging the friend to consider evaluations for the child's well-being. But there's a line between helping and overstepping. However, given that the author is approaching it gently and the friend's child might be in need, it seems the author is in the right. The answer should be B.\n"
