I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for nudging a friend about getting her child evaluated. The situation is complex because the author has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, which they believe affected their life negatively. They see similar behaviors in the friend's child and are concerned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't a parent or a professional, so they're not in a position to diagnose. But they're sharing their own experiences and suggesting an evaluation. The friend, on the other hand, is defensive, stating there's nothing wrong with her child. The author is trying to be gentle and not pushy, but the friend might feel criticized or accused.\n\nNow, the key factors are intention and method. The author's intention is to help, based on their own struggles. They want the child to get help if needed. But the method matters. Are they overstepping? The author mentions not wanting to lecture and being gentle, so maybe their approach is respectful. However, the friend's history with losing a child in a legal battle complicates things. She might be defensive because of past trauma, fearing another loss. The author's concern is valid, but they have to be careful not to add stress to the friend when she's already under pressure.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're doing it gently and not forcing the issue, maybe not. But they're not the parent, so they have to respect the friend's autonomy. The line between concern and overstepping can be thin. The author's actions might be well-meaning, but they need to be cautious not to impose their own experiences onto the friend's situation. However, given that they're sharing their own experiences and not being confrontational, they might still be in the right. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong if they're approaching it with care and respect.\n"
