I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing custody.\n\nFirst, the author has no experience in motherhood but draws from their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic person. They're trying to help based on genuine concern, not to pry. The key points here are intent and method. The author is suggesting evaluation gently, not being pushy, and wants their friend to consider it as an option.\n\nNow, ethical considerations: Is it wrong to express concern for someone else's child's well-being? The author isn't forcing anything, just offering information. They acknowledge the friend's feelings and the context of her past (losing a child). The main issue is whether the concern is valid. Developmental delays in a 3-year-old can be serious, and early intervention is crucial. The author is acting in what they believe is the child's best interest.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say it's not the author's place to intervene, that the mother should make that decision. But given the child's potential to benefit from early help, the author's concern is well-meaning. The method is described as gentle and not lecturing, which reduces the chance of being an asshole.\n\nAlso, the author is aware of their own lack of expertise but is sharing a personal experience that relates to the issue. They're not medical professionals, but they're raising a valid point about possible evaluations. The mother's resistance could be due to fear or denial, which the author is trying to navigate carefully.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intentions are good, the approach seems respectful, and the concern is for the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
