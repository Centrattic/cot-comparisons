I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost three, not speaking, showing developmental delays, and the friend refuses to consider evaluation. The author isn't a parent, isn't an expert, but based on their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic adult, they feel compelled to gently suggest an evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't pushing aggressively but is trying to be gentle. They acknowledge their lack of expertise and the friend's possible pride and emotional barriers. The key points here are the intentions and the approach. The author is motivated by concern, not judgment, and is trying to share their own experience as a cautionary tale rather than lecturing.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is in a vulnerable situation, having lost a child in a legal battle. This might make her defensive or resistant to any suggestion that could be perceived as criticism. So, the author's nudging might be seen as helpful or intrusive. The line between helpful concern and overstepping can be thin here.\n\nBut the author is not forcing the issue. They're offering support and information, not demanding action. They're also aware of the sensitivity and trying to approach it without being pushy. The question is whether this is the right approach. Since the child's well-being is at stake, the author's intentions are genuinely to help, even if the friend is resistant. So, from a moral standpoint, it's not about being right or wrong but about the balance between concern and respecting autonomy.\n\nIn similar situations, people often advise that it's not wrong to express concern when a child's development is a red flag. However, the manner in which it's done is crucial. The author is being cautious, which suggests they're trying not to be the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
