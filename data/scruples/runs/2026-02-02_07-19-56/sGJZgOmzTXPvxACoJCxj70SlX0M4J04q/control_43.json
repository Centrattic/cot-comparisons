I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend whose child is almost three and not speaking, showing signs of developmental issues. The author, who is undiagnosed autistic, is concerned and wants to nudge their friend to get an evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is not a parent or expert in child development but is speaking from their own experience with being undiagnosed and how that affected their life. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear from a past legal battle. The author wants to gently suggest evaluations and therapy without being pushy.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to help based on genuine concern and their own experiences. They mention wanting to be gentle and not pushy. On the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially since the author isn't an expert. The line here is about respecting boundaries versus genuine concern.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often considered okay to express concern if done respectfully and with the intent to help. The author is not forcing anything, just offering an option. The friend's resistance could be due to personal reasons, but the author isn't being confrontational. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intentions are good and they're approaching the issue with care and without being overbearing.\n"
