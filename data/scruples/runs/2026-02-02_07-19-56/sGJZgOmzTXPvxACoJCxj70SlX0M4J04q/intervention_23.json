I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author is concerned because their friend's child isn't speaking and has other developmental delays. They mention their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic person, which led to difficulties. They want to encourage evaluation but are worried about coming off as pushy. The friend is defensive, possibly due to past trauma (losing a child) and pride.\n\nThe author wants to help but is being cautious. On one hand, they're not forcing the issue, just suggesting options. On the other, the friend might feel criticized. The question is whether the author is overstepping.\n\nI should consider the context: the author is a friend, not a parent. They're not a medical professional, so they can't diagnose, but they can share concerns. The key is the approach. The author says they're being gentle and not lecturing. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or denial. The author's intention is to help, based on their own experience, which is valid.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're not attacking or being cruel. They're sharing concerns in a respectful way. The friend's response is closed-minded, but that doesn't make the author the asshole. The author is trying to support, even if the friend isn't receptive. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's something I'm missing. Maybe the author is prying or overstepping parental authority? The original question says the author is trying not to be too forward. So, they're being careful. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
