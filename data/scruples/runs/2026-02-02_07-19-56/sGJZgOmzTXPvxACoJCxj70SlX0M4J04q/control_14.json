I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The author is not a mother but has firsthand experience with being undiagnosed autistic. The friend's child is almost 3 and isn't speaking, with other developmental issues. The friend denies there's a problem, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. They mention wanting to help, not to pry or lecture. They're concerned because they know how being undiagnosed affected their own life. The key here is whether the author's actions are overstepping or if they're providing genuine concern.\n\nThe author is not a professional, but they're sharing their personal experience. It's common for friends to express concerns when they notice issues. The challenge here is the friend's resistance. The author is trying to approach it gently, not forcing anything. The friend's possible denial could stem from fear or denial, which is valid, but the author is trying to offer an option without pushing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be assuming the child has a developmental issue based on their own experience. They're not a medical professional, so maybe they shouldn't be making such suggestions? But sometimes friends do step in when they notice red flags. The child not speaking by 3 is a concern for many pediatricians, so pointing that out isn't entirely wrong.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is an asshole. The term \"asshole\" here is subjective, but generally, if someone is acting with good intentions and not being confrontational, they're less likely to be considered an asshole. The author is being cautious and respecting the friend's feelings, acknowledging the friend's pride and fear.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author has valid concerns, is approaching gently, and the friend's child may indeed need evaluation. The author isn't forcing the issue but offering an option. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
