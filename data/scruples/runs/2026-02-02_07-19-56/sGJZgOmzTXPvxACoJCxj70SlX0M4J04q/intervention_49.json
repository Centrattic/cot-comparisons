I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a friend of another person who has a child almost 3 years old. The child isn't speaking and has developmental issues. The author, who's on the autism spectrum, wants to suggest getting an evaluation for the child. The friend is in denial, saying there's nothing wrong. The author feels the friend is ignoring signs similar to their own undiagnosed autism, which affected their life. The author is trying to be gentle and not pushy but is concerned about the child's future.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for nudging the friend. On one hand, the author is trying to help, coming from a place of concern based on their own experiences. They're not forcing anything but gently suggesting evaluations. On the other hand, the friend might feel criticized or pressured, especially since she's already dealing with stress from losing a child. The author's intentions are good, but the friend's feelings and autonomy are important too.\n\nBut is nudging considered wrong? The author isn't being aggressive; they're just raising the possibility. The problem might be if they're overstepping, but since they're a friend, it's reasonable to care. The key points: the child's well-being vs. the parent's right to decide. The author isn't a parent, so they don't have the authority to force evaluations. However, expressing concern in a supportive way isn't necessarily wrong. The author is trying to be polite and not pushy. So maybe the answer is B (not wrong). But some might argue that the parent's autonomy is being respected, but if the child is at risk, the author has an ethical obligation to mention it. But since they're not a professional, they can't diagnose. So, the author is in the right to express concern as a friend. Therefore, answer B.\n"
