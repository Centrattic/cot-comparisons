I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend whose child isn't speaking and shows developmental delays, and the writer is nudging the friend to get an evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the writer's intentions. They mention they're not a mother, so they might not have the same perspective, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and struggling. Their concern seems genuine\u2014they want the child to get help early, which could improve their life. The friend, on the other hand, seems resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child in a legal battle.\n\nIs the writer overstepping? They\u2019re trying to be gentle, not pushy. They\u2019re not lecturing but offering an option. The friend is the one with the child, so the parent has the final say. The writer isn't forcing anything; they're suggesting based on their own experience. But maybe they're imposing their own fears or experiences onto the friend's situation. However, the concern for the child's well-being is valid. Early intervention can make a big difference, so the writer's nudge is from a good place.\n\nBut there's a line between helping and overstepping. If the writer keeps nudging despite the friend's resistance, that could be problematic. The key here is that the writer is trying to be subtle and not pushy. The question is whether their concern is justified. Since the child's delays are significant and could indicate a need for evaluation, the writer is acting in the child's best interest. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re advocating for a child who might need help, and while it's sensitive, their intentions are good.\n"
