I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author is a non-mother who's not a parent but is concerned about their friend's child who shows developmental delays. The friend is resistant to getting an evaluation, and the author is considering nudging her towards that.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid concern based on their own experience being undiagnosed. They're not pushing for evaluation aggressively but want to gently suggest it. The friend is defensive and maybe proud, and there's a history of losing a child. The key here is intent versus action. The author isn't forcing anything, just offering support and information. They're trying to help, not criticize. The mother has the final say, but the author's approach seems well-meaning. So, the answer is B.\n"
