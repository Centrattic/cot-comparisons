I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for advising their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're not a parent and have no experience with children, but they have personal experience being undiagnosed autistic, which affected their life. Their friend's 3-year-old isn't speaking and shows other symptoms that concern the author. The friend has complained about these behaviors but refuses to consider evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nThe key points here are intent and approach. The author's intention is to help, not to pry or lecture. They want to share their perspective, hoping the friend considers evaluation as an option. However, the challenge is whether they're overstepping. The friend might not want unsolicited advice, especially from someone without expertise. But the author is careful to be gentle and not forward, which reduces the chances of being abrasive. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's refusal could stem from emotional reasons, like fear of past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle). The author is trying to be supportive, using their own experience as a basis, which might be relevant. But it's still a sensitive issue, and pushing even gently might not be appropriate if the friend isn't ready. \n\nIn terms of being \"the asshole,\" it's about whether they're being inconsiderate or causing harm. Since the author is trying to help and is respectful, they might not be in the wrong. But they could also be ignoring the friend's boundaries if the topic is off-limits. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the friend's reaction. If the author is being persistent and the friend has clearly indicated they don't want to discuss it, that could be a problem. But the post says the author is \"constantly\" nudging, which might be seen as too much. However, since they're doing it gently and with good intentions, maybe it's not the author's fault. But they might not be the right person to give this advice. So, considering all, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because their intent is positive and they're being careful, even though the situation is delicate.\n"
