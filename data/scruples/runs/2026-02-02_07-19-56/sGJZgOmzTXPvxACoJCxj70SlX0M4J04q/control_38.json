I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The author is not a parent but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend dismisses the idea of an evaluation.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is the asshole for gently suggesting evaluation. The author's main concern is that the child might have a developmental issue, based on their own experience. They want to help but don't want to be pushy. The friend might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's intention is to help, not to pry. They're using their own experience to highlight the benefits of early intervention. But the friend is defensive and maybe anxious. The author is trying to be gentle, not forceful. \n\nIs it wrong to express concern for someone else's child? In many cases, people are encouraged to speak up if they notice developmental issues. Early evaluation can be crucial. However, the parent's rights and feelings are also important. The author isn't overstepping by being confrontational; they're offering support. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreaching because they're not a professional. However, friends often give advice based on their experiences. The key is that the author is suggesting an evaluation as an option, not making accusations. The friend's reaction might be due to fear or past issues, not the author's approach. \n\nI think the author is in the right. They're showing care and concern, trying to help without being pushy. The friend's response is more about her own fears. So the answer would be B (No). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe if the author is too persistent, but the scenario says they're being gentle. So B seems correct.\n"
