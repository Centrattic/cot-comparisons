I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. \n\nFirst, the context: The author isn't a parent, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. Their friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, showing delayed social skills, and the mother denies any issues. The author is concerned because they know how their own undiagnosed condition affected them. They want to mention the benefits of evaluation but are careful not to be pushy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the friend is the parent, so ultimately she's the one making decisions about her child. But the author is coming from a place of concern, not malice. They're not forcing anything, just suggesting evaluation. The mother might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle), which complicates things. The author is trying to be gentle and not lecture her. \n\nPossible angles: On one hand, the author isn't the parent and might not have the right to push for evaluations. On the other hand, they're motivated by genuine concern and want to help prevent future issues. But where's the line between helpful and overstepping? The key factors here are the author's intention and approach. They mention being \"gently\" and not forward. The mother's pride and fear could be barriers. If the author keeps nudging without causing harm, maybe it's okay. But if they're crossing into judgmental or intrusive territory, maybe not. The author isn't making accusations, just offering information. So, perhaps they're in the right because they're acting in a caring way without being overbearing. The answer might be B.\n"
