I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Would I Be the Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is a friend whose child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but refuses to consider an evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child after a legal battle. The author, being on the spectrum themselves, wants to suggest evaluation and therapy but is hesitant to come off as pushy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to nudge their friend towards evaluation. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The friend's child might have a disability that could be addressed with early intervention. The author's concern is genuine, driven by their own experiences and wanting to help prevent similar struggles for the child. However, they are not a parent or professional, so they need to balance their input carefully.\n\nIn many cases, friends or family members can offer support and suggestions, especially if they notice a child isn't meeting developmental milestones. Delaying evaluation could hinder the child's access to necessary services. The key here is the tone and approach. The author mentions they want to be gentle and not forward, which is good. They're not forcing anything but suggesting it as an option. The friend's resistance might stem from emotional reasons, not just dismissiveness.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in the child's best interest with empathy and without being overbearing. The answer is B.\n"
