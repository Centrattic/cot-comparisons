I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of a \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental or mental issues.\n\nFirst, the author is not a parent or expert in child development but shares their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic person. They mention their friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and exhibiting behaviors below age-appropriate levels. The friend has complained about these symptoms but dismisses the idea of evaluation. The author feels concerned, wanting to help avoid the negative impact of being undiagnosed, and is considering gently suggesting evaluation without being pushy.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The key points are the child's age, delayed speech and developmental signs, and the friend's resistance. The author is motivated by concern, not malice. They're not forcing the issue but want to present evaluation as an option. The question is whether this is appropriate.\n\nIn such cases, friends can offer support without overstepping. The author is using their personal experience to highlight potential benefits, not diagnosing or criticizing. Since the friend is already expressing frustration with the child's behavior, the author's input could be helpful. However, there's a line between concern and overstepping. But given that the author is being gentle and respectful of the friend's pride and fears, it seems well-intentioned.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: They might be overstepping by assuming to know what's best, especially without professional knowledge. However, the author is not making demands but suggesting an option, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's well-being is a priority. Delayed development could benefit from early intervention, and the author's concern is valid. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or pride, but the author's intention is to help, not to judge.\n\nIn WIBTA communities, the focus is on social appropriateness and intentions. Here, the author is acting out of care and trying to be respectful. Therefore, they're likely not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
