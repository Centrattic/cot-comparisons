I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for nudging a friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues. The friend's child is almost three and not speaking, with symptoms that the author associates with being on the spectrum, based on their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic. The friend is resistant, saying there's nothing wrong, and the author is worried about the child's future and the friend's pride due to past losses.\n\nFirst, the author is not a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and the challenges that came with it. Their intention is to help, not to pry or lecture. The key here is the author's approach\u2014gentle and non-forceful. They mention not wanting to be forward and just offering the option.\n\nThe friend's resistance might come from fear of losing another child or pride, but the author isn't forcing the issue. They're trying to raise awareness without being confrontational. The child's well-being is a concern, and the author is acting out of care. However, there's a line between concern and overstepping. But given the information, the author is trying to be supportive and cautious in their approach. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
