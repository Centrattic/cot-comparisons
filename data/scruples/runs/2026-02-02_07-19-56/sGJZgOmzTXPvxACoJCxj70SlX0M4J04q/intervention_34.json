I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not a mother, is nudging her friend to get her almost 3-year-old child evaluated because the child isn't speaking and shows other developmental concerns. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing custody after a previous legal battle. The author wants to help but is worried about overstepping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned for the child's well-being based on her own experience with being undiagnosed and how it affected her. She's trying to help, but her friend is defensive. The question is whether she's the asshole by pushing for an evaluation.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let me break it down. On one hand, the author is motivated by care and wanting the child to get help early, which is crucial for developmental issues. On the other hand, the friend may not be ready to hear this, and the author isn't a medical professional. But the author is just suggesting an evaluation, not diagnosing anything. She's trying to be gentle and not pushy.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might feel attacked or criticized, especially with the history of losing a child. The author's friend might be defensive, so the author's approach needs to be very careful. However, if the child is in a situation where an evaluation could make a big difference, the author has a valid concern. Early intervention is important in developmental cases, so the author's intention is good.\n\nBut is it the author's place to keep nudging? The author isn't a parent, so maybe they overstep. However, if they have a close relationship where they feel comfortable giving advice, perhaps it's okay. The line between concern and overstepping can be blurry here. The author is trying to be gentle and not forward, which is good. Still, the friend's resistance might be due to personal issues, not just pride.\n\nIn the end, the author is acting out of concern for the child's best interest, even if the friend isn't receptive. The author isn't forcing anything, just presenting an option. So while the friend's feelings are important, the child's well-being is a higher priority. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing a concern she has, especially with her own experiences in mind. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
