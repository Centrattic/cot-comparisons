I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues. The friend is resistant, and the author is concerned about the child's future based on their own experience with an undiagnosed condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but their concern comes from personal experience. They've seen how not getting a diagnosis affected their life. The friend is already complaining about the child's behavior, which the author associates with potential developmental issues. The key here is the motivation: the author wants to help, not to pry or judge. They mention being gentle and not lecturing, which suggests they're trying to approach it sensitively.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is overstepping. Parental choices are personal, and even if the author has good intentions, repeatedly bringing up evaluations could be seen as intrusive. The friend's resistance might stem from fear or pride, as mentioned. The author is trying to balance concern with respect for the friend's autonomy.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If the child does have a developmental issue, early intervention is crucial. The author's nudging could lead to timely help. However, if the author is pushy, it might strain the friendship or cause the friend to shut down. The question is whether the author's actions cross a line into being overbearing.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to express concern for someone's child if you believe there's a genuine issue, especially if you have relevant experience. But it's important to approach it without being judgmental. The author says they're not being forward, which is a good sign. The line between helpful concern and overstepping can be thin, but since the author is trying to be gentle and the intent is to help, it's more on the side of not being wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their intentions are good, they're approaching it sensitively, and they're not forcing the issue. They're offering an option based on personal experience, which is a valid concern when it directly relates to the child's well-being.\n"
