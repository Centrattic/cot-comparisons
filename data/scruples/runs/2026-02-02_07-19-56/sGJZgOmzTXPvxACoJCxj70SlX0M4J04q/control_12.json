I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. Their friend's 3-year-old isn't speaking and is behind in development. The friend is complaining about symptoms but refuses to get an evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nThe author is trying to gently suggest evaluation, not pushy. They're concerned because they know the impact of undiagnosed autism. The key points here are: the author's concern is genuine, their approach is gentle, and they're not forcing anything. The friend isn't receptive because of personal fears.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle: is the author overstepping? Well, the friend is a parent, and parents have the right to make decisions for their children. However, the child's well-being is a societal concern. If the child is in danger or being harmed, others might have a duty to intervene. But in this case, it's about developmental delays, which might not be as urgent as abuse or neglect.\n\nThe author isn't a professional, so they can't diagnose, but they can express concern. The line is between concern and overstepping. Since the author is approaching it gently and not forcing, they're probably in the right. The friend's resistance is due to personal issues, not the author's approach being wrong. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
