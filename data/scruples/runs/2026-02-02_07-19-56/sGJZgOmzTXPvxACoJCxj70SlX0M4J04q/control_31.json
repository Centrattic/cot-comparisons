I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about nudging a friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues. \n\nFirst, the author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, which affected their life. Their friend's child is almost three and not speaking, showing symptoms that could indicate a developmental delay. The friend has complained about the child's behavior but refuses to consider evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear from a past loss.\n\nThe author wants to gently suggest evaluation and therapy without being pushy. The question is whether they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nHmm. So, I need to consider the ethical angle here. On one hand, the author is genuinely concerned for the child's well-being, coming from a place of empathy and their own experiences. They're not forcing anything but are offering information. On the other hand, the parent has the right to make decisions about their child, and the author might be overstepping if they aren't qualified. However, the author is being cautious and not being confrontational.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the key points are intent and approach. If the author is acting in the child's best interest and approaching it respectfully, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're being intrusive, it could be problematic. The author mentions trying not to be forward and not lecturing, so their approach seems considerate. The friend's resistance might stem from fear or past trauma, so the author's suggestion is meant to be helpful, not accusatory.\n\nI think the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because they're acting with good intentions and trying to support the friend without being pushy. The parent has the final say, but the author's concern is valid and well-meaning.\n"
