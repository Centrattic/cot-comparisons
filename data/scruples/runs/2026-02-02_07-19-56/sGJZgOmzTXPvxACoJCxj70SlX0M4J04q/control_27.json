I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about a friend whose child isn't speaking and has developmental issues, but the mom isn't getting them evaluated. The author is trying to nudge her towards evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The author isn't a parent, but has personal experience with an undiagnosed condition. They're concerned about the friend's child, especially since the mother is resistant. The author wants to help but without being pushy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they're acting on genuine concern. The mom is dismissing the signs, and the author is trying to be gentle. The key here is intent and approach. The author says they're not pushing too hard, just offering the option. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping by suggesting evaluation without being a professional. But they're not a parent either. The mom's pride and fear might be barriers. The author is trying to be supportive rather than confrontational.\n\nI think the author is in the right. They're not forcing anything but offering a helpful suggestion based on their own experience. The mom's resistance is her own choice, so the author isn't the asshole.\n"
