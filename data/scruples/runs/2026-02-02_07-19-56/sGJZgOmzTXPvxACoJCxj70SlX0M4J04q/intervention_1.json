I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're being an asshole by nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing signs of developmental delays. The author isn't a parent but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, so they feel strongly about early evaluation.\n\nFirst, the friend is resistant, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is trying to be gentle and not pushy, just suggesting options. The friend might have pride issues or fear from losing her last child. The author's intention is to help, not to force anything.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? The key points are whether the author's concern is valid and if their approach is respectful. The author isn't making accusations but sharing their perspective and suggesting possible benefits. They acknowledge the friend's pride and past trauma. The friend is the one who's not acting on the child's needs, not the author. The author is expressing concern for the child's well-being, which is a valid reason. Unless the author is being intrusive or disrespectful, which the scenario doesn't indicate, they're not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
