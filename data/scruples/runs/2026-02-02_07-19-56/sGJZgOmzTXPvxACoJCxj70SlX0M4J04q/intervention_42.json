I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The situation involves the author, who is not a mother, noticing that their friend's almost 3-year-old child isn't speaking and shows other developmental delays. The friend is in denial and doesn't think there's anything wrong. The author is concerned because they themselves were undiagnosed autistic and suffered, so they want to help but are worried about coming off as pushy or an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention is to help, right? They're not acting out of malice but genuine concern based on their own experiences. However, the question is whether their actions are appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to get their friend to seek professional help, which could be beneficial for the child. Early intervention is crucial in developmental issues, so the author's motivation is good. They mention being gentle and not wanting to lecture, which suggests they're trying to approach the situation carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is overstepping. Even with good intentions, someone else suggesting that there's a problem with a child can be sensitive. The friend might feel that her parenting is being criticized, especially since she's already dealing with personal issues like the loss of her other child. The author might be perceived as intrusive, especially since they aren't a parent themselves.\n\nAnother angle is the author's lack of expertise. They admit they know nothing about motherhood, which could mean they're not the best person to advise. However, they bring up their own experience with being undiagnosed, which adds credibility to their concern. But does that make it okay to intervene?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the friend's pride and fear mentioned. The author acknowledges that the friend might be in denial due to past trauma. If the author persists, it might cause tension or push the friend further into denial. However, if they say nothing, the child might miss out on crucial help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're not acting with malicious intent. They're trying to help. But the way they approach the friend could be problematic. The key is how they communicate their concerns. Since they say they want to be gentle and not forward, maybe their approach is appropriate. However, even with the best intentions, they might not fully understand the friend's situation. The line between helpful and overstepping can be thin here.\n\nIn many cases, people do have a right to voice concerns about a child's well-being, especially if it's in the child's best interest. But it's also possible to overstep if not careful. The author is trying to balance these factors. Given that they're approaching it gently and not forcing the issue, perhaps they're in the right. But if the friend feels pressured, the author might be crossing a line. However, without knowing the exact tone and context of their conversations, it's hard to say definitively. But based on the description, the author's intentions are good, and they're trying to be considerate. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A because they're not the parent and shouldn't be making such decisions. Hmm.\n"
