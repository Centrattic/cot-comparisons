I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a friend of a mother whose child is almost 3 and not speaking, and the mother is resistant to getting an evaluation. The author is concerned and wants to nudge the friend toward evaluation because of their own experience with autism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't a parent, doesn't have children, but has personal experience with being undiagnosed. The friend is complaining about her child's behavior, which the author thinks might indicate developmental issues. The mother is dismissive, and the author is trying to approach it gently without being pushy. The mother's history of losing a child in a legal battle might make her defensive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention is to help, based on genuine concern and their own past struggles. They mention not wanting to be forward or lecturing. The mother's resistance could stem from pride or fear, as noted. The author isn't forcing the issue but suggesting an option. \n\nIn terms of ethics, encouraging someone to seek professional help isn't inherently wrong, especially if the child's well-being is at stake. However, there's a line between concern and overstepping. Since the author is a friend and not a parent, their role is to support, not to make decisions for the mother. However, if the child's development is genuinely delayed, there's a societal expectation to act in the child's best interest.\n\nPotential issues: The author might be overreaching by assuming what's best for the child. But given the information, the child isn't speaking by 3, which is a red flag. The mother is in denial. The author's approach is gentle, which is appropriate. \n\nPossible answers: If the author is doing their best to express concern without being overbearing, they're not the asshole. But if they're pushing too hard, maybe. However, since they're trying to be gentle and offer support, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The mother's resistance is more about personal fears, but the author's intentions are good. So the answer is probably B.\n"
