I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend whose child is not speaking and shows developmental delays, and the author is nudging the friend to get the child evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and the impact it had. They're concerned for their friend's child's well-being and want to offer help without being pushy.\n\nThe friend is defensive, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child. The author is trying to approach this gently, not forcing the issue but mentioning the benefits. The key here is the balance between genuine concern and overstepping. \n\nIn similar situations, the community often values intentions versus actions. Since the author is not being confrontational or aggressive, and is instead offering support based on their own experiences, it's more about looking out for someone else's child's welfare. However, it's a delicate situation because parents can feel defensive when their parenting is questioned, even if the concern is about the child, not the parent's abilities.\n\nBut the author isn't diagnosing the child or criticizing the mother. They're just suggesting an evaluation, which is a normal step for developmental concerns. So, unless the author is being insistent or causing harm, their intentions are good. The challenge is the friend's reaction, but the question is about the author's actions. Since the author is being gentle and not overbearing, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is overstepping without professional knowledge. But given that they're not a medical professional but have a personal stake in early intervention, it's a gray area. The key is that the author isn't being pushy. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
