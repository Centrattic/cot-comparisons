I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost three and not speaking, showing developmental delays. The author is concerned because they themselves were undiagnosed autistic and suffered consequences from not being evaluated. The friend, however, is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child in a legal battle.\n\nFirst, the author has good intentions. They\u2019re motivated by their own experiences and want to prevent the child from going through similar struggles. They mention being gentle and not wanting to lecture, which shows they're trying to approach it sensitively. But is that enough?\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respecting the parent's decisions. The author isn't a parent or a professional, so they don't have the authority to push for evaluations. Even with good intentions, repeatedly nudging someone about their child can come off as intrusive or judgmental. The friend is already showing resistance, so the author needs to be careful not to override the parent's autonomy. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's possible emotional reasons\u2014like fear of losing the child due to past legal battles. The author should consider that the friend might be defensive or in denial because of these fears. Pushing too much could make the friend feel attacked, which might damage their relationship.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to be supportive and is offering a suggestion based on genuine concern. The question is whether concern outweighs the potential overstepping. The line between helpful advice and being overbearing is thin here. Since the author is not a medical professional and the parent is the one making the decisions, the author's role is more of a concerned friend rather than someone with authority. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to respect the parent's choice unless there's a legal or safety concern. The author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; they're just sharing their perspective. The issue is whether their nudging is appropriate. But since the author is being gentle and not forceful, they might not be the asshole. However, the line is very close. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intentions are good and they're approaching the situation with care, even if they're stepping into a sensitive area. But there's a valid argument that they're overstepping by persisting despite the friend's resistance. However, given the context and the author's approach, B seems more accurate.\n"
