I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this question is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author isn't a parent and isn't a mother, but they have experience with being undiagnosed autistic and know how it affected their life. Their friend's child is almost three and not speaking, showing symptoms that correlate with some mental impediment. When the author asks if she's had the child evaluated, the friend responds defensively, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is concerned because the friend is complaining about the child's behavior and thinks the child might benefit from evaluation and therapy. The author is trying to be gentle, not pushy, but the friend might have pride issues or fear from losing a previous child in a legal battle.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to keep nudging. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to help out of concern, having seen the negative effects of being undiagnosed. They're not forcing anything, just suggesting it as an option. On the other hand, the friend might feel criticized or pressured, especially if she's already defensive about her child's situation. The author isn't a medical professional, so maybe they're overstepping? But they're not a parent either, so perhaps their perspective is valid if they're acting in the child's best interest.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's intent (genuine concern), their approach (gentle, not lecturing), and the friend's possible defensiveness. The author might be right in thinking that early evaluation and therapy can help, but the friend's response suggests she might not be ready to accept that. The author is trying to encourage, not coerce. However, constantly bringing it up despite the friend's resistance could be seen as prying or not respecting boundaries. But the author mentions they're not trying to pry, just want the friend to consider it as an option. \n\nI should also consider the friend's history with a legal battle over her previous child. That could make her extremely sensitive about any suggestions related to her child's well-being. The author might not realize how triggering this could be for her. The author's intention is good, but the timing or frequency of the nudges might be problematic. \n\nIn the end, while the author has good intentions, repeatedly nudging someone who is resistant and has a history of trauma related to child custody might cross a line, even if done gently. It's possible that the friend's denial is a protective mechanism, and the author's persistence could be causing more harm than good. However, if the author is genuinely worried about the child's development and is acting in their best interest, they might not be in the wrong. But since the friend is not accepting the input, the author should be cautious about how often they bring it up. So, maybe the answer is B because the author is trying to help, not being malicious, but also A if they're not respecting the friend's wishes. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they are not a medical professional and their approach is gentle, it's more likely they are not in the wrong (B). But if the friend is clearly not wanting to hear it, maybe even then. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because they are acting from a place of care and trying to be supportive, even if the friend is resistant.\n"
