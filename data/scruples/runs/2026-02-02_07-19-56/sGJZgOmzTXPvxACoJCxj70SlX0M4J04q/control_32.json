I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing other signs that concern the author. The author isn't a parent but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned because they see their own struggles in the situation. They want their friend's child to get help, which is a good intention. But are they overstepping? The friend is resistant, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is gently suggesting evaluation and therapy, not pushing too hard.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the approach. The author isn't being confrontational and acknowledges they aren't an expert. They want to help without being pushy. The friend's possible reasons for not evaluating\u2014pride, fear of losing another child\u2014add context. The author is trying to offer support, not criticize.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their motivation is to help, they're being considerate, and they're respecting the friend's autonomy. Even if the friend isn't receptive, the author's concern is valid. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
