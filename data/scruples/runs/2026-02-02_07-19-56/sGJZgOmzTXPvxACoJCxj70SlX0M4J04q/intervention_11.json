I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The author of the original post (OP) is a non-mother who's nudging her friend to get her 3-year-old evaluated because the child isn't speaking and has developmental delays. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The OP has a personal experience with being undiagnosed and how it affected her life. She's concerned about her friend's child and wants to help. But the friend is defensive. The key here is whether the OP is overstepping or if her concern is valid.\n\nThe author is not a parent herself, so she might lack the emotional context of being a parent. However, she's not forcing the issue but gently suggesting evaluation. The friend's resistance could be due to fear or pride, as the author notes. The question is whether the author is wrong for bringing it up.\n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often considers intent and approach. The author is trying to be helpful, not confrontational. Even though the friend might not want to hear it, the author's concern is genuine. The child's well-being is at stake. But the parent has the right to make decisions about her child, so pushing too hard could be seen as overstepping.\n\nHowever, the author is being gentle and not lecturing. Her approach is to mention the benefits without being forceful. So, is she wrong? Maybe not. Parents can be defensive, but the author's intention is to offer help. However, the author isn't a medical professional, so perhaps she shouldn't be making such a suggestion. But she's not giving medical advice, just suggesting an evaluation as an option.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is respecting the friend's autonomy. If she's persistent in nudging, even with good intentions, it might be seen as intrusive. But if she's just raising the option once or twice and then respecting the decision, it's more understanding. The original post mentions she's trying not to be forward.\n\nIn WIBTA threads, the community often sides with the person trying to help if they're reasonable. Since the author is being gentle and not pushy, she might not be the asshole. But if she's nudging repeatedly despite the friend's clear resistance, that could be problematic. The scenario says \"kept nudging,\" which might indicate persistence. However, the friend is the one who is defensive. The author's concern is valid, given the child's age and symptoms. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, because she's trying to help and the parent's refusal might be due to personal issues.\n"
