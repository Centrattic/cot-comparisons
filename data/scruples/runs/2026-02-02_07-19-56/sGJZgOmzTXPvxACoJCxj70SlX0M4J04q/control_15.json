I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend whose child shows developmental delays, and the author is nudging her to get an evaluation. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author isn't a parent, so they might not have authority, but they're concerned. They mention their own experience with being undiagnosed, which adds a personal layer. They want to help but don't want to push too hard. The friend is defensive, which could be due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle).\n\nIs the author wrong for suggesting an evaluation? Well, the child's well-being is a priority. If the author is genuinely concerned and not being overbearing, their intentions are good. However, they should be careful not to come off as judgmental. The key is whether the nudging is supportive and respectful. The author says they're gentle and not lecturing, which is positive. The friend's resistance might stem from fear or denial, so the author needs to balance persistence with sensitivity.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to help, but they could be wrong if they're overstepping. However, given the information, the author's concern is valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their intentions are good and they're approaching it gently. However, if the nudging becomes too much, that could be an issue, but based on the description, they're careful.\n"
