I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is not a parent and not an expert in motherhood, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. They're concerned because their friend's 3-year-old isn't speaking and shows developmental delays. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but refuses to consider an evaluation, possibly due to fear of losing the child after a past legal battle. The author wants to gently suggest evaluation without being pushy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, their intention is to help, based on their own experience. The child's development is a red flag, and early intervention can be crucial. The author isn't forcing anything, just offering an option. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or pride. The key points are the concern for the child's well-being, the author's genuine motive, and the non-intrusive approach. It seems like the author is trying to do the right thing, even if the friend isn't receptive. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
