I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for a possible developmental issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, showing delays. The author has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and wants the friend to consider evaluation. The friend is resistant, maybe due to pride or fear from a past experience.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for advising this. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn WIBTA posts, the community usually considers intent and how the advice is given. The author is concerned, acting out of care, and not pushing too hard. They mention being gentle and not lecturing. The friend's child's well-being is the priority. The friend's resistance could be due to personal trauma, so the author is trying to offer support without being overbearing.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: They might be overstepping, assuming they know best, or causing the friend distress. However, the author is not forcing the issue, just suggesting an option. Their motivation is to help prevent future issues as they experienced.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend may need to make the decision herself, respecting her autonomy is important. But the child's health is a concern. The community often sides with people who are trying to help, especially when there's a genuine concern for a child's well-being.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions seem justified. They're not being confrontational, just offering support. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
