I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to think through this. So the question is asking whether the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The situation is that the author is not a parent but is concerned because their friend's 3-year-old isn't speaking and has developmental delays. The friend is in denial and the author feels driven by their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is not a medical professional but has personal experience with being undiagnosed, which caused them issues. They're trying to help their friend by suggesting an evaluation. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear from past experiences with losing a child in a legal battle. \n\nThe key points here are intent and approach. The author says they're trying to be gentle and not forward, not lecturing. They want the friend to consider it as an option, not forcing anything. So the concern is whether the author is overstepping, even with good intentions. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to do good, based on their own experience. They might believe that early intervention could help the child. On the other hand, the friend is the parent, and the author isn't a professional. There's a risk of causing offense or being perceived as judgmental, especially if the parent is already defensive. \n\nBut the author is not being confrontational. They're nudging gently and trying to avoid being pushy. The question is whether concern for a child's well-being justifies bringing up the issue, even if it makes the parent uncomfortable. \n\nIn some cases, friends might step in if they notice potential issues, especially if they have relevant experience. However, the parent's autonomy is important. The author isn't making a formal accusation but is offering support and information. \n\nI think the author's intentions are good, and they are being considerate in their approach. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or denial, which the author acknowledges. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to help without overstepping, so the answer would be B.\n"
