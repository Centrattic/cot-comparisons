I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is nudging their friend to get her 3-year-old child evaluated because the child isn't speaking and shows other developmental concerns. The friend is in denial and the author is worried about the child's future, drawing from their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author is not a parent or a medical professional, but they're based on their own experience with being autistic. The child isn't speaking at almost 3 years old, which is a significant red flag for language development. The friend is resistant and in denial, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nThe author is trying to be gentle and not pushy, but they keep bringing it up because they're worried. The question is whether this is the author's fault or not. \n\nOn one hand, the author has good intentions. They care about their friend and the child's well-being. They\u2019re sharing their own story to highlight the potential benefits of an evaluation. But on the other hand, the friend might feel pressured or judged. The author isn't a medical expert, so they don't have the authority to insist, but they\u2019re using their personal experience as a reason. \n\nI should consider if the author is overstepping. The friend is a parent, and while there are concerns, the author isn't in a position to force the issue. However, the child's welfare is a serious matter. In many places, if there's a real concern about a child's development, it might be a legal obligation to report it, but the author isn't doing that\u2014they're just trying to encourage the parent. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If they\u2019re being persistent but respectful and not being confrontational, maybe not. But if they\u2019re causing the friend to feel attacked, that's a problem. The author is trying to be helpful without being pushy. The friend's resistance is her own issue, possibly due to personal trauma. The author's actions seem motivated by genuine concern, not malice. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to help a child who might need it, even though they're not in a position of authority. However, there's a balance between helping and overstepping. Maybe it's a judgment call. But given the scenario, the author isn't being malicious, so the answer leans towards B.\n"
