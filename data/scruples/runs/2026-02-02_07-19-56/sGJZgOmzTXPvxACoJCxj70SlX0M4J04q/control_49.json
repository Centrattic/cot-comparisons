I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a friend who's nudging another friend to get her child evaluated because they suspect some developmental issues. The friend isn't getting the child evaluated despite the child being almost 3 and not speaking, and showing other symptoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or expert, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and how it affected their life. The friend is in denial, maybe due to pride or fear after losing a child in a legal battle. The author wants to gently suggest evaluation without being pushy.\n\nThe key points here are intention and approach. The author is concerned for the child's well-being, wants to help, and is not being forceful. They mention being gentle and not lecturing. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or past trauma, not necessarily the author's approach being wrong. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're bringing up a concern based on observed symptoms and their own experience. Since the child's development is a serious issue, the author's concern is valid. However, if they persist too much without respecting the friend's boundaries, that could be problematic. But the author says they're trying to be gentle and not forward.\n\nAlso, the friend's denial could lead to the child missing critical early intervention. The author's advice, if taken, could help the child. So, the author's intentions are good. The challenge is balancing concern with respecting the friend's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" unless the author is being invasive or accusatory, which they aren't, then they're not the asshole. The problem lies more with the friend's denial and fear, not the author's concern. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
