I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The situation involves the friend's child who is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author isn't a parent but is concerned based on their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intention here. The author is coming from a place of concern because they've seen the impact of undiagnosed autism themselves. They're not being confrontational, just gently suggesting evaluation. The mother, however, is resistant and in denial about any potential issues. \n\nThe key points here are the author's motive, the approach they're taking, and the mother's reaction. The author isn't pushing aggressively; they're trying to be gentle and not pushy. They're also aware of the mother's pride and fear of losing another child, which adds complexity. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it depends on whether the author has the right to intervene. Since the author isn't a parent or professional, their concern might be seen as overstepping. However, given that the friend is the one complaining about the child's behavior, the author is pointing out a possible solution she's ignoring. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting boundaries. The friend might not want that advice, even if it's well-meaning. The author is nudging, which is persistent but perhaps not in a disrespectful way. However, the mother might feel judged, especially if the advice is repeated despite her objections. \n\nI think the main factor is the author's approach. If they're doing it gently and not being pushy, they might not be the asshole. But if they're prying or making the mother feel bad, that could be a problem. The author mentions trying not to be forward, so maybe their approach is appropriate. The mother's resistance might be due to her own fears, not the author's intentions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is acting out of concern and not in a lecturing manner. They're trying to offer help based on their own experiences. Even though they're not a parent, their input could be valid. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
