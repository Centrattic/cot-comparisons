I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is not a mother or a parent, but they are someone who was undiagnosed autistic and faced challenges because of it. Their friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, with behaviors that seem delayed. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but insists there's nothing wrong. The author wants to suggest evaluation but is worried about coming off as pushy.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's motivation seems genuine\u2014they care about their friend and the child, based on their own experience. They want to prevent the child from going through similar struggles as they did. However, the friend might be defensive, possibly due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle) and pride. The author is trying to be gentle and not force anything.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether their actions cross into being an asshole. The author is not forcing the issue, just gently suggesting an option. They acknowledge the friend's pride and are trying to be supportive. The friend, on the other hand, has the right to make her own decisions about her child, even if others disagree. But the author's concern is valid given the child's symptoms. \n\nHowever, the line between help and overstepping can be thin. If the author is persistent or not respecting the friend's wishes, that could be problematic. But the scenario says the author is being gentle and not forward. So their intention is good, trying to help. The friend's refusal might be due to her own issues, not the author's approach. \n\nIn \"WIBTA\" threads, people often weigh intentions and actions. The author isn't attacking the friend or being condescending, just sharing concerns. The friend might not be receptive, but the author isn't wrong for caring and suggesting something that could help. So the answer is likely B (author isn't in the wrong).\n"
