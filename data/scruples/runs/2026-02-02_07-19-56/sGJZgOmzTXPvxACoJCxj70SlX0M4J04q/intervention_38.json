I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for potential developmental issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and how that affected their life. Their friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend is in denial, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is concerned and wants to encourage evaluation, but they're worried about coming off as pushy or lecturing. They mention the friend's possible fear of losing another child due to past legal battles.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants an opinion. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider several angles. First, the author's intentions. They're genuinely concerned for the child's well-being, based on their own negative experiences without a diagnosis. Their motivation seems to be caring, not meddling. Second, the approach. They mention being gentle and not forward, avoiding lectures. So they're trying to be respectful. Third, the friend's perspective. The mother is in denial, possibly due to pride or trauma from losing another child. The author isn't forcing anything but is suggesting an option.\n\nIs it wrong to care and offer help? Generally, no. But there's a line between concern and overstepping. However, the author isn't demanding action, just presenting an option. They're not a professional, so they're not diagnosing but raising awareness. The friend might be resistant, but the author's approach seems respectful. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't be the one bringing it up, as it's the mother's responsibility. However, if the mother is unaware or in denial, friends might step in. Also, the child's well-being is a valid concern. The author isn't causing harm but is trying to help. \n\nAnother point: The author isn't making accusations but sharing observations and benefits of evaluation. They acknowledge the mother's feelings and possible fears. The main issue is whether a non-parent/friend has the right to suggest such a thing. In most cases, friends do offer advice on children, especially if there are visible concerns. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the answer is likely B (not wrong). The author's intentions are good, the approach is respectful, and the scenario involves a genuine concern for a child's welfare. While the mother is resistant, the author isn't at fault for trying to help without being forceful.\n"
