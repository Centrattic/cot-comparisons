I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a non-parent who notices their friend's child isn't developing speech at age three and has other symptoms. The friend is dismissive, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is concerned because they were undiagnosed and it affected their life, so they want to suggest an evaluation gently without being pushy.\n\nFirst, the author isn't a parent or expert, but their concern is genuine. They mention the friend's child's specific issues, which are signs that might warrant an evaluation. The author is trying to help, not pry, and acknowledges the friend's possible pride or fear from a past loss. They want to present the idea as an option, not force it. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's response is defensive, and the author is being cautious not to lecture. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting out of genuine concern and is respectful, they're probably not the asshole. However, if the author is overstepping by pushing their own experience onto the friend, maybe. But given the details, the author is trying to be supportive without being intrusive. So likely the answer is B.\n"
