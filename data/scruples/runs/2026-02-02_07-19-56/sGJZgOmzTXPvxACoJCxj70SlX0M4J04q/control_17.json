I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person (the author of the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated.\n\nFirst, the author is not a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and how that affected their life. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend is aware of the symptoms but dismisses the idea of evaluation. The author is concerned because they remember their own struggles without a diagnosis and want the child to get help early.\n\nThe key points to consider: The author is trying to help, not being pushy. They mention not wanting to lecture or be forward. Their motivation is genuine, coming from a place of care and wanting the child to have better outcomes. The friend might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle), which could be why she resists the idea. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're not forcing the issue, just gently suggesting an option. They aren't making accusations or being confrontational. They're sharing their perspective from personal experience. Since the author is being respectful and considerate of the friend's feelings, their intentions are good. It's about encouraging an evaluation without overstepping. \n\nSo, unless the author is being persistent in a way that's harassing or disrespectful, which they aren't, they're probably not the asshole here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
