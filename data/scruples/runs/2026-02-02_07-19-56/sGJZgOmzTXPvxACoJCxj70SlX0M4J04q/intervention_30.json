I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, with other developmental issues. The author isn't a parent or expert but feels concerned because they were undiagnosed autistic. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're trying to help based on their own experiences. But on the other, they might be overstepping, especially since they're not a parent or professional. The friend is defensive, maybe due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nI think the author's intentions are good, but they need to approach it carefully. They're not a parent, so pushing too hard could come off as judgmental. However, gently suggesting evaluation without being pushy might be okay. The key is how they're communicating it. If they're doing it respectfully and not forcing the issue, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're being persistent without considering the friend's feelings, then maybe yes. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, as long as they're doing it gently and not prying. The author is trying to help, not being malicious. The friend's defensiveness is a factor too. It's a tricky situation, but the author's concern is valid, so maybe they're not the asshole.\n"
