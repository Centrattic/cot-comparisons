I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is wrong. The situation is that the author is nudging their friend to get her child evaluated because they notice the child isn't speaking and has other developmental issues. The author isn't a parent themselves but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. The friend is resistant, possibly due to fear of losing custody again after a previous legal battle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is well-intentioned, trying to help their friend's child. They mention their own experience with being undiagnosed, which adds credibility to their concern. The friend is in denial, maybe due to pride or fear. The author is being gentle and not pushy, just suggesting evaluation as an option.\n\nIs the author overstepping? They are friends, so the line between concern and intrusion can be blurry. The author is not a parent or expert, but their concern is based on observable signs. The friend is the parent, so the decision ultimately rests with her. However, the child's well-being is a public concern, but the author isn't a guardian. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the term usually refers to someone who is inconsiderate or intentionally causing harm. The author is trying to help, even if their approach is persistent. The key is whether they're respecting the friend's autonomy. The author says they're gently mentioning it and not forcing anything. The friend's resistance might be due to valid personal reasons, like fear of custody loss, which the author acknowledges.\n\nSo, the author is not wrong because their intentions are good, and they're trying to support their friend and the child. They're not being confrontational, just offering a suggestion. The friend's choice is her own, but the author isn't in the wrong for bringing up a potential solution to a problem she's already discussing.\n"
