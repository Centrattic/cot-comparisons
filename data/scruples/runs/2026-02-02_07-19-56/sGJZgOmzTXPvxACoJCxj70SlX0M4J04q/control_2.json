I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a friend of a mother whose child is almost 3 years old and doesn't speak, and has other developmental issues. The author has no experience with motherhood but has personal experience as an undiagnosed autistic adult, which affected their life. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior, and the author is concerned. When the author suggests getting an evaluation, the mother brushes it off, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child (since she lost one in a legal battle). The author is asking if they're an asshole for gently bringing up the idea of evaluation and therapy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's intentions. They are trying to help a friend's child, based on their own experience where an early diagnosis might have helped them. The author isn't forcing anything but is gently suggesting an option. The mother might be in denial or scared, which is common in situations like this. The author is not being confrontational or judgmental, just offering advice based on their own past.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not a parent or expert in child development. They might be overstepping if they're not careful. But they're approaching it gently, not lecturing, and respecting the mother's autonomy. The key here is the approach. If the author is being supportive and not pushy, then it's reasonable to express concern. The mother has the right to make her own decisions, and the author isn't forcing her to do anything. The author is also aware that the mother might have emotional barriers, like fear of losing another child, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of ethics, friends often give advice based on their own experiences. The author isn't doing harm by suggesting an evaluation. The mother can choose to ignore it, but the author isn't being malicious. So, the author is not in the wrong here. They're acting from a place of care and concern, even if their perspective is limited by their lack of expertise in this area.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to help without overstepping, and their approach is respectful and gentle.\n"
