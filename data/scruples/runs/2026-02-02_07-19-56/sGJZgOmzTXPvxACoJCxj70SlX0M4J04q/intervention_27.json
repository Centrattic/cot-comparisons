I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The OP isn't a parent, but they know about being undiagnosed autistic and want to help their friend's child, who seems to have developmental delays. The friend is resistant, maybe due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's child isn't speaking at almost 3 and has other developmental issues. The OP is trying to gently suggest an evaluation, not being pushy. They mention not wanting to lecture and understanding the friend's possible fears. The key here is that the OP's intentions are good\u2014they want the child to get help if needed. \n\nBut is pushing for an evaluation when the parent is in denial wrong? It depends on the approach. If the OP is being respectful and providing support without being forceful, then it's not their fault. They're trying to help without overstepping. However, if they're constantly bringing it up in a way that's annoying or intrusive, maybe that's crossing a line. \n\nThe OP says they're \"gently\" mentioning the benefits, not prying. They acknowledge the friend's pride and past trauma. So, their approach seems considerate. The friend is the one who might be in the wrong for dismissing concerns, but the question is about the OP. Since the OP is acting in good faith and with care, they might not be the asshole. \n\nBut some might argue that it's not their place to intervene. However, given the potential impact on the child's well-being, the OP's concern is valid. The answer hinges on whether the OP's actions are well-intentioned and respectful. Since they are, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
