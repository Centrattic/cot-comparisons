I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, showing developmental delays. The author isn't a parent but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, which caused them issues. They want to help their friend but are worried about being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's concern is valid because early intervention can be crucial for developmental issues. However, the friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear from a past legal battle. The author is trying to gently suggest evaluation without being pushy. \n\nOn one hand, the author is motivated by a desire to help, not to belittle the friend. They're using their own experience to highlight the importance of evaluations. That's caring. But on the other hand, the author isn't a parent or a professional, so maybe they're overstepping? However, the friend did mention the child's symptoms to them, which implies she might be seeking support or advice, even if she's not ready to act on it. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate. They mention trying not to be forward and not wanting to lecture. They acknowledge the friend's pride and fear. If the author continues to gently suggest options without forcing, that's reasonable. But if they become persistent or judgmental, that could be problematic. Since the author is asking if they're the asshole, they're aware of the potential for overstepping and are seeking balance.\n\nIn such cases, offering support and information without pressure is usually the right approach. The author's intentions seem good, so they're likely not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
