I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author is concerned because they have personal experience with undiagnosed autism and wants to prevent similar issues for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have their own experience with being undiagnosed. They mention that the friend is complaining about the child's behavior, which makes the author think of their own struggles. The key here is whether the author's concern is valid and if their approach is appropriate.\n\nThe author is trying to be gentle, not pushy. They acknowledge that the friend might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle). The question is if the author is overstepping by suggesting an evaluation. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions are to help. They aren't forcing anything, just offering information. On the other hand, the friend might feel that her parental decisions are being questioned. It's a sensitive issue because parenting choices are personal, and even well-meaning advice can be seen as intrusive. However, the child's well-being is a critical factor here. \n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If the child does have a developmental issue, early intervention is crucial. The author's concern might lead to beneficial outcomes if the friend takes the advice. But if the author is too forceful, it could damage their friendship. \n\nThe answer depends on the balance between the author's intention to help and respecting the friend's autonomy. Since the author is approaching it gently and isn't being aggressive, it's possible they're not in the wrong. However, there's a risk of overstepping if the friend feels judged. The key is whether the author is presenting the information as a suggestion rather than an accusation. \n\nGiven that the author is being cautious and respectful, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some people might argue that it's still meddling. However, considering the potential benefits of early evaluation, the author's concern is valid, and they're acting out of care. So probably B.\n"
