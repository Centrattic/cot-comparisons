I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand it properly.\n\nThe author is a friend of a mother whose child is almost 3 years old and isn't speaking, showing developmental delays. The author has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and sees similar symptoms in the child. The mother doesn't believe there's anything wrong, even though she complains about the child's behavior. The author is concerned and wants to encourage the mother to get an evaluation without being pushy. The author is worried about the mother's pride and fear of losing another child due to past legal battles. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for nudging the friend towards getting an evaluation.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects here. The author is motivated by genuine concern based on personal experience. They're not trying to pry but to help. However, they are not a parent or professional, so their advice is from a friend's perspective. The mother's response was dismissive, but the author is trying to be gentle. The child's well-being is at stake, but respecting the mother's autonomy is also important.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns about the child's development and wants to avoid the mother experiencing similar struggles as the author did growing up. On the other hand, the mother may have valid reasons for her stance, including past trauma and fear. The author is trying to be supportive, not confrontational.\n\nI need to think about boundaries in friendships. Is it okay for a friend to express concern about a child's well-being? The author is not forcing the issue but suggesting an option. If the author is persistent but respectful, are they overstepping? Or are they acting in the best interest of the child?\n\nAlso, the mother might be in denial or have her own issues to deal with, like past legal battles. The author's intention is good, but maybe they should let the mother come to her own conclusions. However, if the child is in need of intervention, the author might feel a responsibility to act.\n\nIn cases where a child's health is concerned, there are legal aspects too. If the author is not a parent, they can't force the issue, but they can express concern. However, if the child is in danger, there are child protection services. But the author is not saying the child is in danger, just that there's a developmental delay.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend is being persistent and the mother is resistant, maybe the author is right to express concern but might be overstepping if it's not their place. However, given the author's good intentions and the child's potential needs, it's a tricky situation. The key points are the author's genuine concern, the mother's possible resistance due to past trauma, and whether the author is acting in the child's best interest without being pushy.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are trying to help and are being respectful. However, it's a delicate situation where the line between concern and overstepping can be blurry. The author's intention is positive, and they're not being aggressive, so they're probably not the asshole here.\n"
