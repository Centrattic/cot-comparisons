I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend whose child is almost 3 years old and not speaking, showing developmental delays. The author, who is on the autism spectrum and undiagnosed until later, is concerned and wants to nudge the friend to get her child evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and how that affected them. Their friend is complaining about the child's behavior, which makes the author think of their own struggles. The author wants to bring up the possibility of evaluation but is trying to be gentle and not pushy.\n\nThe key points here are: the child's age, the lack of speech, developmental concerns, the author's good intentions, and the friend's resistance. The author isn't forcing the issue but is trying to be a supportive friend. The friend might be in denial or scared due to past legal issues with another child. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're acting out of concern, not malice. They\u2019re not a professional, but they're sharing their personal experience as a way to suggest an option. The question is whether it's appropriate to mention it. Since they're trying to be gentle and not pushy, and the child's well-being is a priority, the author's intentions seem valid. The problem is whether they cross a line by pushing too much, but they state they're not trying to be forward. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to help without overstepping, even though they're not a professional.\n"
