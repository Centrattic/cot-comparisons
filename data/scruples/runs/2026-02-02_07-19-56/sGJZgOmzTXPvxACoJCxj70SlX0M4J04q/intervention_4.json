I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this question is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a non-mother with no experience in motherhood but is on the autism spectrum. Their friend's three-year-old isn't speaking and shows signs of developmental issues. The friend is in denial, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is concerned because they know how being undiagnosed affected their life. They want to mention the benefits of evaluation but are trying not to be pushy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is trying to help based on their own experiences. They're not a professional, but they're expressing concern for the child's well-being. However, they might be overstepping by assuming they know what's best for another person's child, even if their intentions are good.\n\nOn one hand, the author's motives are genuine. They want the child to get support if needed, which is a compassionate stance. On the other hand, the mother has the right to make decisions about her child, even if they're not in line with others' opinions. The key here is whether the author is being respectful and not forcing their views.\n\nThe author mentions they're trying to be gentle and not lecturing. They acknowledge the mother's pride and past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle). This context suggests they're aware of the sensitivity. However, repeatedly nudging might be seen as intrusive, especially if the mother is in denial and the author isn't a professional. But the line between concern and overstepping can be thin.\n\nIn these situations, it's important to balance compassion with respect for others' autonomy. The author isn't forcing action but is offering a suggestion. If done respectfully, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if the nudging is persistent without considering the mother's feelings or boundaries, that could be problematic. The answer might hinge on how the author approaches the topic. Since they're trying to be gentle and not pushy, it's more about ensuring their concern is valid and not harmful.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because their intentions are good, they're not forcing action, and they're trying to be supportive. The mother's right to decide still stands, but the author's concern is reasonable given the child's possible needs. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
