I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author isn't a parent or a medical professional but is concerned about their friend's child who's almost 3, not speaking, and showing other developmental delays. The friend is in denial, and the author wants to suggest evaluation gently without being pushy. The author has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, which adds to their concern about early intervention.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author overstepping by suggesting an evaluation? They mention the friend is complaining about the child's behavior, so the author is trying to help. The friend's refusal might stem from pride or fear, perhaps due to past experiences with losing a child. The author is cautious not to lecture and wants to present it as an option.\n\nLegally, the author isn't a parent, so they don't have the authority to push for evaluations. Ethically, it's about the child's well-being. The author's intentions are good, but they might be imposing their own experiences without fully understanding the friend's situation. However, they aren't forcing actions, just suggesting an option. The line between helping and overstepping is thin here. Since the author isn't a medical professional, they might not have all the context, but their concern is valid given the symptoms described.\n\nIn \"WIBTA\" threads, the community often considers intent and approach. The author is trying to be gentle and not forceful, which is positive. However, they might be assuming the child has an issue, which could be incorrect. But given the symptoms mentioned, in many places, not getting a child evaluated when there are clear signs could be a red flag. The author is trying to encourage the parent to consider options that could help the child, which is a common concern in such situations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions are in the right place, and they're not being confrontational. They're trying to offer help based on their own experience with late diagnosis. Therefore, it's more likely they're not the asshole here.\n"
