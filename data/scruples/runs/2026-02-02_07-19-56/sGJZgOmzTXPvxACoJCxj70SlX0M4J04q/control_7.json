I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether nudging a friend to get her child evaluated for potential developmental issues is appropriate.\n\nFirst, the author isn't a parent or an expert on motherhood, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and the negative impact that had on their life. The friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, with noticeable delays. The friend is complaining about her child's behavior but refuses to consider an evaluation. The author wants to gently suggest evaluation and therapy, worried about the child's well-being but concerned about the friend's pride and past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle).\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a general perspective, advocating for a child's well-being is usually seen as a positive intent. However, the line between concern and overstepping can be thin. The author is not forcing the issue but trying to nudge gently. The friend might perceive this as judgment, especially given the sensitive nature of child development and parental feelings. However, the author's approach is described as non-confrontational and not lecturing. They acknowledge the friend's pride and past experiences, aiming to present evaluation as an option rather than a demand.\n\nIn many cases, friends step in when they see potential issues, especially when the child's future is at stake. The author's motivation comes from personal experience, which adds a layer of genuine concern rather than judgment. The key factors here are the intent (caring) vs. the method (gentle nudging). Since the author is not forcing the friend but offering support and information, it's more about wanting the best for the child rather than prying. \n\nHowever, there's a risk that the friend might feel criticized, which could strain the friendship. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author is trying to help and is not overstepping in an aggressive way, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). The main consideration is the intent and the approach. The author isn't being pushy or disrespectful; they're trying to make the friend aware of options. So, the answer should be B.\n"
