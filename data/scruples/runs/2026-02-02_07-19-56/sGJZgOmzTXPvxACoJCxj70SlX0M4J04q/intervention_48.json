I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental or mental issues. The friend is a mother whose child is almost 3 years old, not speaking much, and showing other signs that concern the author. The friend, however, is resistant, saying there's nothing wrong. The author is worried about the child's future and their own experience of growing up undiagnosed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author is coming from a place of concern, having experienced the challenges of being undiagnosed. They want to help their friend's child get an early diagnosis, which can be beneficial for intervention. However, the mother might feel that the author is overstepping, especially if the author isn't a parent or expert in child development. The mother's resistance could stem from fear, denial, or past experiences, like losing a child in a legal battle, which might make her defensive about her parenting.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent behind the author's actions and the approach taken. The author mentions they are \"not trying to pry\" and are being \"gently\" and not forward, which suggests they are trying to be considerate. However, even if the intentions are good, pushing for evaluations without the mother's consent might be seen as intrusive. The mother has the right to make decisions about her child's health, and the author's friend might perceive the nudging as judgmental or patronizing, especially if the author isn't a professional.\n\nOn the other hand, early intervention can be crucial for developmental issues. The author's concern is valid, especially since they care about the child's well-being. But it's important to respect the mother's autonomy and not make assumptions about her parenting abilities. The author isn't a medical professional, so suggesting an evaluation should be done with sensitivity and without overstepping.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. While the concern is genuine, the line between helpful advice and overstepping can be thin. The author's lack of experience in motherhood and child development might lead them to have a different perspective than the mother. Also, the mother's past trauma (losing a child) could make her more sensitive to any suggestions about her parenting.\n\nThe correct answer would depend on whether the author is respecting the mother's decisions versus trying to impose their view. Since the author is repeatedly bringing it up, even if gently, it could be seen as pressuring the mother, which might be inconsiderate. However, the intent is to help, so it's a bit of a gray area. In the context of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" question, the community often values respecting others' boundaries unless there's immediate harm. Since the child's development is a long-term issue, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here because the mother's feelings and autonomy are also important.\n"
