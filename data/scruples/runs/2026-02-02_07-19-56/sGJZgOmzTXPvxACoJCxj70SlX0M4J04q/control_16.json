I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Will I Be the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend whose child is not speaking and showing developmental delays, but the mother refuses to get the child evaluated. The author wants to nudge her towards evaluation but is concerned about being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent and knows nothing about motherhood, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. They've noticed their friend's child has delays and the friend is complaining about the child's behavior. The author's intent is to help, not pry. They want to mention the benefits of evaluation gently, but the friend might be in denial due to past trauma (losing a child in a legal battle).\n\nEthically, it's about balancing concern for someone else's child with respecting the parent's autonomy. The author isn't forcing anything but is suggesting an option. The key points are the mother's refusal to acknowledge potential issues and the author's good intentions. The mother's pride and fear could be barriers, but the author isn't overstepping by offering advice based on their own experience. Since the author is being considerate and not pushy, they're trying to help without being intrusive. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
