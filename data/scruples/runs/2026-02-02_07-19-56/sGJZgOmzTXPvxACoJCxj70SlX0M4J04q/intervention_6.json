I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author has a friend whose child is almost 3 and not speaking, showing developmental delays. The friend complains about the child's behavior but refuses to consider an evaluation. The author is nudging the friend to get the child evaluated, based on their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic person. They want to help but are worried about coming off as pushy or lecturing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess this. The key points here are the author's intentions and the context. The author is motivated by concern, not malice. They mention that the friend is constantly complaining about the child's behavior, which might indicate she's already aware of issues. The author wants to offer support and options, not force anything. They acknowledge that the friend might be in denial or scared, given the past legal battle. \n\nHowever, the main issue is whether the author is overstepping. The author is not a parent or expert, but they're trying to share their perspective. Since the friend is the child's parent, she has the final say in decisions. The author is gently suggesting an evaluation, not being aggressive. They also mention they're not trying to lecture. \n\nPossible counterpoints: The author's advice is based on their own experience, but maybe they don't have the expertise. However, expressing concern for a child's well-being is generally seen as caring. The line between helping and being overbearing is thin here. If the author is persistent but respectful and provides support, it's less likely they're in the wrong. If they're pushy and not respecting the parent's decisions, that's different. The scenario says they're \"gently\" nudging, not pressuring. \n\nConsidering the friend's possible pride and trauma from losing a child, the author is being sensitive. They're not forcing the issue. So, the author's intentions are good, and they're approaching it carefully. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
