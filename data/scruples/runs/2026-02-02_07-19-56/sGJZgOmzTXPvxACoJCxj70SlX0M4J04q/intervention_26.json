I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a friend of a mother whose child isn't speaking and shows developmental delays. The author is nudging the mother to get her child evaluated, but the mother is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent and has no expertise in motherhood, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and how it affected their life. They're trying to help, not prying. The mother is complaining about the child's behavior, so the author is concerned.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're not a medical professional, but they're pointing out possible issues. The mother's refusal might be due to valid reasons like fear or past trauma. The author is being gentle and not forceful, which is good. But does that make them the asshole?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions are positive\u2014they want the child to get help. On the other, the mother might feel criticized. However, the author is approaching it as a suggestion, not an accusation. The key here is whether the concern is genuine and the approach is respectful. Since the author is being gentle and not pushy, they're probably not the asshole. The mother's resistance has her own reasons, but that doesn't make the author wrong for caring. So the answer is B.\n"
