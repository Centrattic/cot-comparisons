I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to evaluate her three-year-old child's development, given that the child isn't speaking and exhibits other concerning behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't a parent or a medical professional but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. Their concern is based on the friend's complaints about the child's behavior and the fact that the friend might be in denial due to past experiences (losing a child in a legal battle). The author wants to recommend evaluation without being pushy, just suggesting it as an option.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The main factors here are intent and approach. The author's motivation is to help a friend who might be struggling, possibly out of pride or fear. The author is trying to be gentle and not lecture, which is commendable. However, the line between concern and overstepping can be thin. The friend might feel that the author is overstepping by offering unsolicited advice, especially regarding their child. But since the author is approaching it gently and the child's well-being is at stake, the concern is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend has the right to make decisions about her child's healthcare. The author isn't forcing anything but is suggesting an option. There's no indication of harassment or aggressive behavior. The author's own experience with being undiagnosed adds a personal stake, which might make their concern more genuine rather than intrusive. \n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often considers intentions. If the author is acting in good faith and with care, they're less likely to be the asshole. However, if the nudging becomes persistent or disrespectful, that could change things. The author mentions they're trying to be gentle and not forward, so the approach seems appropriate. The key is that the author is not forcing the issue but is expressing concern as a friend. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting from a place of genuine concern, not malice or control. They respect the friend's autonomy while still offering a suggestion based on observed behaviors. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
