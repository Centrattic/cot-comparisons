I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about nudging a friend to evaluate her child for possible developmental issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author isn't a parent or an expert but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. They notice their friend's child isn't speaking at almost 3 and shows other delayed behaviors. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but refuses to consider an evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and methods. They mention wanting to help their friend think about evaluation as an option, not to force anything. They're trying to be gentle and not forward, which suggests they're being considerate. The friend's resistance is based on her own fears and pride, which the author acknowledges.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If they're genuinely concerned and are approaching the topic with care, not in a confrontational way, it's reasonable to support their actions. The author isn't making accusations but is sharing their perspective based on personal experience. The main issue is whether it's appropriate to bring up the subject when the friend is already showing signs that might need attention.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for overstepping if the author isn't qualified. But since they're coming from a place of concern and not with a medical diagnosis, just suggesting evaluation as an option isn't necessarily wrong. The line between helping and being overbearing depends on how it's done. The author says they're not trying to lecture, so if they approach it tactfully, it's more about support than being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the friend's history with losing a child adds context. The author recognizes her fears, which shows empathy. So, the author is trying to be supportive while acknowledging the friend's situation. In that case, nudging gently for her to consider evaluation isn't wrong. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
