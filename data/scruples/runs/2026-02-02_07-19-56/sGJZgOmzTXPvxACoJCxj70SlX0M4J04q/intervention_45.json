I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend whose child isn't speaking and shows developmental delays, and the author is nudging the friend to get an evaluation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional but has personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. They're concerned because they see their friend's child struggling and don't want the kid to go through similar issues. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear from a past legal battle involving another child.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting an evaluation. The key points here are intent and approach. The author claims they're not being forward, just gently mentioning the benefits. Their motivation is to help, not to pry or lecture. The friend's resistance might be due to personal reasons, but the author is trying to offer support based on their own experiences.\n\nI should consider if the author overstepped. Since they're a friend, it's part of their role to care and offer advice when they see a problem. However, the line can be blurry. The author isn't a professional, so they shouldn't diagnose, but suggesting an evaluation is reasonable if they notice concerns. The fact that the friend is complaining about the child's behavior adds to the concern, making the author's intervention more about helping the child than being intrusive.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel their parenting is being questioned. The author needs to be careful not to come across as judgmental. However, the author says they're trying to be gentle and not forward, which is a good approach. The underlying fear of the friend losing another child is a valid concern, but the author's intention is to help, not to force anything.\n\nIn similar situations, friends often give advice based on their knowledge and experiences. Since the author has a personal stake in early intervention, their concern is valid. The key here is that the author isn't insisting but is suggesting an option. So, unless the author is being pushy or disrespectful, they're not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
