I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, with other developmental issues. The author, who isn't a mother but is on the autism spectrum themselves, feels concerned because they went undiagnosed and it affected their life. They mention the friend lost her last child in a legal battle and might be in denial due to pride or fear of losing the other child.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions seem genuine\u2014they want the child to get help if needed. They're not forcing anything but gently suggesting evaluation. The friend is in denial, which is a common issue when parents might be scared or in denial about a child's development. The author is trying to be careful not to be forward, which is good because no one wants to feel lectured.\n\nBut the author isn't a professional. They're relying on their own experiences as an undiagnosed autistic person. While their perspective is valid, they might not have the expertise to diagnose or push for evaluations. However, they're not making a diagnosis themselves; they're just pointing out the possibility and the benefits of evaluation. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by repeatedly nudging, even if gently.\n\nThe friend is the legal guardian and has the final say in her child's care. The author isn't pressuring or coercing, just offering an opinion based on observations. The line between concern and overstepping can be thin. But since the author is not forcing the issue and is being respectful, it's hard to see them as the asshole. The friend's resistance might be due to personal issues, not the author's rightness or wrongness.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're acting out of concern, not malice, and are being considerate in their approach.\n"
