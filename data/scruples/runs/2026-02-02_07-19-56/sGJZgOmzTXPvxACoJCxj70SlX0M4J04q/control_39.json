I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is encouraging a friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues, but the friend is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and the impact it had on their life. The child in question is almost 3 and not speaking, with other developmental concerns. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear related to a past legal battle involving her children.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong to nudge their friend towards evaluation. Let's break down the possible angles. \n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about the child's well-being and wants to help. They're sharing their own experience to highlight the potential benefits of early intervention. They're being gentle and not pushy, just suggesting evaluation as an option. That seems altruistic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't a professional, so they might be overstepping by diagnosing or suggesting evaluations. The friend might feel criticized or pressured, especially if she's already aware of the issues but is choosing not to act for her own reasons. There's also the aspect of respecting boundaries\u2014maybe the friend doesn't want unsolicited advice, even if it's well-meaning.\n\nBut the author mentions they're not trying to lecture and are being gentle. They acknowledge the friend's possible fears and try to approach it with empathy. Early intervention is crucial for developmental issues, so the author's concern is valid. However, the line between helping and overstepping can be thin. \n\nIn similar situations, it's often considered appropriate to express concern in a non-judgmental way. Since the author is doing that, maybe they're not in the wrong. The key is whether they're respecting the friend's autonomy while still voicing their concern. \n\nThe friend's resistance could be due to personal reasons, like fear of losing the child again. The author is trying to present evaluation as a positive option, not a criticism. So, unless the author is being aggressive or dismissive, they're probably not the asshole here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
