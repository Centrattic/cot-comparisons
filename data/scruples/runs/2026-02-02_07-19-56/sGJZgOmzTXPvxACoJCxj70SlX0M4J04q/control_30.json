I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is about nudging a friend to get her child evaluated when the child shows possible developmental delays. The author isn't a parent or an expert but is concerned based on their own experience as an undiagnosed autistic person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior, which includes not speaking at almost 3 and other signs. The author is trying to gently suggest evaluation without being pushy. The friend seems defensive, possibly due to pride or fear from past experiences. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions. They mention they don't want to lecture or pry, just want the friend to consider it as an option. They're coming from a place of concern, not judgment. The author is sharing their own story to highlight potential long-term impacts if issues aren't addressed early. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're not a parent or professional, but they're not making accusations either. They\u2019re providing information based on observed symptoms and their own experience. The mother's response suggests she's in denial or has emotional barriers. \n\nIn terms of being an 'asshole,' it's about intent and approach. The author is trying to be gentle and supportive, not confrontational. They acknowledge their lack of expertise and are offering help, not criticism. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). They're acting out of care and trying to help without forcing their views, which is reasonable.\n"
