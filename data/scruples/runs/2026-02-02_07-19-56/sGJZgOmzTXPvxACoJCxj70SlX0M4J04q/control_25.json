I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for nudging a friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3 and has developmental delays, and the friend is resistant.\n\nThe author has personal experience with being undiagnosed, so they're coming from a place of concern. They mention trying to be gentle and not pushy. The key points here are intent and approach. The author isn't being aggressive; they're trying to offer help based on their own struggles. The friend's resistance might be due to pride or fear from past experiences.\n\nI need to consider if the author is overstepping. Since they're not a parent or expert, but are genuinely concerned, it's a gray area. However, the author is advocating for the child's well-being, which is a valid concern. The method is gentle, so it's not lecturing. The friend's reluctance is her own issue, not the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer is B.\n"
