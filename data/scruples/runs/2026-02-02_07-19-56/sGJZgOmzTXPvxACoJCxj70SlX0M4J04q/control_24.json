I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a friend of someone whose child is almost 3 and not speaking. The friend (the mother) has mentioned symptoms that might indicate a developmental issue, but she's resistant to the idea of getting her child evaluated. The author, who is on the autism spectrum and was undiagnosed for a long time, is concerned because they know how that affected their own life. They want to nudge the friend gently to consider evaluation and therapy but are worried about overstepping. The author is trying to be respectful and not pushy, but they're still concerned.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole (WIBTA) if they continue to mention this. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The author is concerned about their friend's child's well-being. They have a personal stake because of their own experience with being undiagnosed. The friend is not getting help for her child despite noticing issues. The author is trying to be gentle and not pushy, but still wants to bring up the possibility of evaluation. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a good intention\u2014wanting to help the child get the support they might need. On the other hand, the mother might feel that her parenting is being questioned, which can be a sensitive topic. The author is not a parent or an expert, so there's a line between concern and overstepping. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is not forcing anything. They're trying to present it as an option, gently. The mother's resistance could be due to fear of losing the child in a legal battle (since she lost another child) or pride. The author is trying not to lecture, just to mention the benefits. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to express concern for someone's child if you genuinely believe there's a problem. However, it's important to be respectful and not pushy. The author seems to be doing that. They're not badgering but nudging gently. The mother is the one who's dismissive, so the author's actions are motivated by care and their own experience. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is overstepping by assuming what's best for the child. But given the symptoms described, not acting could be harmful. Also, the author is not a professional, but they're sharing their personal experience, which is valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help in a respectful way. The mother's resistance might be due to her own fears, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to express concern. So the answer is B.\n"
