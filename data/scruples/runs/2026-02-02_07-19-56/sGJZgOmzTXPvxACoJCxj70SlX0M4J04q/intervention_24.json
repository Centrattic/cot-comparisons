I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and has some developmental issues. The friend is in denial and the author is concerned because they were undiagnosed autistic and suffered because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The author is trying to help, right? They're not forcing anything, just gently suggesting evaluation. The friend might be defensive because of past experiences, like losing a child in a legal battle. So maybe the author is trying to be supportive, not pushy. But is it their place to do so?\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the parent, so maybe they overstep by bringing up such a sensitive issue. Even if their intentions are good, could they be causing stress or harm? The friend might feel judged or accused, which could strain their friendship. However, the child's well-being is important. If the child really does need help, not acting could be harmful.\n\nThe key points are the author's intentions and the method. They're being gentle and not forcing the issue, which is good. But they might not be qualified to assess the child's needs. The line between concern and overstepping can be thin. Also, the friend's pride and fears play a role here. The author might not realize how their suggestions are perceived.\n\nConsidering the potential consequences: if the child does have issues, not getting help is bad. If the author is wrong, the friend might be upset. But acting on good intentions with care could be justified. However, the author isn't the parent, so they don't have the authority to push for evaluations. It's a tough balance between wanting to help and respecting boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're approaching it sensitively and with the child's best interest in mind, maybe not. But if they're persistently pushing despite the friend's resistance, that could be an issue. The question is whether their actions are reasonable given the situation. Since they're not being aggressive and are just suggesting an option, perhaps they're not the asshole. But maybe they are overstepping by making such personal suggestions based on their own experiences without the parent's consent. Hmm.\n"
