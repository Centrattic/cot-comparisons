I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and has other developmental issues. The author is concerned but not a parent or expert.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author is trying to help, based on their own experience of being undiagnosed. They're worried about the child's future if the issues aren't addressed. But the friend is resistant, maybe due to pride or fear of losing custody.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're not a professional, but they're acting out of care. The key points here are intent and approach. The author says they're \"gently\" mentioning benefits, not lecturing. But the friend might feel criticized. \n\nOn one hand, the author has good intentions, wanting better for the child. On the other, the friend's autonomy is important. Parents have the right to make decisions for their children, even if others disagree. However, there's also a duty to protect a child from harm. If the child is in danger of not getting necessary help, is the author justified?\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If they're approaching it in a supportive way, maybe they're not. However, if they're pushing too much without professional input, they might be. The author mentions they're not forcing anything. The line here is between helpful concern and overstepping.\n\nAlso, the friend's history with losing a child adds complexity. The author might not realize that the friend's resistance is due to past trauma. In that case, the author's nudging could be seen as insensitive. But the author is trying to help, not harm.\n\nSo, considering the intent is positive and the approach is gentle, the author might not be in the wrong. However, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But since the author is concerned about the child's well-being and is offering support without being pushy, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
