I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be A Dick?) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated because the child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or expert but has personal experience as an undiagnosed autistic adult. They're concerned because they know how impactful an early diagnosis can be. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but isn't seeking help. The author wants to suggest evaluation but is worried about coming off as pushy.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's intentions and the method of their approach. The author is trying to help, not to pry or force. They mention they're not forward and want to present it as an option. The question is whether this is crossing a line.\n\nOn one hand, the friend is the parent, so she has the right to make decisions about her child. The author isn't a medical professional, so they can't diagnose, but they can express concern. The author isn't being aggressive; they're being gentle. However, the parent's resistance might be due to fear or past experiences (losing a child in a legal battle), which is valid. \n\nIs the author overstepping? If they're doing it in a kind, non-judgmental way, maybe not. But it's a sensitive issue. The line between concern and intrusion can be thin. The parent might feel pressured, especially if the author keeps bringing it up. But if the author is careful and respectful, maybe they're in the right.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because the friend is a parent, and the author is not in a position to dictate what's best for her child. Even with good intentions, suggesting evaluations could be seen as interfering. But the author isn't forcing, just offering information. \n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often considers the balance between concern and overstepping. If the author is doing it gently and not being pushy, they might not be the asshole. But if they persist despite the parent's clear stance, that's where they might cross the line. The situation here is that the author is \"nudging,\" which is a bit of a nudge but not aggressive. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is genuinely concerned, coming from a good place, and is trying to help without being forceful. The parent has the right to decide, but the author isn't wrong for expressing concern in a respectful way."
