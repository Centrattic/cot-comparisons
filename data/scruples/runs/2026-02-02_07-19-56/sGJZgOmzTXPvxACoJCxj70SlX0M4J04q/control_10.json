I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is wrong for nudging their friend about getting her child evaluated. \n\nFirst, the author is not a parent and has no expertise in motherhood, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. They're concerned because their friend's 3-year-old isn't speaking and shows developmental delays. The friend is in denial and doesn't want to consider an evaluation.\n\nThe author wants to gently suggest getting an evaluation but is worried about coming off as pushy. They mention the friend might be in denial due to past experiences (losing a child in a legal battle), which adds emotional complexity. The key points here are the author's intent to help, their approach being gentle, and the potential consequences of not acting.\n\nIn these situations, intentions matter. The author isn't trying to lecture but wants to offer support based on their own experience. However, the line between helping and overstepping can be thin. Since the friend is resistant and there's a history that makes her defensive, the author needs to tread carefully. But the friend's child's well-being is at stake. If the author is persistent but respectful, maybe they're justified. However, if they cross into being pushy or judgmental, that's where they'd be in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on how they approach it. The scenario says the author is trying to be gentle, not forceful. They acknowledge the friend's pride and past trauma. So, they're not in the wrong for expressing concern. The real issue is whether the friend's inaction is harmful, but the author's role is to raise awareness without being overbearing. Since they're not being aggressive and are motivated by concern for the child, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
