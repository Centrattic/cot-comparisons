I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend whose child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author, who is on the autism spectrum and was undiagnosed, is nudging the friend to get her child evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't a parent or a professional, but they're concerned based on their own experiences. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing her child again. The author is trying to be gentle, not pushy. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions are good\u2014they want the child to get help early. Early intervention can be crucial for developmental issues. The author is sharing their own story, which might resonate with the friend. But on the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is overstepping. The author isn't a professional, so maybe they shouldn't be the one to suggest evaluations. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing concern in a respectful way.\n\nI should also consider the dynamics. The author is being \"gently\" and not pushy. They acknowledge they're not an expert. The friend's resistance might be due to personal trauma (losing a child). The author isn't forcing anything but offering an option. It's possible that the author is right to be concerned, but maybe they need to back off if the friend isn't ready. However, the author's approach seems to be more about sharing information rather than lecturing.\n\nIn terms of whether it's the author's fault, if they're expressing concern without being aggressive, it's probably not their fault. They're trying to help, even if the friend isn't receptive. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure that the author isn't crossing a boundary. Since they're not a professional and the friend is resistant, maybe the author is overstepping. But again, they're doing it with good intentions and being careful not to be forceful. The line between helpful and intrusive can be thin here. But given the author's approach, they might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
