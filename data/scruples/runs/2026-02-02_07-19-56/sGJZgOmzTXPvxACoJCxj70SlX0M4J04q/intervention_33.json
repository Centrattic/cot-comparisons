I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental issues. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author isn't a parent and has no expertise in motherhood, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic. Their friend's child is almost three, not speaking, and showing signs that concern the author. The friend dismisses the idea of evaluation, maybe due to pride or fear from past experiences. The author wants to mention the benefits of evaluation without being pushy.\n\nThe key points here are intent and approach. The author is concerned for the child's well-being, coming from a place of having gone through similar struggles. They want to help without being overbearing. The question is if their nudging is considered wrong.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). If the author is genuinely concerned and is trying to support their friend gently, maybe they're not in the wrong. On the other hand, if they're overstepping or not respecting the friend's decisions, maybe they are. \n\nBut the author is trying to be subtle, not lecturing. They acknowledge the friend's pride and past trauma. They want to present the idea as an option. It seems like they're acting in good faith. The mother's responsibility is to her child, but the author isn't forcing anything. So maybe the answer is B. However, there's a line between concern and overstepping. If the author isn't qualified and the friend isn't receptive, maybe they are wrong. But the author's lack of expertise doesn't negate their genuine concern. The answer might depend on cultural norms around parenting and personal boundaries. In many cases, friends offering support in such situations aren't considered wrong, even if others disagree with their methods. So leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
