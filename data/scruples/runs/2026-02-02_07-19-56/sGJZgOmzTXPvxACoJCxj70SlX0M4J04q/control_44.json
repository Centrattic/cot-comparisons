I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author nudging their friend to get her child evaluated for possible developmental or mental issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is not a mother and has no experience with motherhood, but they are on the autism spectrum. Their friend's child is almost three years old, not speaking, and showing signs of developmental delays. The friend is complaining about these symptoms but resists getting an evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear of losing her child after a previous legal loss.\n\nThe author is considering gently suggesting evaluation and therapy. They acknowledge the friend's pride and the emotional sensitivity involved. The core question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing this up.\n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. The author is concerned about the child's well-being, which is a valid reason. However, the friend is the parent and has the right to make decisions about her child's care. The author is not a medical professional, so they might be overstepping by offering their opinion based on personal experience with autism.\n\nBut the author is approaching this gently and with good intentions, not forcing the issue. They are also aware of the friend's potential emotional barriers. The line between helpful concern and overstepping might be thin here. However, since the author is being respectful and not pushy, their intentions are genuinely to help. The friend's well-being and the child's potential needs are important factors.\n\nIn terms of \"Am I the Asshole,\" the community often considers intent and approach. The author is trying to be supportive without being intrusive. Even though they might not have all the expertise, their concern is valid. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is acting with good intentions and is being considerate of the friend's feelings.\n"
