I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a friend who's concerned about another friend's child. The child is almost three and not speaking, with other developmental concerns. The author, who's autistic themselves, thinks there might be an issue and wants the friend to get the kid evaluated. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for gently nudging their friend towards evaluation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's intent is good\u2014they care about the child's well-being and want to prevent future struggles. They mention their own experience with being undiagnosed and how it affected them. That shows they come from a place of concern, not malice. They also say they're not trying to force anything, just offering an option.\n\nBut the friend is the parent, so they have the final say in their child's care. The author isn't a professional, so their advice isn't a medical recommendation. The parent might feel their autonomy is being questioned, which can be a sensitive issue, especially if they've had past experiences like losing a child. The parent's resistance could stem from fear, denial, or other complex emotions. The author's nudge, while well-meaning, might come across as intrusive if not handled carefully.\n\nHowever, the author is not being confrontational. They're asking if they're the asshole, which suggests they're aware of the sensitivity. The key here is whether the author is overstepping. Since they're a friend and not a professional, their role is to support, not to diagnose. But bringing up concerns in a compassionate way isn't wrong. The parent's right to make decisions is important, but the author's concern is valid given the child's potential needs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're advocating for a child's possible well-being without being pushy. The parent's resistance doesn't negate the author's right to express concern, especially if it's done respectfully. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent is good and they're not forcing the issue.\n"
