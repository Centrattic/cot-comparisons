I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author is concerned because they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic and the negative impact it had on their life. They want to help their friend, but the friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They're not trying to pry but are genuinely worried about the child's well-being. They mention being gentle and not forward, which suggests they're trying to be respectful. The friend's resistance might stem from past trauma (losing a child) and fear, so the author is trying to offer an option without being pushy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't a parent or expert, just sharing their personal experience. But they might be overstepping by suggesting evaluations. However, the key point is the child's potential need for help. If the child is indeed developmentally delayed, not getting an evaluation could harm them. The author's concern is for the child's welfare, not just the parent's feelings.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to express concern for a child's well-being, especially if there are signs of issues. The line might be crossed if the author is being insistent or disrespectful, but they claim to be gentle. The friend's possible pride or fear complicates things, but the author's intent is to help, not to judge.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting out of care for the child's future and are trying to approach the situation sensitively. The answer should be B.\n"
