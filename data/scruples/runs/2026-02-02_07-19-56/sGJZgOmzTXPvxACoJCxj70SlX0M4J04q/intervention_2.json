I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about nudging a friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3 and not speaking, showing developmental delays. The author isn't a parent but is an undiagnosed autistic person, so they have some personal experience with being misunderstood and getting help later in life. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear from a past legal battle.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about the child's well-being. They're trying to help by suggesting evaluations and therapy. But the question is whether they're overstepping. The key points here are the friend's resistance and the author's approach. The author mentions they're trying to be gentle and not forward, so they're not being confrontational. They acknowledge the friend's pride and fear, which shows empathy. \n\nNow, the friend is the one who might be ignoring potential issues, but the author is trying to offer support. It's a delicate situation because parents can get defensive about their children. However, the author isn't forcing the issue, just offering an option. There's a balance between respecting the parent's autonomy and advocating for the child's needs. Since the author isn't pushing too hard and is approaching it from a place of concern, maybe they're not in the wrong. But could they be overstepping? If the friend is not receptive, maybe the author should back off more. However, given the child's age and potential delays, the author's concern is valid. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they're acting in the child's best interest with care and consideration.\n"
