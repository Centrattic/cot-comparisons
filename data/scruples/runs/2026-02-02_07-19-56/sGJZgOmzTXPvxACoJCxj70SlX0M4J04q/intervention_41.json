I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is not a parent or an expert, but they have personal experience with an undiagnosed autism spectrum condition. They're concerned about their friend's almost 3-year-old who isn't speaking and shows other developmental delays. The friend denies any issues, possibly out of pride or fear of losing custody after a previous loss.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the approach. The author mentions they're trying to be gentle and not forward, just gently suggesting evaluation and therapy. They acknowledge the friend's possible fears and aren't being pushy. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to respect others' autonomy. However, when there's a potential harm to a child, there's a different consideration. The author isn't forcing the friend to do anything but is offering information based on observed symptoms and their own experience. The friend is the one who dismissed the concerns, so the author isn't the one refusing help.\n\nSociety often encourages people to speak up when they notice potential dangers, especially to children. The author's concern is genuine, and they're not acting out of malice. The line is whether they overstepped by continuing to bring it up despite the friend's resistance. But the author says they're nudging gently and not being pushy. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's refusal could be due to personal trauma, and the author might be adding stress. However, the author's intention is to help, not to pry or judge. The question is whether concern outweighs the friend's autonomy. \n\nIn similar scenarios, people often debate this. If the author had no prior experience or knowledge, it might be different, but their personal experience with undiagnosed autism gives them a valid perspective. The ethical dilemma is about balancing respect for the friend's decisions with the child's well-being. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're acting out of care and are trying to approach the situation sensitively. They're not being intrusive beyond expressing concern, and they acknowledge the friend's possible fears. The friend's response is dismissive, which is her choice, but the author isn't the one refusing help or causing harm. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
