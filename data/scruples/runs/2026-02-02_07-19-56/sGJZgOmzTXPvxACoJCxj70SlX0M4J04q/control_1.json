I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a friend of a mother whose child is showing developmental delays. The author, who is on the autism spectrum, is concerned and wants the mother to get her child evaluated. The mother is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing another child.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions seem genuine. They care about their friend's child and want what's best. The author mentions that their own experience with being undiagnosed affected their life, so they want to prevent similar issues for the child. They're approaching the topic gently and not being pushy, which is a good sign. However, the mother is not receptive, which is understandable given her past experiences.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author overstepping? The author isn't forcing the issue, just suggesting an evaluation. The mother is the legal guardian, so ultimately the decision is hers. The author is not a medical professional, so they can't diagnose, but they can express concern. Since the author is not a parent, their advice might not be seen as authoritative, but their concern is valid given the symptoms described.\n\nThe mother's resistance could be due to personal reasons, like past trauma or pride. The author is trying to support the mother without being confrontational. In this case, the author's actions are well-meaning and appropriate. They are advocating for a child who might need help, which is a positive intent. The mother's response doesn't negate the author's right to express concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
