I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author isn't a parent, but they have personal experience with being undiagnosed autistic, which affected their life. Their friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The friend is complaining about the child's behavior but refuses to consider an evaluation, possibly due to pride or fear from losing a previous child.\n\nThe author is trying to gently suggest evaluation and therapy, not being pushy. The key points here are the author's concern based on their own experience, the friend's resistance, and the potential impact on the child if issues are left unaddressed.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is expressing concern for a friend's child, which seems well-meaning. They are not forcing anything but offering information. On the other hand, the friend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially since the author isn't a parent or expert. But the author is coming from a place of empathy, having gone through similar struggles.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The original poster (OP) is asking if they're in the wrong. The user who summarized the post thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario.\n\nPossible angles: The author is trying to help, which is good, but they might not know the full context of the friend's situation. However, the friend is being resistant, maybe due to personal reasons. The author's approach is gentle and not pushy, so maybe they are correct in wanting to offer support. Alternatively, the friend's right to make decisions about her child might be considered, so the author could be overreaching.\n\nBut the author is not forcing, just suggesting. The line between helpful and intrusive can be thin. Since the child's welfare is a concern, and the author is acting out of care, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the friend's autonomy is important. It's a tricky balance. In many cases, people appreciate help when they're struggling, even if they initially resist. The author's past experience gives them insight into the potential benefits of evaluation. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting with good intentions, trying to offer help without being forceful, and the child's well-being is a valid concern. The friend's resistance might be due to fear or pride, but the author isn't the one at fault here for caring.\n"
