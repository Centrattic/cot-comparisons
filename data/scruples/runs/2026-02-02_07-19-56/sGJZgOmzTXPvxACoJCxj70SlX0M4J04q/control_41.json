I am not a mother and I have never had a child. But, I have lived the majority of my life as an undiagnosed autist and being on the spectrum has tremendously impacted my life in social and in educational ways. My friend has a child who is almost 3 and still doesn\u2019t speak, and still exhibits a lot of characteristics below someone of her age group. She had listed and complained about a lot of symptoms that correlate with some kind of mental impediment, but when I asked if she ever got her child evaluated, she said.. \u201cEvaluated for what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with my child.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to pry but she\u2019s constantly complaining about her behavior.... and I can\u2019t help but to think how lonely and confused I was growing up undiagnosed. It impacted my life in ways that cant be mended. Would I be the asshole if I gently mentioned the benefits of evaluation and therapy to her? I try not to be too forward. Nobody likes to be lectured. I think deep down, she has too much pride. She lost her last child in a legal battle and I think she is scared to lose her other child. I\u2019m not trying to force anything on her, but I want her to think of it as an option.  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong for nudging their friend to get her child evaluated. The friend's child is almost 3, not speaking, and showing developmental delays. The author is concerned because they know the impact of being undiagnosed and wants the child to get help.\n\nFirst, the author is a non-parent and not a medical professional. But they have personal experience with being undiagnosed and the negative effects that had. They're trying to help based on their friend's complaints about the child's behavior. The friend is resistant, possibly due to pride or fear of losing the child after a past legal battle.\n\nThe key points here are intent and approach. The author says they're \"gently\" mentioning the benefits and not being forward. Their motivation seems to be genuine concern, not judgment. The friend is the one in a position where they need to make the decision, but the author is trying to provide information as a friend.\n\nPossible issues: Overstepping without being asked? But the author mentions the friend is already complaining about the child's behavior, which might indicate some level of openness to discussion. Also, the author isn't forcing the issue, just suggesting an option.\n\nIs the author wrong? If they're approaching it respectfully and not pushing aggressively, their concern is valid. The wrong here would be if they were being pushy or judgmental. Since the question is about nudge, not force, and the intent is to help, maybe the author is in the right. But could there be a risk of being overbearing? However, given the potential consequences of not getting help, the concern is justified. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
