We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for forgetting and then ignoring an agreement with their sister to use the bike. The sister, Eve, asked for the bike on Sunday for an interview before 12:00, and the author agreed to walk. But during the week, the author had to walk twice because of bike issues. Now, on the day of the interview, the author forgot and offered to use the bike until 12:30, but Eve needed it at 11:00. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict where Eve said the author is a selfish man.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday, and the author didn't remember it. That's a key point. Even though they're living together and the sister didn't remind them, the author should have been responsible enough to remember the prior commitment. The sister had a specific need (the interview) which is a significant event, and the author's forgetfulness disrupted that. \n\nThen, when the author realized the mistake, they tried to make a deal, but Eve was already late if the author used the bike after 8:30. The author's argument is that they had to walk twice already, so it's not fair. But the sister's interview is an important one-time event, while the author's classes are regular. The principle of keeping agreements is important here. \n\nThe sister's frustration is valid because she trusted the author to remember. The author's forgetfulness, even if unintentional, affected her. The sexist comment is problematic, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility. The author should have apologized for forgetting, maybe explained the situation, but taking the bike anyway after the agreement is a breach. \n\nSo, even if the sister overreacted, the author did break the agreement. They should apologize for the forgetfulness and not taking the bike. The answer is A.\n"
