We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. \n\nFirst, the context: Both siblings share a bike. The sister, Eve, asked for the bike on Sunday for an interview before noon. The author agreed to walk. However, during the week, the author had two incidents (bike lock and flat tire) where he had to walk. Then, on the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement, told Eve he could use the bike after noon, but she reminded him it was supposed to be before. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author make a valid agreement and then forget? The author agreed to walk so Eve could have the bike for her interview. But he forgot, leading to a conflict. The sister was upset because he didn't follow through. \n\nNow, the author's defense: He had to walk twice already, and this time would be inconvenient. The sister's argument is about the principle of keeping the agreement. The author didn't intentionally break the agreement but forgot. He tried to explain the situation but it escalated. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he made a commitment and didn't remember. Even if he had a reason, forgetting an agreement is a failure to follow through. The sister expected him to remember, and he didn't. However, the author didn't know about the interview time until the morning, and there was a misunderstanding. \n\nBut the main issue is that he agreed to walk, then didn't do it. Even if he had a reason, the sister's interview was time-sensitive. The author's forgetfulness led to the problem. So, he's partly at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, he should have remembered the agreement. The sister also didn't remind him, but he was the one who made the commitment. \n\nThe answer probably depends on whether keeping the agreement is more important than the inconvenience. The author's actions violated the agreement, even if unintentionally. So, he's in the wrong for not honoring the agreement. But maybe he's not a complete asshole. However, the sister's reaction was harsh, but the author still broke the agreement. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he forgot a prior agreement, leading to a conflict. Even if it was a mistake, he should have remembered.\n"
