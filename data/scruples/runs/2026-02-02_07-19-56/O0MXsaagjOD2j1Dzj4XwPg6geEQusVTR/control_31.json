We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister, Eve. \n\nFirst, the context: They share a bike. The sister asked to use it for a job interview on Monday, and the author agreed to walk. The author forgot and later told her she could take the bike after his class at 12:30. But Eve's interview was at 11:00, so the author realized they'd need to walk, which would make him late. He took the bike instead, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here. The agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind him. The author forgot and made a new offer. When Eve reminded him, he had to choose between walking (and potentially missing class) or taking the bike. He chose the bike, leading to Eve's anger.\n\nNow, evaluating responsibility. The author made an agreement but forgot. Eve didn't remind him, which might share some responsibility. However, the author didn't check the bike's availability again when he realized the conflict. He could have adjusted his plans, like leaving earlier. But his main point is that walking would be a problem for him, and he's in a situation where being late has consequences. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong for not following through on the agreement, even if he forgot. But Eve could have reminded him. The author's response after being reminded was to argue, which escalated the situation. The sexist comment from Eve was uncalled for, but the author's actions did breach the agreement. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether forgetting counts as being in the wrong. Since he agreed and then forgot, but didn't make an effort to remember, maybe he is partly at fault. However, the situation had mitigating factors like the bike issues and the immediate consequence of being late. But Eve's lack of follow-up is also a factor. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, even if unintentionally. But others might argue that Eve should have reminded him. However, typically, once an agreement is made, forgetting and not taking steps to remember makes you responsible. The author should have considered that Eve might not remind him and should have reminded himself. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
