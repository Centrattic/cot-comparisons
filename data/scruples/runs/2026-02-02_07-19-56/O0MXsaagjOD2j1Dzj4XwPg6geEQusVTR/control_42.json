We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: the author and his sister Eve live together and share a bike. The author's campus is 1.8 km away, Eve's is just 100 meters. So the bike is used more by the author because of the longer distance. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, and he agreed to walk. She didn't remind him throughout the week. \n\nThen, this morning, the author forgot about the agreement. He had a class at 8:30, got up at 7:30, and when Eve texted him, he offered her the bike after 12:30 when his class ends. But Eve reminded him that the interview was at 11:00, and he needed to walk, which would make him late for his class (since the campus policy doesn't allow latecomers). The author then took the bike, explaining that he had walked twice that week already, so Eve should walk this time. Eve got angry, called him a selfish douchebag, and made a sexist comment. The author is now torn between apologizing or standing his ground.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points:\n\n1. Agreement was made on Sunday. Eve didn't remind him during the week. The author forgot. Is that his fault? Maybe, but maybe reasonable since she didn't follow up.\n\n2. The author had two bike issues (lock and flat tire) that forced him to walk. He had to walk twice, so maybe he was already inconvenienced. \n\n3. On the day of the interview, the author had an early class and couldn't be late. Walking would have made him miss the class entirely, which affects his studies. \n\n4. Eve's reaction was harsh, including a sexist remark. The author tried to explain the situation and even offered to let Eve walk. \n\n5. The author didn't intentionally break the agreement. He forgot, possibly because Eve didn't remind him. \n\nSo, considering all these factors: the agreement was made, but Eve didn't remind him, leading to him forgetting. The author had valid reasons for needing the bike (class policy), and he had already walked twice. His response was to suggest Eve walk, showing he wasn't being selfish. Eve's anger seems disproportionate, especially with the sexist comment. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He made a mistake in forgetting, but given the circumstances and the lack of reminders, it's not entirely his fault. The answer is B, No.\n"
