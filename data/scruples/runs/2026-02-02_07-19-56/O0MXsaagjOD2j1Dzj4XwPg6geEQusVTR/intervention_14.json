We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. The context is about sharing a bike. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the author agreed on Sunday that their sister, Eve, would use the bike for a job interview before 12:00. The author was okay with walking to campus. Now, on Monday and Tuesday, the author had issues with the bike (lock stuck, flat tire) and had to walk. Then, on the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement, offered the bike after 8:30, but Eve needed it by 11:00. The author argues that walking is possible but Eve got upset, called them sexist names, and the author is now conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was there a prior agreement? Yes. Did the author forget it? Yes. Did Eve not remind them? She didn't mention it again after Sunday. However, the author had prior bike issues, which might have affected their memory or availability. The author forgot, which is a mistake, but is it their fault entirely? Maybe they were stressed from the bike problems. However, agreements should be honored unless there's a valid reason. The author didn't remember, leading to Eve missing her chance to use the bike. But Eve didn't remind them, which could be a factor. The author tried to explain their situation, but Eve was upset about the principle. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They did forget an agreement, but maybe Eve should have reminded them. However, the author's excuse is that they were relying on a prior agreement and had no reminders. In such cases, sometimes people expect others to remember. The author didn't intentionally break the agreement, but they did forget. Maybe they should have set a reminder or checked with Eve. The author's actions led to Eve not getting the bike when needed. So, they might be partly at fault. However, if Eve didn't follow up, that's her responsibility too. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author did forget, but the situation is a bit murky. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is at fault. I need to decide if it's A or B. The answer is probably A (Yes, author is wrong) because they didn't follow through on an agreement they made, even though they forgot. However, considering Eve didn't remind them, maybe it's shared responsibility. But the question is only about the author. Since they made a commitment and failed to honor it, even unintentionally, it's a breach. So, A is the answer.\n"
