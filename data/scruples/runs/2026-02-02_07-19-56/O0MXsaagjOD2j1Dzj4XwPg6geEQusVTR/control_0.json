We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for forgetting and then ignoring an agreement with their sister regarding bike usage. \n\nFirst, looking at the context: The sister Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview, which was agreed upon on Sunday. The author agreed to walk to their campus, which is further away. However, they forgot about the agreement when Eve texted them the next morning, leading to a conflict.\n\nImportant points to consider: The agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author during the week. The author had already walked twice, which might have contributed to their frustration. On the day of the interview, the author overslept a bit, leading to a tight schedule. They didn't remember the agreement and offered the bike after their class, but Eve needed it earlier. The author then took the bike, leading to Eve's anger and a sexist remark.\n\nFactors to consider: Did the author have a duty to remember the agreement without reminders? Eve didn't remind them, so maybe the expectation was too high. However, the author did confirm the agreement on Sunday, so forgetting might be a lapse in responsibility. Also, the author's reasoning about walking not being a big deal for Eve might be dismissive of her needs. Additionally, the author's follow-up message about Eve's sexist comment might have escalated things.\n\nOn the other hand, Eve could have reminded the author, especially since the interview was time-sensitive. The author's situation with needing to be on time for class adds another layer. The author's actions were based on forgetting, not intentional disregard. However, the principle of the agreement is important here. Did the author respect the agreement even when they forgot?\n\nPotential arguments for the author being in the wrong: They forgot an agreement they had confirmed, leading to Eve not getting the bike when needed. The author might be seen as not taking the agreement seriously, even if it was a mistake. Also, dismissing Eve's need by saying walking isn't a big deal could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nArguments against the author being in the wrong: Eve didn't follow up, the author was in a tight time situation, and the author made an honest mistake. The principle of the agreement being important might be overruled by the practical situation. The author tried to communicate but couldn't adjust in time.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's forgetfulness and subsequent decision to take the bike without considering the prior agreement is a breach of trust or responsibility. Since they had a prior agreement and forgot, even if unintentionally, they didn't honor it. Eve's reaction might have been harsh, but the author's actions did impact the agreement. The author could have tried to resolve it differently, like taking the walk that day despite the time constraints. However, given the time constraints and the need to attend class, it's a tough spot.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be seen as partially at fault for forgetting the agreement, even if it was unintentional. But Eve's overreaction and sexist remark are also problematic. However, the initial question is about the author's responsibility. Since they had an agreement and forgot, leading to a conflict, the author might share some blame. But since it was a forgetful mistake, maybe not entirely their fault. However, in terms of accountability, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not honoring the agreement despite the forgetfulness.\n"
