We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a bike that they share with their sister. They had an agreement on Sunday where they agreed the sister could use the bike for a job interview before noon, and he would walk. But he forgot about it and then when reminded, he was going to use the bike again because he had an early class where walking would make him late. Then there's the argument about it.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday. He agreed to let her use the bike for her interview, and he would walk. The problem is that he forgot and didn't remember when she reminded him. Now, forgetting an agreement is a common issue. But the sister wasn't reminding him during the week, so maybe she should have been more proactive. But he also didn't remember the agreement. He had a class at 8:30, so getting up early, and when he saw the message, he thought he could take the bike until 12:30. But she reminded him that the interview was at 11, so he would be late if he used the bike.\n\nHe mentions he had to walk twice that week, so maybe he's trying to balance the bike usage. But the original agreement was that he would walk on Sunday. The sister's argument is about the principle of sticking to the agreement. He forgot, so he's not keeping his word. Even if he had to walk twice, the sister had a valid need for the bike on Monday and Tuesday, but maybe he didn't know that. He didn't know about the flat tire and the stuck lock. Wait, no, the sister didn't tell him about her previous issues. Wait, the author had the bike issues, not the sister. The sister's interview was on a specific day, but the author had his own problems with the bike. \n\nWhen he forgot the agreement, he offered to take the bike and then got defensive when she reminded him. He also made a comment about her walking being manageable. The sister got upset, called him a sexist comment. The author then says that walking shouldn't be a big deal for her. \n\nSo, from his side, he forgot an agreement. From her side, she didn't remind him, but maybe she expected him to remember. The question is whether he's at fault for forgetting and not keeping his word. Even if the situation was tight (walking vs. bike), the principle of the agreement matters. He made a deal and didn't follow through, leading to a conflict. The sister felt betrayed, and he didn't take her needs into account despite the prior agreement. \n\nAlso, his response about her walking being a small price to pay might have been dismissive. Even if he had a valid reason, the agreement was already made. So, the main issue is the broken agreement. The sister had a valid need, he agreed, then broke the agreement. He should have remembered. The fact that she didn't remind him doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to remember. So, he is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
