We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation with their sister. So, the author and their sister share a bike. The sister, Eve, asked last Sunday that she could use the bike for an interview before 12, and the author agreed to walk. But then, the author forgot and thought they had agreed to give the bike to Eve after their class at 12:30. When Eve reminded them, the author took the bike again, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author made a mistake. They did forget the agreement, which is a common human error. But did they have an obligation to follow through? Since they had made an agreement, even if it was verbal, there's an expectation that they would honor it. The key points are: Did the author intentionally break the agreement? The answer seems to be no\u2014they forgot. However, Eve didn't remind them during the week, which might be a factor. \n\nThe author had already walked twice that week, so they might be justifying their decision. But the problem is that they made a prior arrangement. The sister's frustration is understandable because she relied on the agreement. The author's response to her reminder was dismissive, suggesting she should have reminded them earlier. But is it the sister's responsibility to remind? Maybe, but the author still agreed to the initial arrangement.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the sister's sexist remark might have escalated the situation. However, the core issue is the forgotten agreement. The author did take the bike without considering the prior agreement, even if they forgot. So, while the author is not malicious, they did break the agreement. But is that enough to be in the wrong? \n\nIn terms of responsibility, agreements, even verbal ones, create expectations. The author should have remembered or checked the agreement before taking the bike. The fact that Eve didn't remind them doesn't absolve the author of the responsibility. The author also didn't consider that Eve needed the bike for an important interview, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason for needing the bike for their class, which had a strict attendance policy. But the problem is that they didn't check the agreement first. So it's a mix of forgetfulness and not following through on a prior commitment. \n\nIn summary, the author made a mistake (forgetting), but did they do something wrong? They should have remembered, but it's a slip. However, the sister's reaction might have been harsh, but her reliance on the agreement is valid. The author's response to her was dismissive, which is not good. So, the author might be partially at fault for not honoring the agreement, even if it was a forgetful mistake. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances. Alternatively, maybe the sister is overreacting, but the author did forget the agreement. So, splitting the responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made a verbal agreement and forgot, leading to a breach, they are at least partially wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
