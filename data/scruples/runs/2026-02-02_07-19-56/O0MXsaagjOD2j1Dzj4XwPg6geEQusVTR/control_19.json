We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with his sister. \n\nFirst, the context: They live together, share one bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use the bike for a job interview on a specific day (Monday) and they agreed. The author forgot and then, when reminded, offered the bike after his class, which was after her interview time. She got upset, he took the bike, she made a sexist remark, and now he's torn.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did they have a valid agreement? Yes, they agreed on Sunday that Eve could use the bike for her interview. He forgot, which is an oversight. But he didn't intentionally break the agreement. However, he didn't remind himself, and she didn't remind him. But she had the chance to remind him during the week but didn't. \n\nHe had already walked twice that week due to bike issues, so when he had to walk again, maybe he felt it was unfair. But the agreement was specific for her interview. His response was to offer the bike after his class, which was too late. Then he took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nHe forgot, but did he have a valid reason? He was under stress with bike problems, but that's not an excuse for forgetting a prior agreement. However, the sister didn't follow up, which could be a factor. \n\nHe tried to explain the situation, saying he was going to be late. But the principle is about keeping an agreement. Even if the situation was inconvenient, he had agreed. His sister's frustration is understandable. His response of telling her to walk was dismissive, maybe. \n\nThe sexist remark from her is definitely wrong, but that doesn't negate the original agreement. The user is now questioning if he should apologize.\n\nSo, was he in the wrong? Partially. He forgot an agreement, didn't follow through, and then took the bike despite the prior plan. Even if the sister didn't remind him, the agreement was his responsibility once made. His reaction of saying she could walk was perhaps inconsiderate. So, maybe he's partially at fault. However, the sister didn't remind him, and he had valid reasons (stress, etc.), but that's not an excuse. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because he broke an agreement, even if unintentionally. But there's nuance. Since the question is whether he's the asshole, and in AITA contexts, forgetting an agreement without reminders is often seen as the person at fault. So, answer A.\n"
