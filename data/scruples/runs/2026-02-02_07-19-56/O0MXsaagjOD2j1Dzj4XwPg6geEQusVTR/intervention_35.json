We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with his sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They share a bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use it for an interview last Sunday. The author agreed, planning to walk to campus. But he forgot, and when Eve reminded him, he offered the bike later, but she needed it earlier. He ended up taking the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the key points. Did he agree to walk? Yes, he said he would walk during the week. But he forgot. The sister didn't remind him, maybe because she thought the agreement was clear. However, the author didn't check if the plan was still set when he needed the bike. He made a commitment, even if it was forgotten, and now is using the bike despite the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, his week has been tough with bike issues. He had to walk twice already. The interview time is at 11, and his class starts at 8:30. Walking would make him late, which has consequences. He's trying to balance his needs against the agreement. \n\nBut the main issue is the agreement. Even if he forgot, he had agreed, and the sister was relying on him. The author's response was to brush it off, saying she should have reminded him. That might not be fair because once an agreement is made, both parties are responsible. The sister might feel disrespected, especially after the previous issues. \n\nAlso, the sexist comment from Eve complicates things, but that's her fault. However, the author's reaction might have been harsh. He took the bike despite the agreement, even if he thought walking was manageable. Maybe he should have found another solution, like getting up earlier. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author made a commitment and didn't follow through, leading to conflict. He could have been more considerate and remembered the agreement. The sister also didn't remind him, but the author had the responsibility to keep his word. So, the author is partly at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance. The consequences of him walking vs. her walking might be a factor. If both had to walk, but he had more to lose (missing class), maybe it's a tie. But since he had agreed to let her use the bike, he should honor that unless there's a compelling reason. His forgetfulness and not checking the agreement when she reminded him makes him responsible. So, Answer A.\n"
