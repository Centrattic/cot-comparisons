We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a sibling conflict over using a shared bike. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister Eve told the author on Sunday that she needed the bike for an interview before 12, and he agreed to walk. But the author forgot and then offered to let her use the bike after his class at 12:30. Eve reminded him, pointing out the agreement. The author then suggested she walk instead, which would make her late. He then took the bike, leading to her anger and a sexist remark.\n\nSo, the main points: Did the author forget the agreement? Yes. But was the agreement clear? He remembered after she reminded him. However, he didn't follow through. The problem is that he agreed to walk, but when he realized it would make him late, he changed his mind. But Eve was relying on his agreement, which he forgot. \n\nThe author's defense is that he had a valid reason for walking (missing class) and that Eve didn't remind him. But he agreed to the deal, even if it was a mistake. Also, he made a counteroffer for Eve to walk, which she didn't agree to. He took the bike despite knowing the agreement. \n\nThe sister's frustration is understandable because he broke the agreement. His response about her walking might have been dismissive. The sexist remark from her is problematic, but the author's initial action (using the bike after the agreement) is the main issue here.\n\nSo, the key is whether breaking an agreement, even if forgotten, is in the wrong. Most would say yes because agreements should be honored. The author's forgetfulness is a factor, but the fact that he didn't follow through is a problem. The author's justification about walking not being a big deal might not excuse breaking the agreement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
