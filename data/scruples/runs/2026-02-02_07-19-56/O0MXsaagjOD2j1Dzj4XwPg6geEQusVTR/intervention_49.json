We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: Both siblings live together and share a bike. The author uses the bike daily because their campus is further away. Last Sunday, they agreed that the sister, Eve, could use the bike for a job interview that day. The author agreed to walk to campus instead. However, the sister didn't remind the author of this agreement during the week, even though the author had bike issues on Monday and Tuesday, making them walk those days too.\n\nNow, the key event is on the day of the interview. The author forgot the agreement and told Eve they could use the bike after their 12:30 class. But Eve reminded them that the interview was at 11:00, so the author needed the bike earlier. The author then decided to take the bike, leading to a conflict. The author argues they had to walk because they'd already done it twice that week, but Eve was upset about the broken agreement. She made a sexist remark, which the author found offensive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider. They made an agreement, which they forgot. Even though they had a good reason (the bike issues earlier), they didn't remember the commitment. The sister didn't remind them, but the author still had a responsibility to keep the agreement. The author's excuse about not wanting to be late to class is valid, but they could have tried to resolve it differently, like getting up earlier. The author's response was to take the bike anyway, which broke the agreement. While Eve's reaction included a sexist remark, that doesn't absolve the author of their responsibility. They should have remembered the agreement and communicated better. So, the author is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, even if the sister overreacted. They should apologize for breaking the agreement, even if the sister's response was inappropriate. The answer is A.\n"
