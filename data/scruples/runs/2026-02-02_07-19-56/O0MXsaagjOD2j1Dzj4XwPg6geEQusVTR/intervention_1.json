We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The author, let's call him Max, and his sister Eve live together and share a single bike. Max's campus is further away, so he uses the bike daily. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for an interview before noon, and Max agreed to walk. But throughout the week, Eve didn't remind him of this agreement.\n\nNow, this morning, Max wakes up early for a class and forgets about the agreement. He tells Eve he can use the bike after his 12:30 class, but Eve reminds him the interview is at 11:00. Max then insists on taking the bike because walking would make him late, which could prevent him from attending the class entirely. Eve is upset, calls him sexist and selfish, and Max feels she overreacted.\n\nFirst, agreements are important. Max did agree to let Eve have the bike for her interview, but he forgot. Even if he forgot, is that his fault? Well, Eve didn't remind him, which is a point in his favor. However, agreements should be respected regardless of reminders. So maybe Eve should have reminded him, but Max's forgetfulness still means he didn't follow through.\n\nMax's reasoning is that he needed the bike because walking would make him late, which is a valid concern since missing the class is a policy issue. But Eve's interview is a one-time event, while Max's daily commute is ongoing. However, the agreement was specifically for that Sunday's interview. Max's forgetfulness led to a conflict, and he didn't honor the agreement despite knowing the time constraints.\n\nEve's reaction included a sexist remark, which is clearly wrong. But her frustration might stem from feeling that Max didn't respect the agreement. Max's response to her sexism was appropriate, but he might have handled the initial situation better. Maybe by not using the bike despite the agreement, even if it was inconvenient.\n\nIn terms of accountability, Max did agree to walk and then forgot. His forgetfulness led to the problem, even if Eve didn't remind him. So he's partially at fault for not keeping the agreement. On the other hand, Eve could have reminded him, but she didn't. So maybe it's a shared responsibility. However, since the question is about whether Max is in the wrong, and the agreement was his to honor, he should take some responsibility. Therefore, answer A.\n"
