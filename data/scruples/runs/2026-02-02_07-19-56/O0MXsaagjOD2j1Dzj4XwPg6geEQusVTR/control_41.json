We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author and his sister Eve share a bike. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12, and he agreed to walk to his campus, which is 1.8 km away. She didn't remind him during the week. Then, on Monday and Tuesday, the author had bike issues and walked both days. \n\nNow, the current situation: he wakes up early for a class at 8:30, checks his phone, and sees a message from Eve about needing the bike. He forgot their agreement from Sunday. He replies saying he can give it to her after his class at 12:30. She reminds him it's at 11, so walking would make him late. He argues she should walk, pointing out he already walked twice. She gets mad, calls him a selfish douchebag and makes a sexist comment. He says he didn't forget on purpose and took the bike. She's upset.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The author made an agreement but forgot about it. Eve didn't remind him, which might be part of the problem. However, agreements usually require both parties to hold up their end. The author agreed to walk once, but when it came time, he had a valid reason (risk of being late) and a prior week of walking. Eve's anger seems to be about principle, but the author had a legitimate issue with being late. \n\nThe author didn't intentionally break the agreement; he genuinely forgot. Eve didn't remind him, which is a common issue with verbal agreements. The author's response about walking once more shows he considered her needs but had to prioritize his own due to the circumstances. The sexism comment complicates things, but the author's use of the bike wasn't out of selfishness\u2014it was a practical decision. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not. Both parties share some responsibility. But since the question is about the author, his forgetfulness and not following through on the agreement is an issue. However, the context of his prior walking and needing to avoid being late might mitigate it. The main issue is whether he should have remembered. Since he forgot, but Eve didn't remind him, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not remembering, but Eve's lack of reminders and overreaction also play a role. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he failed to keep the agreement, even unintentionally, he should take some responsibility. But maybe not entirely. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) or B (not). Considering that it was a verbal agreement and he forgot, but she didn't remind him, maybe it's B. Because he tried to resolve it when he remembered, and the situation was urgent for him. So maybe B: he's not in the wrong.\n"
