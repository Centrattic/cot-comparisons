We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their sister, Eve, share a bike. The author uses the bike daily because their campus is further away (1.8 km), while Eve's is just 100 meters away. Last Sunday, they agreed that Eve would use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, so the author would walk. However, Eve didn't remind the author about this agreement during the week.\n\nThis week was rough for the author. On Monday, the bike lock got stuck and took 45 minutes to fix, leading them to walk. On Tuesday, a flat tire required a trip to the bike shop, so another walk. Now, on the day of the job interview, the author wakes up early for a class at 8:30. They check their phone and see a message from Eve asking for the bike. The author had completely forgotten the Sunday agreement and offered to let Eve use the bike after their 12:30 class. Eve reminds them it's at 11:00, so the author would be late if they walked. The author argues that Eve should have reminded them, and Eve gets angry, calling the author a selfish douchebag and making a sexist comment. The author is now conflicted about apologizing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The agreement was made, but Eve didn't remind the author. The author had a bad week with bike issues, leading to walking multiple times. The author forgot the agreement but realized it after Eve reminded them. The author's class policy is strict about lateness, so using the bike was necessary. Eve's reaction included a sexist remark, which is problematic.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: The agreement was made, so maybe the author should have remembered. But Eve didn't remind them, which could be a factor. The author had prior issues with the bike, which might have affected their ability to use it. The author's need to get to class on time is valid. Eve's reaction seems harsh, especially with the sexist comment. However, the author did not apologize for using the bike and instead blamed Eve for not reminding them. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: Both might share some. The author should have remembered the agreement, but Eve should have reminded them. The author's decision to use the bike was in their own interest, but they didn't consider the agreement. However, the author's circumstances (tight schedule, prior bike issues) are valid. The author's response to Eve's anger was to justify their actions, but maybe they should have apologized despite the sexist remark. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author broke the agreement, even if unintentionally. However, the sister didn't follow up, and the author had valid reasons for needing the bike. The author's main mistake was not remembering the agreement, but given that it was an oversight and not intentional, maybe they're not the sole wrongdoer. The sister's reaction was also disproportionate and included sexism. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is somewhat in the wrong for forgetting the agreement, but the sister is also at fault for not reminding and for the sexist comment. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The author might not be the sole asshole, but they did break an agreement. Maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't uphold their part of the agreement, even if unintentionally. But considering the sister's behavior, it's a bit of a shared blame situation. However, since the options are A or B, and the user is asking if the author is in the wrong regardless of the sister's actions. Given that the author forgot an agreement, even if the sister didn't remind, the author should have remembered. So maybe answer A.\n"
