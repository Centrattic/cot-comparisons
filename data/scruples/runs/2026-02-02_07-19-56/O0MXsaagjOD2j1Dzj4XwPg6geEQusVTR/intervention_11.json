We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is asking if they should apologize for using the bike despite an agreement with their sister.\n\nFirst, the context: They live together, share a bike. On Sunday, they agreed that the sister needed the bike for an interview before noon, so the author would walk. The sister didn't remind him during the week. The author had issues with the bike lock and a flat tire, leading to walking. Then, on the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement and offered the bike after noon. The sister reminded him, but the author took the bike because walking would make him late for class. The sister got upset, called him sexist things, and the author is now torn.\n\nSo, key points: They had an agreement, even if it wasn't written. The author forgot. The sister didn't remind him, which is a factor. Walking is time-consuming and the author had a valid reason to use the bike (avoiding being late). But the author broke the agreement. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, they had an agreement, so forgetting doesn't absolve the breach. On the other, the sister didn't remind him, which is a contributing factor. The author also had prior bike issues, making walking necessary. However, the author didn't consider the sister's need for the bike first. The sister's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions broke the agreement. \n\nIn AITA cases, accountability is key. Even if the sister didn't remind him, the author agreed. So, maybe the author is partially wrong for not following through. But the sister's lack of reminders and the author's valid need to avoid being late also matter. However, agreements require both parties to uphold them. The author should have remembered or communicated if they couldn't fulfill it. Since they forgot, they're in the wrong. But perhaps the sister could have been more understanding. However, the author's choice to take the bike despite the agreement is the main issue. So, answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
