We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister (Eve) and the author sharing a bike. They had an agreement on Sunday where the author agreed to walk to campus so Eve could use the bike for a job interview. But the author forgot and then didn't honor the agreement, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement aspect. The author agreed to walk, but forgot. Even if they forgot, the agreement was made, so not honoring it could be seen as a breach. However, the author had a valid reason\u2014needing to get to class on time without being late, which is a real consequence. The campus policy about not letting late people in adds urgency.\n\nThen there's the context of the week. The author had two days where they had to walk because of bike issues. That might make the author more reluctant to walk again. Eve didn't remind them, which is a point the author makes. Did Eve have a responsibility to remind them? Maybe, but once an agreement is made, both parties can expect it to be followed unless circumstances change. The author might have thought the agreement was for a specific instance, but maybe Eve expected it to be a firm arrangement.\n\nThe author's response to Eve's reminder was to push back, saying it's not a big deal for Eve to walk. But Eve's job interview is more critical, so the author's attitude might be perceived as dismissive. The author also made a sarcastic comment about Eve having to get up earlier, which could be seen as insensitive. \n\nEve's reaction, especially the sexist remark, was inappropriate, but that doesn't absolve the author. The author did not follow through on the agreement, even though they had a reason. However, they didn't intentionally break the agreement. The question is whether forgetting and not honoring the agreement makes them an asshole. \n\nIn these situations, sometimes expectations are high about keeping agreements, even if there were extenuating circumstances. The author might be in the wrong for not following through, but there's nuance because of the timing and the consequences. The author's reasoning for needing the bike (not getting in late) is valid, but Eve's need for the bike was also important for her interview. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author did make a commitment they forgot. Even if they had a reason, the principle of honoring agreements is important. However, the author didn't intentionally break the agreement, and the situation was stressful. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is about being the asshole, the answer would hinge on whether forgetting and not honoring the agreement is sufficient. I think the author is partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, the options are A or B. Since the user initially thought the author is wrong, but others might argue otherwise. \n\nIn the end, the author made a promise and forgot it. That's a mistake, but not necessarily being an asshole. The key is whether they should have known. They had a valid reason, but the agreement wasn't followed. So maybe A is correct. But some might say B because they didn't mean to. Hmm.\n"
