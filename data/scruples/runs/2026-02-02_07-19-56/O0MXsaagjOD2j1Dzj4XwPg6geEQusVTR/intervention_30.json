We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister named Eve and the author sharing a bike. They live in the same city and study on different campuses. The author uses the bike daily because their campus is 1.8 km away, while Eve's is just 100 meters. Last Sunday, Eve asked to borrow the bike for a job interview that morning, and the author agreed to walk. But the author forgot and let Eve know they could have the bike after 12:30, which Eve needed before 11. The author then took the bike to class, causing Eve to miss her interview or have to walk a long way.\n\nFirst, the key points are the agreement made on Sunday. The author agreed, and Eve didn't remind them. The author's week had bike issues, leading to walking twice already. When Eve's interview came up, the author forgot the agreement, thought they could walk again, but realized walking would make them late. Eve was upset because the author didn't follow through on their agreement. The author is now considering whether to apologize or stand their ground.\n\nSo, was there an agreement? Yes, they had one on Sunday. The author agreed to walk so Eve could use the bike. The author forgot, but Eve didn't remind them. Now, the author is in a situation where using the bike is necessary to avoid being late for class. But the agreement was a mutual understanding. The author's reasoning is that Eve didn't remind them, and they had already walked twice. But the agreement was specific to the interview. The author's main issue is that they didn't remember, but they had to prioritize their own class. However, the author's actions broke the agreement they made. Even if Eve didn't remind, the author had a prior promise. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that walking again isn't a big deal for Eve, but Eve's job interview is important, and the author's forgetfulness caused a problem. The author's response to the sexist comment and the principle argument might not help, but the core issue is the broken agreement. The author forgot, but that doesn't make it okay. If an agreement is made, even if one party forgets, the other might rely on it. The author's responsibility is to follow through unless there's a valid reason. Here, the author needed the bike for their own class, but the agreement might have been conditional on the interview time. The author's mistake was forgetting, which is a key point. So, even if the author didn't intend to break the agreement, they did, and that's why Eve was upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they broke an agreement without trying to resolve it in a timely manner. They should have apologized for forgetting and then explained the situation. So the answer is A.\n"
