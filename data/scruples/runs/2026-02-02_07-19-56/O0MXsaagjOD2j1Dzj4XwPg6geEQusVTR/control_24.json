We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting an agreement with their sister about using the bike. \n\nFirst, the context: Both live at the same address, study on different campuses. The sister, Eve, needed the bike for a job interview on Monday, which was agreed upon over dinner on Sunday. The author, however, forgot this agreement and, when reminded, decided to walk, which would make him late to class. Eve then got angry and made a sexist comment.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreement, the forgetfulness, and the consequences. The author agreed to walk to campus so Eve could use the bike. But they forgot, and when reminded, they decided to take the bike, leading to Eve's frustration. \n\nThe author argues that walking isn't a big deal for Eve since she's only 100 meters from campus, implying it's easier for her. However, the author had already walked twice that week due to bike issues, so maybe they were frustrated. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? They did forget the agreement, which is a problem. Agreements, even informal ones, should be honored. But there's also context: the author forgot, not intentionally. They tried to walk twice already, leading to delays. When reminded, they faced a dilemma: being late to class (which has strict policies) or letting Eve walk. The author chose the bike, which might seem selfish, but they tried to explain their position. \n\nEve's reaction included a sexist remark, which is inexcusable. The author's response was to point that out, which is valid. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, they didn't follow through on the agreement, but it was a genuine forgetfulness. However, they could have checked the bike's availability again before assuming. The author's position is that they had a valid reason to take the bike to avoid being late. But since they had agreed, maybe they should have remembered, especially after Eve reminded them. \n\nIn terms of accountability, forgetting an agreement can be seen as a breach, but the severity depends on circumstances. The author's sister didn't remind them, which might be part of the issue. But the author also didn't take responsibility for the forgetfulness and instead countered with asking Eve to walk. \n\nOverall, the author might share some responsibility for not remembering, but Eve's sexist comment is a major issue. The author's response was to defend themselves, which is understandable. So, the answer depends on whether the author is solely to blame for the forgetfulness without considering Eve's role in not reminding them. But since agreements are supposed to be honored, even if forgotten, the author might be in the wrong for not following through, even if unintentionally. However, the situation is complex with valid points on both sides. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Given that they agreed and then went back on it, even if they forgot, they might be at fault. But the author's reasoning about the class policy and prior walks could mitigate that. Still, the fact remains that the agreement wasn't kept. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) but considering the nuances, maybe B (No) if the forgetfulness is considered an honest mistake and Eve's reaction was extreme. \n\nHmm. Decisions are tricky here. Maybe a split. But according to typical AITA standards, forgetting an agreement and not fulfilling it could make the author the asshole, especially since they didn't take into account the sister's valid need. But the sister's sexist remark is also a problem. However, the question is about the author's actions. So, they did break the agreement, so they are partly to blame. But the sister overreacted. So maybe the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for breaking the agreement, even if unintentionally.\n"
