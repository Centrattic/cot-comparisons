We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between siblings over a bike.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The sister, Eve, told the author on Sunday that she needed the bike for an interview the next day before 12 PM. The author agreed to let her have the bike and walk to campus. However, the author forgot and offered the bike after 12:30. When Eve reminded him, he was already going to be late for his class if he walked. The author took the bike, leading to a conflict where Eve accused him of being selfish.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author made an agreement with Eve but forgot it. He then didn't follow through, which caused Eve to lose her chance to use the bike for her interview. Eve had relied on that agreement. The author also didn't remind Eve during the week, which could have helped keep the agreement fresh. The author's forgetfulness led to a breach of the agreement, which is his fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had walked to campus twice that week already, which was inconvenient. The timing of the interview (11 AM) and the author's class (8:30 AM) meant that if he took the bike, he might not have time to make his class, as walking would take 25-30 minutes each way. The school policy about being late and not allowed in the class adds another layer. The author had to make a quick decision under time pressure.\n\nBut here's the thing: the agreement was made on Sunday, and the author didn't hold up his end. Even if he had a reason (being late), he was the one who didn't remember the prior agreement. Eve's issue is about the principle of the agreement being broken. The author could have tried to find a solution, like leaving earlier, but he didn't consider that until after the fact. Also, the author's response about Eve having to walk if she wanted the bike might not be fair because the original agreement was for her to use the bike, not the other way around. The author's forgetfulness and then prioritizing his own needs over the agreement could be seen as dismissive of Eve's needs.\n\nAdditionally, Eve's anger included a sexist remark, which was inappropriate, but the author's actions led to the conflict. The author should take responsibility for forgetting the agreement and not holding up his end, even if the situation was inconvenient. Apologizing would show accountability, especially since Eve was relying on that agreement for her job interview, which is a significant event.\n\nSo, the author is at least partially at fault for not remembering and not following through on the agreement. While the circumstances (time constraints, prior inconveniences) are understandable, the principle of keeping an agreement is important. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
