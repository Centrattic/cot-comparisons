We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister Eve. \n\nFirst, the context: They share a home and a bike. The sister needed the bike for an interview on Monday, which they agreed on Sunday. The author forgot and then refused to walk, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the main points. The agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author during the week. The author forgot, probably because they were busy or stressed, given the bike problems earlier in the week. Then, when reminded, they refused to walk, even though Eve's interview was at 11 AM, and the author's class started at 8:30. Walking would mean the author would be late, which has consequences (can't enter class). The author argues that Eve should have reminded them, and they offered to walk if necessary but now think Eve overreacted.\n\nNow, considering responsibility: Did the author forget the agreement? Yes. Did they have a valid reason? They didn't intentionally break the agreement. However, they might have not considered Eve's needs in the moment. But Eve didn't remind them during the week, which could be a point. Also, the author had prior bike issues, so maybe they were relying on the bike to avoid being late again.\n\nBut in terms of fairness, agreements between siblings often require mutual respect. Even if Eve didn't remind, the author should have remembered. Maybe they could have found a solution, like taking the bike and letting Eve walk once. But the author took the bike, leading to Eve's frustration. The sister's anger might be justified because the agreement was made, and the author didn't follow through. However, the author's reason (not wanting to be late) is valid. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to weigh if forgetting counts as being at fault. If the author had a valid reason for the oversight and tried to explain it, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, Eve's point about the principle of keeping agreements is important. The author might need to apologize for forgetting, even if the situation was complex. \n\nBut the key is whether the author was wrong. Since they didn't intentionally break the agreement, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, the author did ignore the agreement once reminded. So, maybe they're in the wrong for not honoring it, even if they forgot. Alternatively, maybe Eve is at fault for not reminding enough. \n\nIn the end, the author should have remembered, and even if they had a valid reason for needing the bike, they broke the agreement. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong). But the user is conflicted. The author's situation is complicated, but the agreement was made, and they didn't hold up their end. So, perhaps A is the answer.\n"
