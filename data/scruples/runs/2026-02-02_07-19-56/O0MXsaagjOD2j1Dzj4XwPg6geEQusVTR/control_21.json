We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and then ignoring an agreement with their sister regarding bike usage.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister, Eve, agreed with the author on Sunday that she could use the bike for an interview before noon, so the author planned to walk. However, the author forgot this agreement and, when reminded, offered the bike after 12:30, which wouldn't work for Eve's 11 AM interview. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict where Eve felt the author didn't uphold the agreement.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author did agree to let Eve have the bike, but forgot. Eve didn't remind them during the week, but the author still had the responsibility to remember. The author's excuse is that they forgot, not that they intentionally broke the agreement. However, the author's sister accused them of being selfish and made a sexist remark, which escalated the situation. The author did try to make a new arrangement (after 12:30) but it didn't fit Eve's needs. The author also mentioned they had walked twice already, which might be a mitigating factor.\n\nBut the core issue is the original agreement. Even if the author forgot, they still didn't follow through on the original plan. They should have remembered the agreement they made, especially since it was important for the interview. The author's response to Eve's reminder was to offer a later time, which wasn't helpful. The author's sister was upset because the agreement wasn't honored. So, while it's a forgetful mistake, the author did not fulfill the agreement they had made, leading to Eve's frustration. \n\nHowever, the author did acknowledge the mistake and tried to explain their situation. The sister's response, including the sexist comment, complicates things. The author might not be entirely at fault because Eve didn't remind them, but they still had the responsibility to remember. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but the author's forgetfulness led to breaking the agreement, which is a problem. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but it's not entirely clear. Alternatively, considering that Eve didn't remind them and the author tried to make a new arrangement, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the agreement was made, and the author had the duty to remember it. So leaning towards A.\n"
