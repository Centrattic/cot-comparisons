We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a shared bike between the author and their sister, Eve. The key points are the agreement made on Sunday where the author agreed to let Eve use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, so the author would walk. But the author forgot and when Eve reminded them, the author had already left for class and was going to be late because walking would take too long. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author throughout the week. The author might have forgotten because of the busy week with bike issues. But agreements, even if not repeated, still hold. The author didn't make an excuse until Eve reminded them. However, the author had valid reasons for needing the bike that morning due to the class policy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did forget the agreement. Even if it was unintentional, not remembering an agreement can be seen as a breach. But maybe Eve should have reminded the author, especially since she had a specific time. The author's response was to prioritize their own class, which is important, but maybe they should have found a way to honor the agreement despite the inconvenience. \n\nEve's reaction included a sexist remark, which was inappropriate, but the author's initial action of forgetting the agreement is a problem. The author could have been more considerate by recalling the agreement earlier and adjusting their schedule. However, given the circumstances, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author did make a mistake by forgetting the agreement, but the situation had mitigating factors like the strict class policy and Eve not reminding them. The answer might be a nuanced one, but since the question is a yes/no, I need to choose between A or B. Since the author forgot an agreement they made, even if unintentionally, they are partially at fault. However, Eve's overreaction and the author's valid need to attend class complicate things. But the main issue is the forgotten agreement. So, the answer is A.\n"
