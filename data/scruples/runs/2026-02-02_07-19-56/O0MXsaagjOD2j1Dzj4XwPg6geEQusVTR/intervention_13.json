We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister (Eve) and the author sharing a bike. They live in the same place, study at different campuses. The author uses the bike because theirs is further away. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike before 12:00 for an interview, and the author agreed to walk. But during the week, Eve didn't remind the author, and the author forgot. When reminded, the author was late for class and ended up taking the bike, causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday. Eve didn't follow up, which is a bit of a problem. But the author forgot the agreement. Even if Eve didn't remind, the author had a prior commitment they agreed to. Forgetting is human, but the key point is whether they should have remembered. \n\nThe author argues that walking is only 25-30 minutes, and Eve could do the same. But the author's class has a strict policy against being late. So the author had a valid reason to need the bike for their class. However, the original agreement was to walk, so the author breaking that might be the issue.\n\nEve's frustration is about the principle of keeping the agreement. The author didn't intentionally break it, but did so due to forgetfulness. However, the author didn't check if the bike was available when they left for class. Maybe they should have considered the agreement even if they forgot. \n\nAlso, Eve's response included a sexist comment, which is uncalled for. But the author's actions\u2014using the bike when they had agreed not to\u2014could be seen as breaking the agreement. The author might be in the wrong for not remembering, even if it was an oversight. But the circumstances (forgetting, needing the bike to avoid being late) might mitigate that. \n\nHmm. On one hand, agreements should be kept, even if not written down. On the other hand, the author had a valid reason. The fact that Eve didn't remind them complicates things. But the author was responsible to remember the agreement. So the author is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, even if it was an oversight. So answer A.\n"
