We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sister, Eve, and the author having an agreement about using a shared bike. The author forgot the agreement and used the bike when Eve needed it for a job interview. \n\nFirst, the key points to consider are the agreement and the author's actions. The agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author during the week. The author forgot and offered the bike later, but Eve needed it earlier. The author then took the bike to avoid being late for class, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author argues that walking to campus is a 25-30 minute commitment, and they had already walked twice that week. Eve, on the other hand, felt the agreement was important regardless of the circumstances. The user is unsure if apologizing is necessary or if Eve overreacted.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The agreement was made, but the author forgot. Eve didn't remind them, which might be a factor. The author tried to accommodate by offering the bike after their class but realized they needed it earlier. The author's main issue was forgetting the agreement, which led to a conflict. \n\nHowever, the author didn't intentionally break the agreement. They might have been under stress from the previous bike issues. The response from Eve included a sexist remark, which complicates things. The author didn't intentionally ignore the agreement; it was a genuine forgetfulness. \n\nIn such cases, the expectation of an agreement's importance versus the circumstances matters. Since the author didn't maliciously break the agreement, but Eve had the opportunity to remind them and didn't, the blame isn't entirely on the author. However, forgetting an agreement is a mistake, so there's some responsibility. \n\nThe answer probably hinges on whether the author should have remembered. If the agreement was clear, then the author is partially at fault. But Eve's failure to remind could also play a role. However, the author's use of the bike without remembering the agreement is the main issue here. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author is in the wrong for forgetting the agreement, even if unintentionally. They should have remembered and either taken the walk or communicated better. Eve's reaction was harsh, but the author's action was a breach of the agreement. So the answer would be A.\n"
