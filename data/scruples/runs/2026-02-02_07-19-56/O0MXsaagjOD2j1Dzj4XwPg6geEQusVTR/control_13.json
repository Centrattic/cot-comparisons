We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their sister, Eve, live together and share a bike. The sister asked for the bike last Sunday for a job interview the next day, and the author agreed to walk. But then, the author forgot and only remembered when Eve reminded them the next morning. The author had a class at 8:30, so they initially said they could give the bike after their 12:30 class, but Eve reminded them that the interview was at 11, meaning the author would be late if they walked. The author ended up taking the bike, leading to Eve getting upset and making a sexist comment.\n\nFirst, the author made an agreement with Eve, which they forgot. Even though they didn't mean to forget, the fact that they didn't remember a prior agreement could be seen as careless, especially since Eve didn't remind them during the week. The author agreed on a specific time frame for the bike use, so forgetting that and not following through might be considered breaking the agreement. However, the author had valid reasons for being in a rush due to the class time. But since they had already agreed, maybe they should have taken extra steps to remember, perhaps setting a reminder or something.\n\nEve did get upset and made a sexist remark, which is definitely not okay. But the author's part is about whether they broke an agreement. The author argues that they had to walk twice already that week, so it's not a big deal now. However, the agreement was made for the interview, which is a significant occasion for Eve. The author's forgetfulness led to a conflict, and even if they tried to explain the situation, not following through on the agreement might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the author didn't apologize immediately but instead made a comment about Eve walking might have escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, Eve didn't remind them during the week, so maybe she should have been proactive. But the initial agreement was clear. The author had to make a choice in the morning, and they chose their own class over the sister's interview. It's a bit of a tight spot, but the agreement was made, and the author didn't follow through, leading to Eve feeling let down. The author's response about walking not being a big deal might not consider Eve's urgency for the interview. So, perhaps the author is at fault for not honoring the agreement, even if it was an oversight. But maybe there's some middle ground here. The author could have tried to find a compromise, like taking the bike but lending it to Eve after their class, even if they were late. But the author didn't do that; they took the bike and left, which might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author did make a mistake by forgetting the agreement and not finding a solution that respects both their needs. So, they might be in the wrong. However, maybe not entirely because it was a forgetful mistake, but still, they should have taken more responsibility. The answer might be A (Author is in the wrong) because they broke the agreement and didn't handle the situation with enough consideration for Eve's needs.\n"
