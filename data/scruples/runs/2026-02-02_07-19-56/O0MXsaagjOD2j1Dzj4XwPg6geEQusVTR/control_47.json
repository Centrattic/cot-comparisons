We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their sister Eve share a bike. The sister had previously agreed to use the bike for an interview, but the author forgot and then used the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, let's look at the agreement. The author and Eve had a clear agreement on Sunday where they agreed that Eve could use the bike for her interview before 12:00, so the author would walk. The author acknowledges that they forgot about this agreement. Now, forgetting an agreement is a problem, but was the agreement solid? The sister didn't remind them during the week, so maybe the author's forgetfulness is partly due to not being reminded. But the agreement was made deliberately, so the author is still responsible for keeping it unless there was a valid reason to change it.\n\nThen, when the author forgot, Eve texted in the morning for the interview. The author then offered the bike after their class at 12:30, but Eve needed it by 11:00. The author had already planned to bike, not expecting the request. The author explains that walking would make them late to class, which has a strict policy. So the author's main issue is that using the bike was necessary to avoid missing class. But the sister needed the bike for the interview. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they had already walked twice that week, it's not a big deal for Eve to walk. But the sister argues that the principle of the agreement is important. The author then goes to class by bike, leading to the sister being upset. The sister's reaction included a sexist comment, which is unfair and not acceptable, but that doesn't negate the fact that the author didn't follow through on the original agreement.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author made a promise to let the sister use the bike, forgot about it, and then when reminded, didn't honor it because it conflicted with their own needs. Even if the author had a valid reason (avoiding being late), breaking a prior agreement is still an issue. The sister's anger is understandable because the agreement wasn't a one-time thing but a mutual understanding. The author could have adjusted their schedule or found another solution to honor the agreement. However, the sister's sexist remark is definitely in the wrong, but that doesn't absolve the author of their responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not following through on the agreement, even if the sister's response was inappropriate. The author should take responsibility for forgetting and not honoring the agreement, even if the sister overreacted. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
