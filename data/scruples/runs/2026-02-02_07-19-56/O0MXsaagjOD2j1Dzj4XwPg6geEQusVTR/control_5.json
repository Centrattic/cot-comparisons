We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a bike agreement between siblings. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They live together, share one bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use the bike for an interview on Sunday, and the author agreed to walk. But during the week, Eve didn't remind him. The author had two days where the bike was unusable due to lock and flat tire, so he walked both times. Then on the morning of the interview day, the author forgot the agreement. He said he could give the bike after 12:30, but Eve needed it by 11. The author then took the bike to class, leading to Eve's anger.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the author forget the agreement, then prioritize his own need over the sister's. Eve felt he was breaking a promise, leading to the argument. He's now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nThe author's side: He says he forgot, but maybe he should have remembered. He had to walk twice before, but this time he took the bike. He argues that Eve didn't remind him, so it's her fault. But he could have proactively reminded her about the agreement. Also, he was going to be late if he walked, so he had a reason to take the bike. However, he didn't consider that Eve might need the bike for her important interview.\n\nEve's side: She relied on the agreement. Maybe she thought he'd remember. She got mad when he forgot and then took the bike. Her comment about him being a man and selfish is problematic, but she's upset because he didn't follow through. She didn't remind him, but he might still be at fault for not following up.\n\nThe key factors: Did he make a promise and then forget? Yes. But forgetting doesn't mean he's in the wrong if he didn't intentionally break the agreement. However, maybe he should have set a reminder or checked with her earlier. The fact that he had to walk twice before might have made him more reluctant to walk again, but he still agreed to it on Sunday. The problem is that he forgot and then didn't act on the agreement, leading to her missing her interview opportunity.\n\nAlso, the author sent a message saying she should have reminded him, implying it's her responsibility. But if he made the agreement, maybe the onus is on him to remember. The bike is a shared resource, so perhaps he should have been more proactive in managing it. His response to her sexist comment was appropriate, but the initial action of taking the bike might still be seen as breaking the agreement, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He forgot, but he had the bike. If he remembered the agreement later and still took the bike, that's a problem. However, if he genuinely forgot and then realized it, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, since he used the bike without considering the prior agreement, he's at fault. But the fact that he had to walk twice before might mitigate some responsibility? Not sure. The key is that he agreed to walk, so using the bike on the day of the interview is breaking that agreement. Even if he forgot, the action is what matters. So maybe he is in the wrong for not following through on the agreement, even if it was an oversight. Therefore, answer A.\n"
