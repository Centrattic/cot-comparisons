We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their sister, Eve, live together. They share one bike. The author's campus is further away (1.8 km) compared to Eve's, which is just 100 meters away. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, and the author agreed to walk to campus. However, during the week, there were issues with the bike lock and a flat tire, leading the author to walk twice. \n\nOn the day in question, the author forgot about the agreement. Eve messaged in the morning about needing the bike again. The author, thinking the interview was at 12:00, offered the bike after their 8:30 class ends at 12:30. Eve reminded them the interview was at 11:00, but the author was already en route, leading to a conflict. The author took the bike, causing Eve to be upset. Eve accused the author of being selfish and made a sexist comment. The author is now unsure if they should apologize.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The author made an agreement with Eve to give her the bike for her interview. They forgot about it, which is a problem. But there were prior issues where the author had to walk twice due to bike problems. The author had a class at 8:30 and needed the bike for transportation. Walking would make them late, which the campus policy doesn't allow. \n\nThe author's forgetfulness is a key point. Even if they had a valid reason (like the previous issues), not remembering the agreement and then not adjusting their plans accordingly is a mistake. However, Eve didn't remind them, which could be a factor. The author did mention they were going to walk twice already, suggesting they had some flexibility. But Eve's interview was time-sensitive.\n\nThe author's response to Eve's reminder included suggesting she walk, which might be seen as dismissive. However, the author's main issue was forgetting the agreement. Eve's reaction included a sexist remark, which is clearly wrong, but that doesn't absolve the author of their mistake. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the agreement was forgotten. The author should have remembered and adjusted their morning routine earlier to accommodate walking if needed. Even if the author had a valid reason, not following through on an agreement without communication is a problem. The fact that Eve didn't remind them might mitigate some blame, but the author still has responsibility for not keeping track of their commitments.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is at least partially in the wrong for forgetting the agreement. However, considering the circumstances (forgetfulness, prior bike issues, and the immediate need for the bike), it's a shared responsibility. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and their forgetfulness led to breaking the agreement, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but with nuance. But in AITA contexts, the key is whether the person is the asshole. The author's forgetfulness and not following through on the agreement, despite the circumstances, makes them at least partially responsible. The answer would be A.\n"
