We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister Eve and the author share a bike. On Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for an interview before noon, and the author agreed to walk. But the author forgot and thought they could use the bike until 12:30. Then, when reminded, the author tried to take the bike again, causing a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial agreement, the author forgetting it, and then not honoring it even after being reminded. The author had a prior commitment that they had agreed to, and now they're trying to make a new arrangement. But Eve had already planned around the original agreement. \n\nThe author's excuse is that they had a class at 8:30 and couldn't get up earlier. But Eve's interview is at 11, which requires the bike. However, the author had already agreed to walk on Sunday, knowing their campus is further away. The author also mentions walking twice that week, but that doesn't negate the prior agreement. \n\nThe sister's frustration is understandable because she relied on the agreement. The author forgetting and then trying to renegotiate at the last minute isn't fair to Eve. Even though the author was in a bad situation, they still broke a promise. The sister's anger might be intense, but the author didn't follow through. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a commitment and forgot. Eve didn't remind them, but the author still should have remembered. The principle here is about keeping agreements. The author's response that it's okay for Eve to walk that one time seems dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the original agreement. \n\nThe author's actions led to Eve feeling disrespected and the author's sister making a sexist remark might be a separate issue, but the initial problem is the broken agreement. So, the author is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement and causing a conflict. They should apologize for forgetting and not respecting the prior arrangement.\n"
