We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister about using a shared bike. \n\nFirst, the context: They live together, share one bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use it for a job interview last Sunday, and the author agreed to walk. The author uses the bike daily because their campus is further away. This week had issues with the bike lock and flat tire, leading the author to walk twice.\n\nOn the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement. When Eve texted in the morning, the author offered the bike after their own class (12:30), but Eve's interview was at 11. The author then realized the conflict, suggested Eve walk, but Eve got angry, called the author sexist names, and accused them of selfishness.\n\nSo, key points: Did the author forget the agreement, which caused a problem. The author claims not on purpose, but Eve felt wronged. The author's reasoning is that walking once isn't a big deal, but Eve's interview was time-sensitive. The author used the bike, leading to Eve possibly missing her interview or being late.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They agreed to give up the bike, but forgot. Even if it was an oversight, not intentional, they broke the agreement. However, the author had extenuating circumstances (bike issues earlier in the week). But Eve didn't remind them, which might be her fault too. However, the agreement was made on Sunday, and it's the author's responsibility to remember. Also, the author's response to Eve's reminder was defensive and maybe dismissive. Apologizing could help, but Eve's reaction was also harsh with sexist remarks.\n\nSo, the author did forget the agreement, which is a breach, even if unintentional. They should have remembered. The sister's interview is important, but the author's actions led to a conflict. The author's response was defensive, not considering Eve's perspective. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong. But maybe both sides have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering they agreed and forgot, leading to Eve's problem, the answer leans towards A.\n"
