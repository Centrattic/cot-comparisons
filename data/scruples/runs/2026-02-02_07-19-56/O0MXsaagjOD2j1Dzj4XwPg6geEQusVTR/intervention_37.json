We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister named Eve and the author sharing a bike. They live together and both go to different campuses. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12, and the author agreed to walk. The author used the bike every day since then because their campus is further away. \n\nThis week, the author had issues with the bike lock and a flat tire, which forced them to walk twice. Now, on the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement. They didn't remember until Eve reminded them in the morning. The author then said they had class until 12:30, but Eve's interview was at 11. The author suggested she walk instead, and Eve got mad, calling the author sexist and a selfish person. The author is now unsure if they should apologize.\n\nSo, the main points here are the agreement, the forgetfulness, the circumstances of the week, and the reaction from Eve. The author agreed to walk on Sunday, but forgot. Eve didn't remind them, maybe because they assumed the agreement was clear. The author had valid reasons for not remembering, given the recent bike issues. But they did use the bike again without checking, which might be seen as breaking the agreement. However, the author had to walk twice already, which might mitigate some blame. The key is whether forgetting the agreement makes them at fault. Since they had prior issues and the agreement wasn't reinforced, maybe the blame isn't entirely on them. But they did make a promise and didn't follow through, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The sister's reaction included sexist remarks, which is wrong, but the author might still be partially at fault for not remembering. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the answer is A because they didn't uphold their part of the agreement, even if it was an oversight. But maybe B because the sister didn't remind them and the situation was stressful. Hmm. I think the consensus would lean towards A because you're expected to remember agreements, even if you have a good reason. So the answer is A.\n"
