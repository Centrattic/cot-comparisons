We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a bike that the author and their sister, Eve, share. They live in the same city and go to different campuses. The author uses the bike every day because their campus is further away. \n\nLast Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before noon. The author agreed, so Eve could walk to her interview. But during the week, Eve didn't remind the author of this agreement. The author had two days where the bike was unusable due to a stuck lock and a flat tire, so they walked both times. \n\nThis morning, the author forgot about the Sunday agreement and texted Eve that they would use the bike until noon. When Eve reminded them, the author had to leave for class and couldn't walk, so they took the bike. Eve got upset, accused the author of being selfish and a man, and the author took the bike. Now, the author is wondering if they're the asshole and should apologize.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author during the week. The author forgot, which is understandable since they had two incidents with the bike that week. But the author did use the bike again, even though they had agreed to walk. However, the author's reasoning was that they had a class and walking would make them late, so they had to take the bike. \n\nOn the other hand, Eve had a valid need for the bike for the interview, which is important. The author's forgetfulness disrupted Eve's agreement, but Eve didn't follow up. The author might be in the wrong for not remembering the agreement, but maybe Eve should have reminded them. The author's response was to prioritize their own needs, which might be seen as selfish. However, the author didn't intentionally break the agreement; it was a genuine forgetfulness. Also, the author tried to compromise by saying Eve could walk, but Eve was upset about the principle. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is partially at fault for not remembering, but Eve could have reminded them. The situation is a bit of a mess. But in Reddit-style AITA, usually, if you make an agreement and forget, even if the other person didn't remind you, you're expected to follow through unless there's a valid reason. The author had a valid reason (not wanting to be late), but maybe the principle is still important. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not following through, even if unintentionally. Answer A.\n"
