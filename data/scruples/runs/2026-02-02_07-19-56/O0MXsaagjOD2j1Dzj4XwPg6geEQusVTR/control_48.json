We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their sister, Eve. They share a bike, and the author agreed to let Eve use it for a job interview on a Sunday. But the author forgot and later got into a conflict because they took the bike for themselves when they needed to get to class on time.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday. The author agreed to walk to their campus (which is 1.8 km away) so that Eve could use the bike for her interview. However, Eve didn't remind them of this agreement during the week. The author then forgot and when Eve reminded them the next morning, the author had already planned to walk again because their bike had issues on Monday and Tuesday. The author was supposed to have a class at 8:30, and walking would make them late, which their campus policy doesn't allow. \n\nSo, the author's main point is that they forgot the agreement and had a valid reason to need the bike (not wanting to be late to class, which would prevent entry). Eve, on the other hand, felt that the author broke the agreement and was being selfish, even making a sexist comment. \n\nNow, considering the agreement: the author had agreed to walk on Sunday, but forgot. Eve didn't remind them, which might be a factor. The author's forgetfulness is a key point here. They didn't intentionally break the agreement, but they did forget. The problem is that when Eve reminded them, the author was already in a situation where walking would cause a problem. \n\nThe author's argument is that they were in a bind, having already had to walk twice that week. They tried to negotiate, suggesting Eve walk to the interview instead, but that didn't work out. The sister's reaction included a sexist remark, which is problematic and perhaps unfair, but the core issue is the broken agreement. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did agree to walk, but they forgot. However, they had a valid reason for needing the bike the next day. But since they had already agreed, even if they forgot, the agreement was in place. The sister didn't remind them, but the onus might be on the author to remember. The author also tried to make up for it by offering Eve to walk, but the sister was upset about the principle. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author did forget an agreement they made. Even if they had a valid reason for needing the bike, the fact that they forgot and didn't honor the agreement is where they might be at fault. However, the sister's overreaction and sexist comment also play a role in escalating the conflict. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they forgot an agreement, even if unintentionally, maybe they are in the wrong. But the circumstances (already walking twice, needing to get to class on time) could mitigate that. \n\nI think the key here is that the author had a prior agreement but failed to remember it, leading to a conflict. Even if they had a good reason for needing the bike, the fact that they forgot the agreement they made is a problem. So, they might be in the wrong for not honoring the agreement. However, the sister's reaction could be seen as disproportionate, but that's a separate issue. The author's forgetfulness is the main issue here. So, answer A.\n"
