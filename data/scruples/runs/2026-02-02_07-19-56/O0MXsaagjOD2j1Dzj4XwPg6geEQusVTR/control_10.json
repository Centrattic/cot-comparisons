We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting an agreement with their sister to let her use the bike for a job interview.\n\nFirst, the sister Eve made the agreement on Sunday, and the author agreed to walk. However, the author forgot. Eve didn't remind them during the week, which might be a factor. The author had already walked twice that week due to bike issues, so maybe they were stressed or overworked. When the author forgot, Eve reminded them, but the author didn't follow through because they had a class and the timing didn't work. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author intentionally break the agreement? The author claims they forgot, which is understandable given the previous bike issues. However, the agreement was made a week prior, and the author didn't set a reminder or make alternative plans. On the other hand, Eve didn't follow up, which could be seen as her responsibility too. The author's argument is that they had to walk twice already and couldn't do it again, especially with the time constraint. The sister's frustration is about the principle of the agreement being broken, even unintentionally. The author's response about Eve's sexist comment and the sister not responding might add to the tension. \n\nConsidering all that, the author did forget an agreement, which is their fault, but there's context. However, the sister's overreaction includes a sexist remark, which is her fault. The author might have been in a tight spot but could have handled it better by communicating or setting a reminder. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not taking the agreement seriously enough despite the forgetfulness. Alternatively, Eve should have reminded them. It's a bit of a gray area. But the main issue is the author breaking the agreement, even if unintentionally. So the answer might be A, but maybe there's nuance.\n"
