We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a bike-sharing agreement with their sister, Eve. The user is asking if they should apologize for using the bike when they had agreed to walk to campus on Sunday.\n\nFirst, the context: They live at the same address, share one bike. The author uses it daily because their campus is further away. On Sunday, they agreed Eve could take the bike for an interview before noon, so the author would walk. But the author forgot and thought the agreement was for Eve to take it after the author's class. Then, when Eve reminded them, the author was in a rush and took the bike, leading to Eve getting upset.\n\nSo, the key points here. The agreement was made, but the author forgot. Eve didn't remind them during the week. The author had a valid reason to be in a hurry (late policy). The author had walked twice already that week and offered for Eve to walk this time. Plus, Eve made a sexist comment, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did forget the agreement. But they didn't do it on purpose. Eve didn't remind them, which might be a factor. The author also had a legitimate reason to be late for class. However, they did break the agreement, even if unintentionally. But was the agreement explicit enough? The author thought the time was 12:30, but Eve needed it at 11. Maybe the agreement was ambiguous. Also, the author had walked twice already, which might justify their stance, but Eve had a job interview which is important. The author's response to walk once more could be seen as reasonable, but they ended up taking the bike. \n\nBut the main issue is the forgotten agreement. Even if it was a mistake, the author didn't follow through. However, the sister's failure to remind them (as agreed) might share some responsibility. The author's argument that Eve should have reminded them is valid. Also, the author tried to resolve it by offering to walk again. But the sister's overreaction with a sexist comment complicates things. \n\nSo, the author might be in part at fault for forgetting, but the sister's lack of reminders and the situation's ambiguity could mitigate that. The final answer would depend on whether breaking an agreement, even unintentionally, is wrong. If the agreement was clear and the author didn't make an effort to remember, maybe yes. But given the circumstances and the sister's lack of reminders, maybe not entirely. The author's response to walk another time shows they tried to be fair, but the action of taking the bike still broke the agreement. \n\nHmm. Considering all that, maybe the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because the agreement wasn't clear, Eve didn't remind them, and the author had a valid reason to take the bike to avoid being late. The sister's actions and comments also contributed to the conflict. So the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
