We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister, Eve.\n\nFirst, the context: They live together, share a bike. On Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for an interview before 12. The author agreed to walk. But during the week, the author had two days where they walked because of bike issues. Now, this morning, the author forgot about the agreement, told Eve she could take the bike after their class (12:30), but Eve reminded them it was supposed to be before 12. The author then took the bike anyway, leading to a conflict. Eve was upset, called the author sexist remarks, and the author is now unsure if they should apologize.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did the author forget a prior agreement? Yes. Did they break the agreement? Yes. But there were extenuating circumstances. The author's justification is that walking would make them late, and they had walked twice already. Eve didn't remind them, but agreements usually require both parties to remember, right? However, the author is the one who made the agreement and then forgot. Even if the sister didn't remind, the author is responsible for their own memory. Also, the author's response was to take the bike despite the agreement, leading to Eve's frustration.\n\nThe sister's reaction included sexism, which is a problem, but the author's actions led to that. The author didn't take responsibility immediately and instead blamed Eve for not reminding. But the agreement was mutual, so the author had a duty to honor it unless there was a good reason. However, the author's situation was that they would be late to class, which is a valid concern. But maybe the solution was to communicate better with Eve earlier, instead of just taking the bike.\n\nIn the end, did the author break the agreement? Yes. But there's context. However, since they agreed on Sunday and didn't check again, the author is at fault for not following through. They should have remembered. The sister's sexism is wrong, but the author's actions led to the conflict. So, the author is in the wrong for forgetting and breaking the agreement, even if there were challenges. They should take responsibility and apologize, not just stick to their guns. So the answer is A.\n"
