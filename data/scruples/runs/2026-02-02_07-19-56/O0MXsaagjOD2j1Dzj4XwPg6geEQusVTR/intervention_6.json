We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the author and their sister, Eve, live in the same city and share a bike. The author's campus is further away (1.8 km), so they use the bike daily. Eve's campus is just 100 meters away. Last Sunday, during dinner, Eve asked to borrow the bike for a job interview scheduled before noon. The author agreed to walk to campus that day. However, throughout the week, Eve didn't remind the author about this agreement. \n\nThis week, the author had two issues: a stuck bike lock on Monday and a flat tire on Tuesday, leading them to walk both days. Now, on a new day (the current day in the story), the author wakes up early for an 8:30 class. They check their phone and see a message from Eve asking for the bike again. The author forgot about the prior agreement from Sunday and offered to let her have the bike after their 12:30 class. But Eve reminded them that the interview was at 11:00, expecting the author to walk instead of biking. \n\nThe author argues that walking would make them late to class, as the policy is that latecomers can't enter. They explain their situation, saying they had to walk twice already and offer for Eve to walk instead. Eve gets angry, calls the author sexist, and says they're selfish. The author feels Eve overreacted and is considering whether to apologize or stand their ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Agreement**: The author agreed to let Eve use the bike on Sunday for an 11:00 interview. However, Eve didn't remind them all week, and the author forgot. The author then, in the moment, made a new offer based on their current schedule and needs.\n\n2. **Forgetfulness vs. Intent**: The author didn't intend to break the agreement; they simply forgot. However, Eve had a legitimate reason to need the bike (a job interview) and expected the author to keep their word. The author's forgetfulness led to a conflict, but was it their fault for not remembering?\n\n3. **Impact on Both Parties**: The author had to walk twice already due to bike issues. Using the bike for their class is necessary to avoid being late, which could affect their education. Eve's request is for an important event (a job interview), which is also significant. However, the author had a prior agreement but didn't follow through, even if unintentionally.\n\n4. **Communication**: Eve didn't remind the author, which could be a factor. But the author also didn't check in or remember the agreement. Both might share responsibility here. However, the author did agree to the arrangement, so even if they forgot, not following through could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\n5. **Reaction and Resolution**: Eve's response (calling the author sexist and selfish) might be over the top, but her frustration is valid. The author's response that Eve should have reminded them and then taking the bike might come off as dismissive. The author's argument that walking once \"shouldn't be a big deal\" for Eve might underplay the importance of the interview, especially since Eve's campus is close, but maybe the walk isn't as trivial as the author thinks.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a commitment and forgot it. Even if it was unintentional, not following through on a prior agreement could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's need to get to class on time is valid, but they should have remembered or perhaps checked if the agreement was still in place. The fact that Eve didn't remind them doesn't absolve the author of the original agreement. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had valid reasons for their forgetfulness and the bike issues. But agreements, even if verbal and not written, are important. The author's forgetfulness led to a breach, and even if unintentional, it's a failure to honor the agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for not following through on the agreement, even if it was an honest mistake. The sister's overreaction is also a problem, but the author's actions still breached the prior agreement.\n"
