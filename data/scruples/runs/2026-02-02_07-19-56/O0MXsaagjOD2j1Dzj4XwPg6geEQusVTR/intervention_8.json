We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a bike agreement between siblings. The author and their sister, Eve, agreed on Sunday that she would use the bike for a job interview before 12, so he would walk. But he forgot and when she reminded him, he offered the bike after his class at 12:30. She needed it by 11, so walking would make her late. He ended up taking the bike, and she got upset, calling him a selfish douchebag and making a sexist comment.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had an agreement on Sunday. The author forgot, didn't mention the agreement again during the week. Eve didn't remind him. The author had a valid reason for walking before (bike lock and flat tire), but this time he had a class that wouldn't let him in if he was late. He argued that walking wasn't a big deal for her, but she needed the bike for an important interview. He used the bike, leading to her getting angry.\n\nNow, considering responsibilities: The author made a promise and forgot. Even if he had a valid reason, forgetting an agreement might be seen as not respecting it. However, Eve didn't remind him, which is also a factor. But agreements typically require both parties to communicate. The author didn't keep the agreement he made, even though he had a good reason. But he tried to explain his situation. The sister's reaction included a sexist remark, which is unfair, but the author's action of breaking the agreement might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he made a commitment and didn't follow through, even if he had a good reason. However, Eve didn't remind him. But the initial agreement was made, so forgetting is on him. He also didn't take responsibility immediately; instead, he tried to negotiate, which might have hurt her feelings. The sister's reaction was harsh, but the author breaking the agreement and not owning up to it fully could make him the asshole. However, maybe both are at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. In these AITA scenarios, sometimes people are considered in the right if they had a valid reason, but agreements are important. Since he forgot, even if unintentionally, he didn't fulfill the agreement. So maybe A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But some might say B (Not in the wrong) because of the sister's harsh reaction and his good reasons. Hmm. Need to decide based on the details.\n"
