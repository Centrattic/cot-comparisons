We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister regarding a shared bike.\n\nFirst, the context: Both siblings live together and need the same bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use the bike on Sunday for a job interview, which the author agreed to, saying they'd walk. However, the author forgot and later offered the bike after their class ends. Eve reminded them of the agreement, but the author took the bike anyway because they had a class and couldn't be late. The argument escalated with Eve calling the author sexist and selfish.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the initial agreement, the author's forgetfulness, and the consequences. The author did agree to walk on Sunday, but they forgot. Eve didn't remind them during the week, but the author might argue that it's the sister's responsibility to remind if the agreement is important. However, the author did have a class with strict attendance policy, so walking would have caused them to miss it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they had two prior weeks of walking due to bike issues, so it's not unreasonable to ask Eve to walk once. But Eve might feel that the initial agreement should be honored regardless. The user is torn between apologizing or standing their ground.\n\nPossible angles: The author forgot an agreement, which is a mistake, but the sister didn't follow up. The author had their own valid reason (class attendance) and prior walking. The sister's reaction might be seen as overreacting, especially with the sexist comment. But the author did break the agreement, even if unintentionally. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both parties have some fault. The author for forgetting and not checking in, and Eve for not reminding. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the agreement was made, forgetting it is a lapse, but the sister didn't remind. The author's decision to take the bike despite the agreement could be seen as breaking trust. However, the sister's response was harsh and included a sexist remark, which shifts some blame.\n\nIn many similar cases, people often argue that if you make an agreement, you should honor it unless circumstances are unavoidable. Here, the author's circumstances (class policy) were a factor, but they had the option to walk if they left earlier. The sister's failure to remind could be a point, but the author still went against the agreement. So, the author might be partially at fault, but the sister's reaction is also problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they broke an agreement, even unintentionally, the answer might lean towards A (yes), but the sister's overreaction complicates it. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is usually on the person asking. The author made a mistake in forgetting, but the sister's reaction is her own issue. So, the answer might be A (yes) because they broke the agreement, but the sister's response was also inappropriate. However, some might argue that the sister should have reminded them, so the author isn't entirely at fault. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is A because they broke the agreement, even if unintentionally, and the sister had a valid expectation. Alternatively, B (no) if the sister should have reminded. But typically, in such cases, the person who forgets an agreement is considered at fault unless there's a valid reason. The author's reason (class attendance) might be valid, but they had prior experience of walking. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
