We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the sister and the bike. So, the author and his sister live together, they have one bike. The sister, Eve, had agreed the previous Sunday that he would walk to campus so she could use the bike for a job interview. But he forgot and then when reminded, he tried to use the bike again because he had class and walking would make him late. Now Eve is upset.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday, and he didn't remember. He says she didn't remind him during the week. But he had two other days where he had to walk because of bike issues. Now, when she texts him the morning of about the interview, he's already planning to take the bike. He forgot the agreement, then when reminded, he's in a bind. His class policy doesn't allow late entry, so walking would make him miss it. He argues that she should have reminded him, and he tells her to walk instead. She gets mad, calls him sexist, etc.\n\nHmm. The initial agreement was made, so even if he forgot, the fact that he didn't follow through on it would be an issue. However, there's the context that he had to walk twice already. The problem is that he didn't honor the agreement he made, which Eve relied on. On the other hand, he didn't know about the interview needing the bike until the morning of, and he was in a bind because of his class. But the agreement was made a week prior, so maybe Eve should have reminded him more. But the author didn't remember, so he's responsible for the forgotten agreement. Also, the part where he says she should walk instead might not be fair since she needed the bike for an important interview. However, he ended up taking the bike, breaking the agreement. So maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't remember and didn't follow through on a prior agreement. The fact that he agreed to walk and then didn't do it could make him the asshole. But he had legitimate reasons for needing the bike. But the main point is that he forgot an agreement he made. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong), because he didn't remember the agreement and broke it. But some might argue that Eve should have reminded him more. However, he did mention that she didn't remind him during the week. Still, the agreement was his responsibility to remember. So A seems correct.\n"
