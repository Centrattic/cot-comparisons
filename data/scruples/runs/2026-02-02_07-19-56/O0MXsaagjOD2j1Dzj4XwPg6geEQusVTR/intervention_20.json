We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for forgetting and then ignoring an agreement with their sister regarding bike usage.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister, Eve, asked the author to let her use the bike for a job interview last Sunday. The author agreed, but then forgot. Eve didn't remind him during the week. The author had bike issues on Monday and Tuesday, walking both days. On the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement, offered the bike after his class, but Eve needed it earlier. The author ended up taking the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: Did the author make a valid agreement? Did he have a responsibility to remember it without reminders? Was the sister's reaction justified?\n\nThe author agrees to the arrangement on Sunday, but Eve didn't remind him. However, the author had prior issues with the bike, so maybe he was stressed or preoccupied. But even if he forgot, the agreement was made, and he has a responsibility to remember such agreements, especially when it affects someone else's plans. \n\nThe author's excuse is that he forgot and then tried to reason that Eve could walk. But walking would cause him to be late for class. However, he could have checked his phone earlier or set a reminder. The sister's frustration comes from the broken agreement, and the author's response seemed dismissive, even suggesting she should walk, which might have been the opposite of what was agreed. \n\nThe sexist remark from Eve is a red flag, but that doesn't absolve the author from the broken agreement. However, the author's reaction to the sexist comment is appropriate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when an agreement is made, even if one party forgets, the other might be expected to remind. But in this case, Eve didn't remind him, which is a point. However, the author's failure to follow through on the agreement is still his responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He broke the agreement, even if unintentionally. His sister had a valid need, and he didn't uphold his end. The fact that he had prior issues with the bike doesn't negate the agreement. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault. However, Eve's reaction included sexism, which complicates things. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be yes, because he didn't follow through on the agreement he made, even if he forgot.\n"
