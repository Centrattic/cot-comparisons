We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author and their sister, Eve, live together and share a bike. The sister needed the bike for a job interview on a specific day, which they discussed on Sunday. The author agreed to walk to campus that day because their campus is further away. However, during the week, the author had two issues with the bike\u2014first, the lock got stuck, then a flat tire. Both times, they walked. \n\nOn the day of the interview, the author forgot about the agreement. When Eve messaged in the morning, the author offered the bike after their class at 12:30. But Eve reminded them it was at 11:00, so the author would be late if they walked. The author then suggested Eve walk instead, which she was upset about. Eve called the author a selfish douchebag and made a sexist remark. The author took the bike, leading to more arguments.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are: Did the author forget an agreement? Yes. Did they ignore it? They didn't remember until Eve reminded them. But did they have a valid reason? The author had prior issues with the bike, leading them to walk twice already. Also, the timing was tight for the author's class, where being late meant not being allowed in class. \n\nThe author's intention wasn't to break the agreement on purpose. They forgot. However, the agreement was made a few days in advance, and Eve didn't remind them. But the author did mention that Eve didn't remind them during the week. The author tried to resolve it by offering the bike after their class, but the timing conflict made that impossible. The author then suggested Eve walk instead, but Eve was already upset. \n\nThe author's actions led to a conflict, but the root cause might be the forgotten agreement. However, the author had valid reasons for needing the bike themselves (timely arrival for class). The sister's reaction included a sexist remark, which complicates things. The author might feel it's a two-way street here. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They did forget an agreement, which is a breach. But they had extenuating circumstances and tried to find a solution. Eve didn't remind them, which is also a factor. The author's use of the bike might be defensible because of the strict class policy. However, forgetting the agreement is a mistake. But was it a selfish act? The author was trying to avoid being late, which has consequences. Maybe the author should have taken more responsibility by reminding themselves or setting a note. \n\nOn the other hand, Eve had the opportunity to remind the author earlier, which she didn't do. The author's response of offering the bike post 12:30 was a good-faith attempt, but it didn't work. The author's suggestion that Eve walk instead might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, perhaps understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did make a mistake by forgetting the agreement, but it's not entirely their fault. However, they should have found a way to honor the agreement despite the conflict. Maybe they could have adjusted their schedule, like leaving earlier. But the class policy didn't allow being late. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were a breach of the agreement. Since they agreed on Sunday and forgot, it's a breach. But the author's own constraints (class policy) make it hard to honor the agreement. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author could have taken more initiative, like setting a reminder or communicating better. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some to bear. Eve didn't follow up, and the author forgot. But the author's use of the bike ultimately broke the agreement. However, the justification is that they needed to attend class, which is important. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe partially. \n\nGiven the way the question is structured, the answer should be A or B. The options are Yes (A) or No (B). The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was forgotten, but there's a valid reason for needing the bike, perhaps the answer is B (No). However, forgetting the agreement and not taking responsibility could mean Yes (A). \n\nBut considering that the author tried to resolve it by offering the bike after their class and suggested Eve walk, and the fact that Eve didn't remind them, maybe the answer is B. The author's mistake was unintentional, and they had valid reasons. The bigger issue might be Eve's reaction, including the sexist comment. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But I'm a bit uncertain. Let me check again. \n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The author forgot the agreement, but had valid reasons. The author tried to find a solution. The sister didn't remind. The author's actions led to a conflict, but maybe they aren't wholly at fault. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
