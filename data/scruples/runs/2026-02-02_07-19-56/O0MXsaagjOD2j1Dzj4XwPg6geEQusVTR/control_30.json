We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling argument over a bike.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their sister live together. They have one bike. The author's campus is 1.8 km away, while the sister's is just 100 meters. So the author uses the bike every day because it's more necessary. \n\nOn Sunday, during dinner, the sister (Eve) tells the author she needs the bike for an interview before 12 PM. The author agrees to walk to campus that day. But during the week, the author had two issues: a stuck bike lock and a flat tire, leading to walking two days. \n\nThis morning, the author wakes up, checks messages, and Eve is asking for the bike again. The author had forgotten the prior agreement from Sunday. They told Eve they could use the bike after 12:30 when their class ended. But Eve reminded them the interview was at 11 AM. The author then argues that Eve should have reminded them, and they took the bike anyway. Eve gets upset, calls the author sexist names, and the author is confused about whether they should apologize.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? \n\nLet's break it down. The main issue is forgetting an agreement. The author did agree on Sunday to let Eve use the bike for her interview. However, the author doesn't mention being reminded, and they had two prior incidents where they had to walk. When the author forgot, they made a new agreement, not knowing the previous one. But Eve was upset because the author didn't follow through on the original agreement. \n\nThe author's defense is that they had no prior reminders, had to walk twice that week, and the situation was different (the interview time was the same as the original agreement). The author also points out the sister's sexist remark. \n\nHowever, the key point is that the author made an agreement and then forgot about it. Even if they had a reason, forgetting and not keeping the agreement could be seen as being in the wrong. The sister had a valid need (job interview), which is important. The author might have thought they could rearrange, but Eve was relying on the bike for a critical event. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had to deal with bike issues and was relying on the bike for their commute. The sister didn't remind them, which is a factor. Also, the author offered to walk again, which Eve refused. \n\nBut the main issue here is that the author forgot an agreement. Even if they had a reason, not following through on a prior commitment could be seen as a breach of trust, especially for something as important as a job interview. The author's argument that Eve didn't remind them might mitigate some blame, but not entirely. \n\nEve's reaction was harsh, including sexist remarks, but that doesn't mean the author is fully in the right. The author should have remembered the agreement, even if they had a bad week. Maybe they should have set a reminder or checked more thoroughly. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who forgets an agreement is often seen as at least partially in the wrong, especially if the other party is relying on it. The author's sister had a legitimate need, and the author's forgetfulness caused a problem. The author might not be the asshole for forgetting, but they did make a mistake. The sister's overreaction (sexist comment) is wrong, but it doesn't excuse the author's forgetfulness. \n\nSo the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they broke an agreement they had made, even if unintentionally. However, some might argue that Eve should have reminded them. But in AITA, the person who forgets is usually held accountable. The author should apologize for forgetting, even if they didn't intend to. The sister's harsh response is separate, but the author's action is still in the wrong.\n"
