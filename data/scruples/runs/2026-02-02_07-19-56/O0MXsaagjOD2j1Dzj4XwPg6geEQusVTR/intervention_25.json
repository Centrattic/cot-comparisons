We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their sister, Eve. The key points are that they agreed on Sunday that Eve could use the bike for a job interview before 12 on Monday, and the author would walk. But the author forgot and told Eve she could use it after 12:30 when they had a class. Eve got upset because the author didn't follow through on the agreement, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author did make an agreement. Even if they forgot, they had committed to walking to allow Eve to use the bike. The sister reminded them of the agreement, but the author didn't honor it. The author's excuse is that walking would make them late, and they had already walked twice that week. But the problem is that the author didn't remember the agreement when they initially responded, so they didn't account for the walking time in their schedule. \n\nEve didn't remind them again during the week, but the original agreement was on Sunday. The author's responsibility is to remember their own commitments. Even if they had a bad week with the bike lock and flat tire, that doesn't excuse forgetting the agreement. The author's response was to suggest Eve walk instead, which was the same solution they were supposed to follow for themselves. But in this case, the author prioritized their own need for the bike over the agreement. \n\nAlso, Eve's frustration comes from the author breaking the agreement, not just the consequence of walking. The author's reaction was to shift responsibility onto Eve for not reminding them, which could come off as dismissive. The sister's comment about the author being a man and selfish might be a reaction to feeling disrespected, but the author's initial action of breaking the agreement is the root issue. \n\nIn terms of fairness, agreements between siblings, especially when resources are shared, require both parties to respect each other's commitments. The author did agree to walk, so even if they forgot, they should have remembered by the time Eve reminded them. The fact that they had to walk twice already doesn't negate the agreement; the agreement was specific to Eve's one-time need. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for forgetting the agreement and not following through, leading to conflict. They should have honored the agreement they made, even if it was inconvenient. Apologizing would be the appropriate response here.\n"
