We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author and their sister Eve share a bike because they live at the same address and study in the same city but different campuses. The author's campus is further away (1.8 km), so they use the bike every day. Eve's is just 100 meters away, so she doesn't need it as much. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for an interview before 12, and the author agreed to walk that day. But throughout the week, Eve didn't mention it again. \n\nThis week, the author had two days where they couldn't use the bike: Monday because the lock was stuck and Tuesday because of a flat tire. Both times they walked, which took 25-30 minutes each way. Now, today, the author had an 8:30 class and woke up at 7:30. They checked their phone and saw Eve's message that she needed the bike. The author didn't remember the agreement from Sunday, so they offered her the bike after 12:30 when their class ended. Then, Eve reminded them about the interview at 11, which the author had forgotten. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict where Eve accused them of being selfish and made a sexist remark. The author responded by saying Eve should have reminded them and that walking once isn't a big deal for her. Now they're feeling torn about apologizing.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and then using the bike despite the agreement. Let's break it down. The author made a verbal agreement on Sunday that they would walk to their campus on that day so Eve could use the bike for her interview before noon. But the author didn't remember this agreement when Eve asked again today. \n\nEve didn't remind them about the agreement during the week, even though it was important. The author had already walked twice this week, which adds context. The author's class policy is strict about lateness, so walking would have made them late. They didn't intentionally break the agreement but forgot it. However, the author's response was to say Eve should have reminded them, which might come off as dismissive. \n\nThe author's sister is upset because the agreement was for Sunday, and the author didn't follow through. Even if the author forgot, the fact that they agreed to it means they should have remembered, especially since the sister didn't remind them. The author's justification is that the sister could walk once, but the sister might see the agreement as important and expect the author to honor it regardless of their own circumstances. \n\nThe author's sister made a sexist remark, which is a red flag, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of any wrongdoing if they did forget an agreement. The author's response was to counter the sexist comment and explain their reasoning, but maybe they should have apologized for not following through, even if it was an oversight. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid reasons that day\u2014class time and the inconvenience of walking. The sister didn't check in with them during the week, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, agreements, even casual ones, are important to uphold. The author might share some responsibility for not keeping track of the prior commitment. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be a complete asshole, but they did forget an agreement they made. The sister could have reminded them, but the author should have remembered. The author's choice to use the bike despite the agreement led to a conflict, so maybe they are partially at fault. But since they didn't intentionally break the agreement and had to walk twice, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the sister's reaction included a sexist comment, which is worse. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is probably A (Yes), because even if it was an oversight, the author didn't follow through on a prior agreement. They could have set a reminder or been more considerate. The sister's part is also to blame for not reminding, but the author's forgetfulness and then taking the bike is a breach of the agreement, so they should apologize.\n"
