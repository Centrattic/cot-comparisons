We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for forgetting an agreement with their sister, Eve. \n\nFirst, the context: They share a bike, and the sister needed it for a job interview the next day. The author agreed to walk, but forgot and used the bike when needed. The sister got upset, called him sexist, and now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made an agreement to walk so Eve could use the bike. But he forgot, and when reminded, he used the bike again because he had a class with a strict no-late policy. Walking would have made him late. \n\nBut wait, the original agreement was on Sunday. The author says Eve didn't remind him during the week. The author then forgot and made a new arrangement. Eve had to remind him the next day. The author argues that walking once isn't a big deal, but Eve was upset about breaking the agreement. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was forgetting the agreement. He was supposed to walk, but he took the bike again. He didn't follow through on his end. However, there's a valid reason: his class policy doesn't allow late entry. Walking would make him late. But Eve's interview was at 11, so maybe she could have walked? The author offered that. \n\nBut the main issue is the broken agreement. Even if the author had a reason, he didn't follow through on what he agreed to. Also, he didn't check if the agreement was still valid. He might have assumed Eve forgot, but she clearly remembered. \n\nThe sister's reaction was harsh, calling him sexist, which is an issue, but the author did break the agreement. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he agreed to walk, then didn't. So yes, he's at fault for not keeping his end. But he had a valid reason (missing class) and tried to resolve it by suggesting Eve walk. \n\nBut agreements are agreements. Even if the situation is tough, the author didn't honor the agreement. So maybe he's in the wrong. However, the sister's reaction was also inappropriate with the sexist comment. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is partially at fault for not following through, but the sister's reaction is also problematic. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't follow the agreement, the answer is A (Yes), he's in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance. \n\nWait, the author says he didn't intentionally break the agreement. He forgot. But even so, he still broke it. The sister's interview was an important reason for the agreement. The author's response was to suggest she walk, but he didn't consider the impact of his actions on the agreement. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, forgetting is human, but he should have checked if Eve still needed the bike. Since he agreed, he should have made sure he remembered. So, he's at fault for not keeping the agreement. The sister's sexism is separate, but the author's action is still in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A.\n"
