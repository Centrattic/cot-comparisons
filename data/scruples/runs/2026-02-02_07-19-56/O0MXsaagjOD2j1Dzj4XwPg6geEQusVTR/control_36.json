We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with his sister regarding bike usage. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister, Eve, and the author live together and share one bike. The author uses the bike daily because his campus is further away. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview, and he agreed to walk. She didn't remind him during the week. The author then forgot the agreement when she reminded him on the day of the interview. He thought he had class until 12:30, but needed the bike. Now, Eve is upset because he took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, the lack of reminders from Eve, the author's forgetfulness, and the consequences of not walking. The author claims he had already walked twice that week, so it wasn't a big deal for Eve to walk. However, Eve's interview is a significant event, and the author's forgetfulness led to a broken agreement.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author did agree to let Eve use the bike. Even if he forgot, the agreement was made, and he should have honored it. However, Eve didn't remind him, which might share some responsibility. But the author's forgetfulness and then not following through could be seen as the main issue here. He also made a comment about Eve needing to walk, which might come off as dismissive.\n\nThe user is torn between apologizing or sticking to his stance. The question is whether he's the asshole. In similar situations, people often expect that if an agreement is made, even if forgotten, it's better to honor it. The author's response to Eve's reminder was dismissive, and his use of the bike broke their prior arrangement. Eve's frustration is understandable because relying on a shared agreement is important in such scenarios.\n\nHowever, the author's counter-argument is that he had already walked twice and couldn't walk again. But Eve's interview is a one-time event, whereas the author uses the bike daily. The principle of keeping agreements is often valued more than the inconvenience of walking once. Additionally, Eve's sexist comment was uncalled for, but the author's forgetfulness and then not following through could still make him at fault for breaking the agreement.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author did make a commitment and forgot. Even if he forgot, the responsibility to honor the agreement lies with him. His response to Eve was dismissive, and he didn't take her needs into account. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not upholding the agreement and responding in a way that dismissed her situation. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
