We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister, Eve, and the author having an agreement to use the bike on a specific day. The author forgot, and Eve got upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live together, share a bike. The sister needed the bike for a job interview last Sunday, which the author agreed to. But the author forgot, and on the day, Eve reminded him. The author then tried to explain that walking would make him late, and Eve got angry, even making a sexist comment. The author used the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the key points. The agreement was made on Sunday, but Eve didn't remind him during the week. The author had technical issues with the bike earlier in the week, which forced him to walk. When the day came, he forgot the agreement. He thought he could use the bike that morning, but Eve reminded him. The author then offered to walk but realized that would make him late, so he took the bike. Eve was upset and called him a sexist term.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Did he break the agreement? Yes, he agreed to walk, but forgot. However, Eve didn't remind him. The author had valid reasons for the previous days' issues, but this time, it's different because the interview's timing was earlier. The author claims he forgot, not intentionally breaking the agreement. \n\nEve's reaction includes a sexist remark, which is problematic. The author tried to negotiate, saying it's about the principle, but Eve's accusation that he's a selfish man because of his gender is an issue. The author's response was to point out her sexist remark, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the main issue is the agreement. The author agreed to walk, then forgot. Even if he forgot, he did break the agreement. But was it his fault? He might have had memory issues, but not reminding him was on Eve. However, agreements usually require both parties to fulfill their part. If Eve needed the bike, she might have expected him to remember, or she should have reminded him. The author's excuse is that he forgot, but forgetting is still a reason for breaking the agreement.\n\nHowever, the author had to walk twice before, so maybe he felt it was unfair. But the agreement was specific for that day. The author used the bike, which Eve needed. But the author's lateness policy makes it hard for him to walk. So he had a valid reason to take the bike. But he had agreed to walk, so the conflict arises.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author forgot, but Eve didn't remind him. Both share some responsibility. But the author used the bike, which Eve needed. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't follow through on the agreement. However, the author's reasoning about the lateness policy is a mitigating factor.\n\nBut the author's initial agreement was clear, and even if he forgot, the agreement stands. So he's in the wrong for not honoring it. However, Eve's reaction was also inappropriate with the sexist comment. But the question is about the author's actions. Since he broke the agreement, even if unintentionally, he might be in the wrong. But maybe Eve should have reminded him. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong.\n\nBut considering the context, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The agreement was made without a reminder, and the author had valid reasons for needing the bike. However, the agreement was specific, so he did break it. So the answer might be A (author is wrong). But some might argue that Eve should have reminded him. However, the standard is that once an agreement is made, both should remember. So the author is in the wrong. But given the lateness policy, maybe it's a gray area. Hmm.\n"
