We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong after forgetting an agreement with their sister about the bike.\n\nSo, the situation is that the sister, Eve, asked to use the bike for a job interview on Monday, which the author agreed to on Sunday. The author uses the bike every day because their campus is further away. But the author forgot and offered the bike later, which Eve needed earlier. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author during the week. The author had two days with bike issues, walking both times. On Monday, they forgot the agreement. The key points here are whether the author's forgetfulness is their fault and if they should have remembered without being reminded.\n\nThe author might argue that since Eve didn't remind them, they weren't at fault. But when you make an agreement, especially about something important like a job interview, it's expected to remember. Even if the sister didn't remind them, the author still has a responsibility to follow through. Forgetting is a personal responsibility. The author's excuse about having to walk twice before doesn't negate the agreement. Also, the author didn't take into account that Eve's interview time was earlier than their class, so maybe the author should have adjusted their schedule if they remembered. But since they forgot, maybe they should have tried to accommodate even if it meant getting up earlier. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction of expecting Eve to walk seems unfair because the agreement was for Eve to use the bike. The author's argument that Eve could walk is a bit of a cop-out because they had already agreed to let her use the bike. The fact that the author took the bike despite Eve's reminder shows a lack of consideration. The sister's frustration is understandable because the author didn't honor their agreement, leading to a potential negative impact on her job interview.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's sexist comment is definitely wrong, but that doesn't excuse the author's forgetfulness. The author could have handled it better by apologizing and trying to find a solution, like walking even if it meant being late. Instead, they took the bike and then dismissed Eve's concerns, leading to more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties have some faults, the author's main issue is forgetting the agreement and not taking responsibility immediately. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
