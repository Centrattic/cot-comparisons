We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. \n\nFirst, the context: They share a bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use the bike for an interview on a specific day, so the author agreed to walk. But the author forgot, gave the bike to Eve after their class, and Eve was upset because she thought he should have let her have it before noon as agreed.\n\nThe key points here are agreement, communication, and consequences. The author made an agreement on Sunday, which he forgot. Eve didn't remind him during the week. The author might have a point about Eve not following up, but forgetting an agreement is on the person who made it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he forgot and then had to deal with being late to class. Eve got angry, and he responded with a message about her being late and her sexist remark. The author is considering apologizing or standing his ground.\n\nEthically, agreements are important even in informal settings. If you make a commitment, you're responsible for remembering it, unless there's a valid reason and communication. The author forgot, which is a personal oversight. Even if Eve didn't remind him, he still agreed to the arrangement. \n\nAlso, when he realized the mistake, he tried to explain the situation, but Eve was upset. The author's response about her walking being a \"big deal\" might come off as dismissive. The fact that he had to walk twice already doesn't negate the agreement he made. \n\nThe author's justification is that he forgot, but responsibility for agreements isn't excused by forgetfulness. Eve's frustration is valid because she relied on the agreement. The author's initial response might have been defensive, which could have worsened the conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, while Eve could have reminded him, the author made a commitment and failed to uphold it. That makes him at least partially at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
