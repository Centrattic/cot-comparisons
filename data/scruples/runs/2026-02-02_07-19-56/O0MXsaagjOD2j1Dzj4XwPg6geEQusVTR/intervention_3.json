We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author and their sister Eve share a bike. They live at the same address and go to different campuses. The bike is essential for the author because their campus is 1.8 km away, while Eve's is just 100 meters away. \n\nOn Sunday, they agreed that Eve would use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, so the author would walk. But throughout the week, Eve didn't remind the author. The author had two issues with the bike: a stuck lock and a flat tire, which forced them to walk twice, each time taking 25-30 minutes.\n\nOn the day of the interview, the author was going to class at 8:30 AM, so they woke up at 7:30. They checked their phone and saw a message from Eve. They forgot about the agreement and offered to let her use the bike after their 12:30 class. Eve reminded them of the interview at 11:00, which would require the author to walk, risking being late for their class because the policy doesn't allow late entry. The author explained the problem and suggested Eve walk instead. Eve got angry, accused the author of being selfish and made a sexist remark. The author took the bike, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider. They had an agreement but forgot about it. They didn't check the details again even though they were in a different situation. However, Eve didn't remind them, and the author had already walked twice that week. The author had a valid reason to take the bike to avoid missing class. Eve's frustration might be about the principle, but the author's actions were based on their current constraints. The key points are: did the author intentionally break the agreement? They forgot, not on purpose. Eve could have reminded them. The author tried to communicate the issue and offered a solution. The author's response to Eve's sexist comment was appropriate. However, maybe the author should have made a better effort to remember the agreement despite their own issues. But given the circumstances, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely at fault, but they did forget an agreement. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with some nuance.\n"
