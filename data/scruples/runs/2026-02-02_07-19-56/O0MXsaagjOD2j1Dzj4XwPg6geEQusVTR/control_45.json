We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a bike that the author and their sister, Eve, share. The sister asked to use the bike on Sunday for a job interview before noon, and the author agreed to walk to their campus. But the author forgot about that agreement and used the bike the next day (Monday, after the sister's interview day) when the sister needed it again. Wait, no, the timeline here is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the details to make sure.\n\nThe author says that the agreement was made on Sunday for Eve to use the bike that day before 12 PM, so the author would walk. Then, during the week (Monday to Tuesday), the author had two days where the bike wasn't usable due to a lock issue and a flat tire, so they walked again. Now, the problem is this morning (Wednesday?), when the author was supposed to go to class at 8:30 AM. They woke up at 7:30, checked their phone, and saw Eve's message that she needed the bike. The author forgot the agreement from Sunday, so they initially said she could use it after 12:30 when their class ended. But Eve reminded them that her interview was at 11 AM, so the author still had time to walk. However, the author had already started their morning routine and realized they would be late. Their campus policy is strict about not allowing late entry. \n\nThe author then used the bike. Eve was upset, called them a selfish douchebag and made a sexist remark. The author is now considering whether to apologize or if they're right to stand their ground.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author make a prior agreement to walk on Sunday, but forgot? Did Eve need the bike again on a different day and the author didn't remember the agreement? Wait, no, the agreement was specific to Sunday. But in the current situation, Eve is asking for the bike on a different day (probably Monday, Tuesday, or another day when the bike was already not available due to previous issues). Wait, the original agreement was made on Sunday for her to use the bike on that day. The author's use of the bike on Monday and Tuesday was due to the lock being stuck and a flat tire, which made the bike unavailable. But the current conflict is when the author is supposed to be walking again? Wait, no. The current problem is this morning when the author had class at 8:30 and wanted to bike, but Eve needed the bike. But the original agreement was only for Sunday. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n\nThe author agreed with Eve on Sunday that she could use the bike that day (Sunday) before noon, so he would walk. Then, throughout the week (Monday and Tuesday), the bike was either stuck or had a flat, so he walked again. Now, the current conflict is on another day (maybe Wednesday) when the author is going to class early and Eve texts him that she needs the bike. The author forgot that they had made the agreement for Sunday, but now Eve is asking for the bike again. Wait, no. Wait, the original agreement was for Sunday. The problem is that the author is on a morning where he has class and Eve needs the bike. But the author didn't remember the prior agreement. However, the prior agreement was only for Sunday. Maybe the sister is now asking for the bike on a different day, and the author didn't remember that they had previously agreed to walk on Sunday. Wait, but the author is now using the bike when Eve needs it. So, the author is breaking a new agreement? Or is the sister holding them to the prior agreement on a different day?\n\nWait, the user says that the sister mentioned the job interview was at 11, so the author could have walked if they left earlier. But the author had a class at 8:30 and had started their routine. The original agreement was for the sister to use the bike on Sunday, and the author walked. Now, the sister is asking for the bike again on a different day, and the author forgot about the prior agreement. But the prior agreement was only for Sunday. The sister is now expecting the author to remember that same agreement for another day? Or maybe there was an implicit agreement that the author would always walk when the sister needed the bike?\n\nThe author's defense is that the sister didn't remind them, and they didn't remember the prior agreement. The sister is upset because the author didn't stick to the agreement. However, the agreement was only for Sunday. If the sister is now asking for the bike on another day, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if there's no prior agreement. But if the author had agreed to walk every time the sister needed the bike, then maybe they did. But according to the context, the agreement was specifically for Sunday. The sister didn't mention needing it again during the week. The author is now using the bike because they need it for class, and their campus policy is strict. \n\nThe author's point is that they forgot the agreement, but since the sister didn't remind them, they had to make a choice they thought was fair. However, the sister is upset because the author didn't honor the agreement. But if the agreement was only for Sunday, then the author isn't in the wrong. Unless the sister is now implying that the author should have continued to walk for her interviews on other days. But the original agreement was about Sunday. The sister might have assumed that the author would always walk when she needed the bike, but the author didn't make a general agreement. \n\nAdditionally, the sister made a sexist remark, which is a problem. The author tried to explain their reasoning. The sister is now upset about the principle. The author's position is that they forgot, but it wasn't intentional. The sister's reaction is angry and includes a sexist comment, which is definitely wrong. \n\nSo, the author didn't intentionally break the agreement. They forgot, and since the sister didn't remind them, they didn't know. The author's use of the bike on the current day might not be part of the original agreement. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The sister's overreaction and sexist comment are her issues. The author's response was to explain the situation and mention they had already walked twice, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
