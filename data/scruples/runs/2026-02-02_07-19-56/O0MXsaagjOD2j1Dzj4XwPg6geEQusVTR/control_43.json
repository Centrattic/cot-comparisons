We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves sharing a bike with their sister, Eve. \n\nFirst, the context: They live at the same address and share one bike. The author uses the bike daily because their campus is further away. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12, so the author agreed to walk. But during the week, there were two incidents where the author had to walk (bike lock stuck on Monday, flat tire on Tuesday). \n\nNow, the main incident happened this morning. The author forgot about the prior agreement. When Eve reminded them, the author initially said they could only give the bike after 12:30, but Eve needed it by 11. The author then suggested Eve walk, but Eve got mad, called the author sexist, and accused them of being selfish. The author took the bike to class and now is unsure if they should apologize.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Did the author agree to let Eve use the bike? Yes, on Sunday. But the author forgot. Eve didn't remind them again, maybe because she thought the agreement was set. The author forgot, which is a mistake. But the author had a valid reason for needing the bike (class that couldn't be missed). However, the author didn't check if the agreement was still in place. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they forgot and acted in the moment, thinking they could walk. But Eve needed the bike for a job interview, which is important. However, the author had to walk twice already that week, so maybe the sister should have considered that. \n\nBut the key points here are: Did the author intentionally break the agreement? No, they forgot. They tried to adjust when reminded but couldn't because of the class timing. The sister's reaction included a sexist comment, which is problematic. The author's response was to stand their ground, explaining the situation. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author did forget, which is on them, but maybe Eve should have reminded them earlier. Also, Eve's reaction with the sexist remark is definitely in the wrong. However, the original agreement was made, so the author did have a responsibility to remember. But the circumstances (class policy, prior walks) might mitigate their fault. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They forgot an agreement, which is a mistake, but they didn't intentionally break it. However, they should have taken more responsibility, maybe set a reminder or checked again. But Eve's reaction was also harsh and included a sexist comment, which is worse. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes both parties have some responsibility. Here, the author made a mistake, but Eve's reaction escalated things with an unfair accusation. So the author might not be the sole asshole. The answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they forgot, but they could have handled it better. Alternatively, both are at fault. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they forgot an agreement, maybe they are partially wrong, but Eve's reaction is worse. The community might say the author is not the asshole, but they should have remembered. So answer B for No.\n"
