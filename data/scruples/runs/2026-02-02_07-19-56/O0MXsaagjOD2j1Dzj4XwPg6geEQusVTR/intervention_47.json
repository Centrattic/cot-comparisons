We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the context: the author and their sister Eve share a bike. During a discussion on Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, so the author agreed to walk. The author then forgot this agreement and, when reminded by Eve, tried to push back, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main points here are: \n\n1. The author made an agreement with Eve to walk to campus so she could use the bike for an interview. They didn't have a written agreement, just a verbal one. \n2. The author forgot about it and initially didn't honor the agreement, leading to Eve being upset. \n3. The author then tried to justify it by saying walking wouldn't be a big deal for Eve, which Eve found frustrating. \n4. The author's response about Eve's sexist remark and the back-and-forth communication probably escalated the situation.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the agreement and follow-through. Since they verbally agreed on Sunday, the author had a responsibility to remember. Even though they forgot, the fact that they didn't follow through on the agreement is problematic. The author's justification about having to walk twice before might not excuse the broken agreement, especially when Eve needed the bike for an important event (a job interview). \n\nMoreover, the author's response to Eve's reminder was dismissive, suggesting Eve should have reminded them and that walking was okay for her. This could come off as not valuing the agreement they made. The sister's frustration is understandable because she relied on that agreement for an important commitment. \n\nThe author's argument that they didn't mean to forget doesn't absolve them of the consequence of not upholding their end of the deal. The principle of honoring agreements is important here. While the author had their own challenges (bike lock and flat tire), these were prior issues and not related to the specific agreement made on Sunday. \n\nEve's anger, including the sexist remark, is a red flag, but the author's reaction to it by countering with \"it's about the principle\" might not help resolve the conflict. The core issue remains that the author broke the agreement. \n\nIn conclusion, even though forgetting can happen, the author is still responsible for the agreement they made. They should have either set a reminder or communicated better if they couldn't fulfill it. The fact that they didn't and then tried to shift responsibility to Eve makes them at least partially responsible. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
