We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister, Eve. \n\nFirst, the context: the siblings share a bike. The bike is essential for the author to get to their campus, which is 1.8 km away, while Eve's is just 100 meters. On Sunday, they agreed that Eve could use the bike for a job interview before 12, so the author would walk. However, during the week, the author had two days where bike issues forced them to walk. \n\nNow, the main issue is that Eve didn't remind the author of the agreement until the morning of the interview. The author forgot and offered the bike after 8:30, when the author had class until 12:30. The author then decided to take the bike to avoid being late, which caused a conflict with Eve. \n\nThe author argues that walking once shouldn't be a big deal for Eve, especially since she didn't remind them. Eve felt the author broke the agreement, leading to a heated exchange with a sexist remark. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did forget the agreement, which is a human error, but they were relying on Eve to remind them. However, the author had legitimate reasons to need the bike that day. Eve didn't communicate the urgency properly. The author's decision to use the bike was to avoid missing class, which has a strict policy. \n\nBut agreements, even if not formal, usually require both parties to uphold their part. The author agreed to walk, but forgot. Even if Eve didn't remind them, the author was responsible for remembering. They could have set a reminder or checked earlier. The author's response to Eve's reminder was dismissive, suggesting Eve should walk, which might not be fair since the original agreement was for the author to walk. \n\nEve's frustration is valid because the agreement wasn't honored. The author's actions led to a breach of trust. Even though the author had their own constraints, they should have handled it with more consideration. Apologizing might be necessary to acknowledge the mistake and find a solution. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of Eve not reminding, which contributed to the problem. However, the author's forgetfulness was the direct cause. So, splitting the blame, but the author is primarily at fault for not following through on their end of the agreement, even if the circumstances were challenging. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they failed to uphold their part of the agreement despite knowing the terms and the consequences of not doing so.\n"
