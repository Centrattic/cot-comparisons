We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for forgetting an agreement with their sister Eve. \n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. They live together, share a bike, and Eve needed it for an interview on Monday. They had agreed on Sunday that she could take the bike before 12, so the author would walk. But the author completely forgot and told Eve they could take the bike after 12:30. Eve reminded them of the agreement, but the author had to walk again and might be late for class. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The agreement was made, but they forgot. Did they have a duty to remember? Well, they had a discussion where they mutually agreed, so there was an understanding. However, Eve didn't remind them, which might be a factor. The author had a valid reason for needing the bike (class at 8:30) and the walk could make them late. \n\nBut agreements, even informal ones, do matter. The author didn't communicate clearly; when Eve reminded them, the author didn't take it seriously and instead offered Eve to walk, which is a bit contradictory because they were the ones who had agreed to walk. The author might have been in a tight spot with the walk and the class policy. \n\nOn the other hand, Eve's frustration is understandable. She relied on the agreement, and the author forgot. The author's response of not taking the bike into account the agreement until reminded could be seen as dismissive. Also, the author's message about Eve having to walk might have been a bit unfair, given that they had already agreed to walk for themselves.\n\nEve's reaction, including the sexist comment, was inappropriate, but that doesn't negate the initial agreement. The author's forgetfulness led to a broken agreement, even if unintentional. However, the author had a practical reason for needing the bike. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The author didn't follow through, but Eve didn't remind them. However, the author has to take responsibility for their part. The principle of keeping agreements is important, even if there was a misunderstanding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is partially at fault for forgetting and not honoring the agreement. Even if they had a reason, the agreement was there. The fact that Eve didn't remind them doesn't absolve the author of their responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
