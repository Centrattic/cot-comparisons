We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for forgetting and then ignoring an agreement with their sister regarding the shared bike.\n\nFirst, the context: Both the author and their sister live at the same address and share one bike. The sister, Eve, had agreed with the author on Sunday that she would use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, so the author would walk to campus. However, the author forgot this agreement. The next week was rough with bike issues (lock, flat tire) leading to the author walking twice. On the day of the interview, the author forgot again, told Eve they could use the bike after their 8:30 class until 12:30. Eve reminded the author of the prior agreement. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict. Eve's frustration led to accusations of the author being selfish and a sexist comment. The author is now considering whether to apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author forget an agreement, leading to a breach? The agreement was made, but the author didn't remember. The sister didn't remind them, but the author had a valid reason to not remember (since it was a week later, and they had prior issues with the bike). However, agreements, even if not written down, are generally expected to be honored. The author's forgetfulness doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The sister had a legitimate need (job interview), and the author's use of the bike caused a conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid constraints too\u2014walking would make them late, and they had already walked twice. The sister's failure to remind the author might be a factor, but the author still agreed initially. The author's response of offering to walk once more might be seen as fair, but the fact remains they broke the prior agreement. The sister's reaction might be harsh, including the sexist comment, but that doesn't negate the author's breach. \n\nConsidering all this, the author did make a commitment and then forgot, leading to a breach. While the sister's overreaction is problematic, the author is still at fault for not following through. So, answer A.\n"
