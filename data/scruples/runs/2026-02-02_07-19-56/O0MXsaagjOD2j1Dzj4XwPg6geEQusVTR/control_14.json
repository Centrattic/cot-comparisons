We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a bike agreement between the author and their sister Eve. The author agreed on Sunday that Eve could use the bike for a job interview before noon, so the author would walk. But during the week, there were issues with the bike lock and a flat tire, causing the author to walk twice. Then, on the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement, offered the bike after 8:30, but Eve needed it by 11. The author ended up taking the bike to class, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author made a prior agreement with Eve. Even if they forgot, the responsibility is on them to remember. Eve didn't remind them, but that doesn't excuse the author from the agreement. The author's forgetfulness led to a breakdown in communication. Then, when Eve reminded them, the author tried to negotiate, saying Eve should walk instead. However, the original agreement was that the author would walk, not Eve. By changing the terms, the author didn't honor the original deal. \n\nEve's frustration is understandable because she relied on the agreement. The author's response about Eve having to walk might seem unfair since the author had to walk twice already, but the initial agreement was specific. The author's comment about Eve's sexist remark (\"I'm a man\") might have added to the tension, but the main issue is the broken agreement. \n\nApologizing would acknowledge the mistake, even if unintentional. The author didn't intend to break the agreement, but forgetting and then changing the terms shows a lack of consideration. Eve's overreaction could be due to stress from the job interview, but the author's actions still breached the initial agreement. So, the author is partially at fault here. They should take responsibility for forgetting and not honoring the agreement, even if there were extenuating circumstances.\n"
