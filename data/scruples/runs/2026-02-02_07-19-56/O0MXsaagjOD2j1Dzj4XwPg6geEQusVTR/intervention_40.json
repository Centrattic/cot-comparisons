We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nSo, the sister, Eve, and the author live together. They share one bike. The author uses the bike every day because their campus is farther away. On Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, and the author agreed to walk. However, during the week, the author had two incidents where they couldn't use the bike (bike lock stuck and flat tire), so they walked twice. \n\nOn the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement. They initially told Eve she could use it after 12:30 when the author's class ended. But Eve reminded them it was supposed to be before 12:00. The author then had to walk, which would make them late for class, which has a strict no-late policy. The author offered to walk, but Eve got mad, called them a selfish douchebag and made a sexist comment. The author then took the bike, went to class, and Eve is upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nLet me break it down. The author made an agreement to let Eve use the bike for her interview. Forgetting is a problem, but maybe the sister should have reminded them, as they didn't mention it again. However, the author had two prior instances where they walked. But on this day, walking would cause them to miss class entirely, which is a significant consequence. The author's reasoning is that they can't miss class because of a policy, so they took the bike. \n\nBut did they have a responsibility to remember the agreement? Well, agreements between siblings can be verbal and sometimes expected to be remembered. The sister might feel that once agreed, it's supposed to be honored, especially for a job interview, which is important. The author forgot, and even though the sister didn't remind them again, the author could have checked if they remembered the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason for needing the bike that day. If walking would make them late and prevent them from attending class, that's a problem. The author also tried to walk twice before, so maybe the sister should have been more understanding. But the sister's anger and the sexist comment might be over the top, but the author's actions could still be seen as breaking a verbal agreement, which is their fault for forgetting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did break the agreement by forgetting. But maybe the sister should have reminded them, especially since it was a one-time arrangement. The author's position is that they had a valid reason (not missing class) and the sister should have walked. But the sister felt the principle was important. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author did make an agreement and failed to remember it. Even if the sister didn't remind them, the author should have remembered. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, even if the sister overreacted. Alternatively, the author had a valid reason to need the bike again. \n\nBut the key is whether the agreement is binding. If you agree to something, you're expected to follow through, even if it's forgotten. The sister's main point is about the principle. The author's excuse is the consequence of missing class. But maybe the author could have adjusted their schedule to walk earlier. They mentioned that the sister could have walked, but the sister's interview is important too. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for forgetting, but the sister's reaction might be excessive. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they agreed and then broke it without a valid reason (since they had a policy that walking would make them miss class), maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the author couldn't walk without consequences, then maybe not. \n\nWait, the author had to walk twice before, but on this day, walking would make them miss class entirely. So using the bike was necessary for the author's own academic commitments. But the sister's job interview is a significant event. So there's a conflict of interests. The author made an agreement but couldn't honor it due to their own constraints. \n\nIn that case, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they couldn't fulfill the agreement due to an unavoidable reason (missing class). However, the author should have remembered the agreement and communicated better. But since they forgot, maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they made an agreement and forgot. Even if the sister didn't remind them, the author should have remembered. The fact that they had prior instances of walking doesn't excuse breaking the agreement. The author's position is that they needed the bike again, but the sister had a prior agreement. The author should have checked if the agreement was still in place, but since they forgot, they broke the agreement. So the answer is A.\n"
