We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by going through the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, the context: The author and their sister, Eve, share a bike. The author's campus is 1.8 km away, so they use the bike daily. Eve's is just 100 meters away. Last Sunday, Eve asked to borrow the bike for a job interview before 12:00, and the author agreed to walk. However, during the week, Eve didn't remind the author about this agreement. The author had two incidents (bike lock and flat tire) leading to walking to campus twice, which they mention as part of their week being \"pretty shitty.\" \n\nOn the day of the interview, the author wakes up early, checks the phone, and sees a message from Eve needing the bike. They forgot the agreement from Sunday and offered the bike after their class ends at 12:30. But Eve reminded them that the interview was at 11:00, meaning the author would have to walk instead. The author argues that walking wouldn't be a big deal for Eve, given she's only 100 meters away, and that Eve should've reminded them. The author then takes the bike to avoid being late to class, which has a strict policy against latecomers. \n\nEve gets mad, calls the author sexist names, and says they're selfish. The author responds by pointing out that walking once isn't a big deal for Eve and that the sexist comment was uncalled for. The author is now unsure if they should apologize or stand their ground.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: did the author break an agreement they made willingly? The author agreed on Sunday to let Eve have the bike for her interview, but since Eve didn't remind them, they forgot. However, the author's responsibility is to remember the agreement. The fact that Eve didn't remind them might be a factor, but the author still made a commitment. \n\nThe author's reasoning for using the bike was to attend class on time, which is important. But they had previously agreed to walk. The author's argument that walking once isn't a big deal for Eve might be valid, but Eve might feel the agreement was broken regardless. The author's response to Eve's anger included a dismissive attitude (\"it's about the principle\") and not acknowledging Eve's need. \n\nThe author's sister made a specific request, and the author had agreed. Even if they forgot, the fact that they didn't take steps to honor the agreement (like setting a reminder) could be seen as their fault. Also, the author's sister might have expected a reminder, but the author had to rely on their own memory. The author's sister's frustration is understandable because the agreement was broken, even if unintentionally. \n\nHowever, the author had extenuating circumstances (bikelock and flat tire) leading to walking twice already. But the agreement was specific to the interview day, not the previous days. The author's response to Eve's anger included a sexist remark, which is inexcusable and definitely wrong. The author's sister's frustration might have been exacerbated by the sexist comment, which is a separate issue. \n\nIn terms of the main question: Did the author forget an agreement and then ignore it? Yes. Even if they had a good reason, breaking an agreement is generally considered inconsiderate. The fact that they didn't apologize immediately and instead made excuses might make them the asshole. The sexist remark was also a poor response. However, the situation is a bit nuanced because the author had legitimate reasons for needing the bike. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is partially at fault for forgetting the agreement and not honoring it, even if unintentionally. But Eve's reaction included a sexist comment, which is also problematic. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author broke a prior agreement (even if forgotten), they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
