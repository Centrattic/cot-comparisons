We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a bike sharing agreement between the author and their sister, Eve.\n\nFirst, the context: They live together, use one bike. The author's campus is further away, so they use the bike daily. On Sunday, Eve mentions needing the bike for an interview before 12, and the author agrees to walk. However, during the week, the author had bike issues and walked twice. On the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement and took the bike, leading to conflict.\n\nKey points: The author agreed to walk, but forgot. Eve didn't remind them. The author had valid reasons (class at 8:30, needing to leave early). The author tried to communicate, but Eve was upset, calling them selfish and making a sexist comment. The author felt they had no choice but to take the bike to avoid being late, which is a valid academic policy.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The author did forget an agreement, which is a mistake. However, Eve didn't follow up as agreed. The author also had prior issues with the bike, making walking necessary. The author tried to resolve it by suggesting Eve walk instead, which shows compromise. Eve's reaction included sexism, which is problematic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They forgot an agreement, but the circumstances (prior bike issues, time constraints) and Eve's lack of reminders play a role. The author's actions were to avoid academic consequences. Eve's overreaction includes sexist remarks. The author's mistake was forgetting, but they tried to handle it. So, maybe the answer is A (author is wrong) for forgetting the agreement, but B (not wrong) because circumstances and Eve's behavior. However, AITA often considers both sides. Since the author broke the agreement, even unintentionally, they might be partly at fault. But Eve's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The act of forgetting an agreement is a mistake, but the author tried to communicate and had valid reasons. Maybe the answer is B (not wrong) because of the mitigating factors and Eve's overreaction.\n"
