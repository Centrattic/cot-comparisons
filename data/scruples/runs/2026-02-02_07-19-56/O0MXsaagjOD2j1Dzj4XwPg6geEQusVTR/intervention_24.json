We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between the author and their sister, Eve. They share a bike, and there was an agreement that the author would walk to campus so Eve could use the bike for a job interview. The author forgot about this agreement and then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement. The sister mentioned needing the bike for an interview on Sunday, and they agreed she could use it before 12. The author forgot, probably because they were dealing with other issues (bike lock and flat tire) that week. But the key point is that Eve didn't remind the author, which is a bit of a factor. However, the author had already agreed, so forgetting is on them. Even if they were stressed, they should have remembered the agreement.\n\nThen, when the author realized, they tried to push the bike usage to after their class, but Eve needed it earlier. The author then decided to take the bike despite Eve's reminder, leading to Eve's anger. The author's reasoning was that walking would be a problem for them, but Eve had to walk as well. The author's actions broke the agreement, which is a problem. The sister's frustration is understandable because agreements are important, especially when it affects her job interview.\n\nHowever, the author might argue they had valid reasons\u2014like not being reminded and the bike issues. But forgetting an agreement isn't a valid reason. Also, there's the sexist remark from Eve, which complicates things, but the author's main issue is breaking the agreement. The author's response about it being a principle might be valid, but the fact remains they didn't follow through. So while Eve's overreaction is there, the author's forgetfulness and breaking the agreement makes them at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, yes, the author is in the wrong for forgetting the agreement and not honoring it despite the circumstances. They should have remembered and found a solution, maybe by getting up earlier or something. Even if Eve didn't remind them, the agreement was made, and the author is responsible for keeping it.\n"
