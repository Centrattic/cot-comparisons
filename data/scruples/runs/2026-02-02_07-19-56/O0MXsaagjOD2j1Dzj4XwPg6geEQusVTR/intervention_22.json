We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about sharing a bike between siblings. The sister, Eve, asked to borrow the bike for a job interview on Sunday, which the author agreed to, and they both thought it was settled. But the author forgot and ended up using the bike again on Monday. There were some previous issues with the bike that made the author walk, so maybe that's part of the problem. \n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind the author during the week. The author might have genuinely forgotten, especially with the bike issues. But they had already walked twice that week, so maybe they were used to it. But the problem is that the author didn't follow through on the agreement. Even if they forgot, the fact that they agreed to walk for Eve's interview and then changed their mind when it was time could be seen as breaking the agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a class starting early and needed to get there on time. Walking would risk missing the class, and the policy is strict. The author tried to explain the situation, but Eve was upset because the author didn't remember the agreement. \n\nThe author could have considered getting up earlier to walk, but they mentioned that Eve didn't remind them. However, the author did agree to the arrangement, so maybe they have a responsibility to follow through even if they forgot. The sister's interview is important, and the author's action might have been seen as not respecting the prior agreement. \n\nEve's reaction included a sexist comment, which is definitely wrong, but the author's action of not honoring the agreement could still be in the wrong. The author might need to apologize for breaking the agreement, even if the sister overreacted. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't stick to the agreement, even if they had reasons.\n"
