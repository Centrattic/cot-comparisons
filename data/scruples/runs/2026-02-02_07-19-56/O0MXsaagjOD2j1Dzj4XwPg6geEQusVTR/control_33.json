We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their sister, Eve, live together and share one bike. The author uses it every day because their campus is 1.8 km away, while Eve's is just 100 meters away. Last Sunday, they agreed that Eve could use the bike for a job interview before 12:00, so the author would walk. But Eve didn't remind them during the week. The author had two days where the bike was unusable (locked and flat tire), so they walked those days. Now, this morning, Eve texts again about needing the bike. The author forgot the agreement, said she could take it after their 8:30 class ends at 12:30. Eve reminded them of the Sunday agreement, and the author said she should walk since they had walked twice already. Eve got angry, called the author sexist, and the author replied that walking once shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author break the agreement? The agreement was made on Sunday, and Eve didn't remind them. The author forgot, possibly because of the prior issues. But the author did use the bike, leading to Eve's frustration. The author argues that they had walked before and could do so again, but Eve's interview is at 11, and walking would make the author late. The author took the bike, leading to Eve's anger.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did forget the agreement. But they had valid reasons for walking before. Eve didn't remind them, which might be part of the problem. The author tried to communicate the issue of being late, and Eve's reaction included a sexist remark. The author's defense is that they had walked before and that Eve didn't follow up. But they did break the agreement, even if accidentally. However, considering the circumstances (forgot, had to walk before), maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But since they agreed and then broke it without checking, maybe there's some fault. However, Eve's reaction might be over the top. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the agreement wasn't explicitly communicated again and the author had reasons for walking.\n"
