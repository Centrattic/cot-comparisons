We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a bike agreement between the author and their sister, Eve. The author agreed on Sunday that Eve could use the bike for an interview before noon. However, the author forgot and then later offered the bike after their own class ended at 12:30, which would make Eve late for her 11:00 interview. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, looking at the agreement: the author agreed to let Eve have the bike before 12:00. The author forgot and only remembered when Eve reminded them. The author's main argument is that they had a class at 8:30 and needed the bike, and walking would make them late. But they also mention that they had walked twice already that week, so walking once more shouldn't be a big deal for Eve. \n\nEve was upset that the author didn't honor the agreement. The author forgot, but Eve didn't remind them during the week. However, the author might be at fault for not keeping their promise. Even if they forgot, they should have checked with Eve about the bike when they realized the time conflict. The author's response was to tell Eve to walk, but that's the same solution they had for themselves, which might not be fair. \n\nBut wait, Eve's interview was at 11:00, and the author's class was at 8:30. If the author had taken the bike, they could have used it to get to class on time, but that would mean Eve would miss her interview. The author's class policy is strict about lateness. So the author has a valid reason to need the bike early. However, the author had agreed to walk for Eve's interview, so breaking that agreement might be the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, Eve didn't remind the author about the agreement, which could contribute to the problem. But the original agreement was mutual, so both parties had a responsibility to uphold it. The author might argue that they were in a bind because of the strict class policy and had no way to reschedule. \n\nThe author's sister's reaction included a sexist remark, which is definitely wrong, but that doesn't excuse the author's actions if they were in the wrong. The author's response to Eve's reminder was to shift responsibility back to her for not reminding them. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author did agree to let Eve use the bike, and even though they forgot, they should have remembered or checked with Eve when they got the reminder. The fact that they had to walk twice already doesn't negate the initial agreement. The author's solution of making Eve walk might not be fair because Eve needed the bike for a job interview, which is a significant event. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, even if they had a valid reason. They should have found a way to accommodate Eve's need, like perhaps leaving earlier themselves or finding an alternative. The fact that they forgot and then shifted blame might make them the asshole here.\n"
