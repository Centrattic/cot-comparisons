We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author and their sister Eve share a bike. Last Sunday, they agreed Eve could use the bike for a job interview before 12, so the author would walk. But throughout the week, the author had two incidents (bike lock and flat tire) that forced them to walk. Now, this morning, the author forgot the agreement and offered the bike after their class. Eve reminded them, but the author had already started their routine and couldn't walk in time. The author then took the bike again, leading to an argument where Eve called the author sexist and a selfish person.\n\nFirst, the author did make an agreement, even if it was a week ago. They forgot, which isn't ideal, but forgetting can happen. However, the key point is that Eve didn't remind them during the week. The author mentioned that Eve didn't remind them, so maybe they expected her to bring it up again. But the author still had the responsibility to remember their own agreement. Even if the bike issues caused previous walks, the agreement on Sunday was specific for this interview. \n\nThe author's argument is that walking wasn't a big deal for Eve, but the time constraint made it impossible for them to walk and make the class. However, the author had two prior instances where walking was necessary, so maybe they thought it was manageable. But Eve's interview time was more critical. The author's decision to take the bike again after the agreement could be seen as breaking the agreement, even if unintentionally. \n\nEve did call the author sexist, which is a problem, but the author's action of using the bike despite the prior agreement might still be the issue. The author's response about Eve not reminding them might shift blame, but the agreement was made, and the author should have remembered. The fact that the author didn't check if the agreement still applied that morning (even if they forgot) could be a point against them. They should have at least verified the situation when Eve reminded them. \n\nIn the end, the author took the bike, leading Eve to feel disrespected. Even if the author had a valid reason, the agreement was to walk, and breaking it without communication could be seen as the author's fault. The sister's reaction was harsh, but the author's action still might be the problem. So, the answer is A.\n"
