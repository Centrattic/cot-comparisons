We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. \n\nFirst, the context: They share a bike. The sister, Eve, asked to use it for an interview on Sunday, which the author agreed to on the condition he'd walk. But he forgot, and when reminded, he decided to take the bike again because he had a class and didn't want to be late. Eve got upset, called him sexist, and the author is now conflicted about apologizing.\n\nSo, key points here. The author made an agreement to walk to let Eve use the bike. He forgot, and when reminded, he changed his mind. Eve felt he broke the agreement, which she saw as a principle issue. The author argues that walking once more wasn't a big deal for her, given her campus is nearby. \n\nNow, thinking about responsibility. The author agreed to the arrangement, but forgot. Maybe he should have set a reminder or checked the bike's availability again. However, Eve didn't remind him during the week, which could be a factor. The author had prior bike issues (lock and flat tire) that caused him to walk twice. So, maybe he was under stress. \n\nBut the main issue is the broken agreement. Even if he forgot, he had agreed to it. The sister might feel that once an agreement is made, it should be honored, especially since she relied on it. The author's reasoning is that he had a valid reason (not wanting to be late for class), but Eve's interview time was earlier than he thought. \n\nThe author then got defensive, and Eve made a sexist comment, which the author rightly pointed out. But the core problem is the broken promise. Was it his fault for forgetting? Maybe, but if Eve didn't remind him, that's on her too. However, agreements between siblings often require some follow-up. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, if the author had a habit of breaking agreements, it's worse. But this seems like an isolated incident. He might be in the wrong for not keeping the promise, even if unintentionally. However, Eve's reaction might be exaggerated, especially the sexist comment. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author made a mistake by forgetting and then changing his mind when reminded. Eve's frustration is valid because she relied on that agreement. The author should have honored it unless there was a compelling reason. Since he had a valid reason (not wanting to be late) but Eve's interview time was earlier, maybe he should have reconsidered. \n\nBut Eve not reminding him could be part of the issue too. However, the author's responsibility is to remember his own commitments. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he broke the agreement, even if unintentionally. But if the sister didn't remind him, that's a shared problem. However, in such situations, the person who made the agreement is expected to follow through unless there's a new valid reason. The author didn't have a new reason\u2014it was just that he forgot. So maybe he's in the wrong. Alternatively, the sister's overreaction and sexism might make the author not the asshole. \n\nHmm. Tricky. The author made a mistake but under stress. Eve's reaction was harsh. The author's defense might be valid. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The agreement was to walk once for her interview. He forgot, then changed his mind. He should have honored the original agreement unless there was a compelling reason. Since he had walked twice already, maybe he felt it was too much. But the sister's interview was a prior agreement. So, maybe he's in the wrong. But the sister's response was also problematic. The answer might be A, but some might say B.\n"
