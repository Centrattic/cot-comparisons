We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nFirst, the sister Eve and the author live together and share a bike. Their campuses are close, but the author's is further away. On Sunday, they agreed that Eve could use the bike for a job interview before 12, so the author would walk. However, the sister didn't remind him during the week. The author had a rough week with bike issues, walking twice. Then, on the day of the interview, the author forgot the agreement, offered the bike after his class, but Eve needed it earlier. The author then took the bike, leading to a conflict. The sister called him sexist and a selfish, leading to the question of who's at fault.\n\nSo, key points here: The agreement was made on Sunday, but Eve didn't remind him. The author forgot and thought the interview was after his class. The author had valid reasons (bike problems earlier, needing to avoid being late for class). The sister's frustration might be about the principle of breaking an agreement. The author didn't intentionally break the agreement but forgot. However, he did have the opportunity to check with her again if he wasn't sure. But since she didn't remind him, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely his. Also, the author tried to explain his situation and offered a solution (he was willing to walk). The sister's reaction included a sexist comment, which is problematic. The author's response was to point that out. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did break an agreement, but it was due to forgetfulness, not malice. The sister didn't remind him, which might share some responsibility. However, agreements are important, and even if forgotten, the author should have double-checked, especially since the sister didn't mention it again. But given the circumstances, like the bike issues and the tight schedule, maybe he wasn't entirely at fault. The sister's overreaction and sexist remark are on her. But the author did use the bike despite the agreement, even if he forgot. So maybe he's partially at fault, but not entirely. \n\nThe options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the situation, the author forgot but had valid reasons. The sister didn't remind him, but the author should still honor the agreement. However, he had to make a split-second decision to avoid missing class. The principle matter for the sister might be more about the agreement, but the author's actions were unintentional. So, is it a shared fault? But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he broke the agreement, even unintentionally, maybe the answer is A. However, given the context and the sister's reaction, maybe B. \n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key is whether forgetting and then using the bike without remembering the agreement makes him wrong. In many cases, forgetting isn't malicious, but if you can't remember the agreement, you might still be responsible. However, the sister didn't remind him, which complicates things. The author tried to resolve it by offering to walk, but the sister was upset. The author's actions led to a conflict, but he didn't intentionally break the agreement. So, maybe the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he forgot and tried to handle it, even though there was a conflict. The sister's reaction was more about principle and her own frustration. So the answer is B.\n"
