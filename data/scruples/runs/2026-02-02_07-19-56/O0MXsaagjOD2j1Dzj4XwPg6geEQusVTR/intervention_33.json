We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for forgetting an agreement with their sister and then using the bike. The situation involves a bike shared between two siblings. \n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday: the sister, Eve, needed the bike for a job interview before 12, and the author would walk. The author then forgot about this and agreed to let her use the bike after 12:30. But the interview is at 11, so the author ends up taking the bike to get to class on time, since walking would make them late.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, the consequences of forgetting, and the reaction. The author didn't remind Eve about the agreement, and Eve didn't ask again. But the author did forget the agreement. Even though the author had a good reason (not wanting to be late), the initial agreement was broken. \n\nThe sister got upset about the broken agreement and made a sexist comment, which was uncalled for. But the author also didn't take responsibility immediately. They tried to justify using the bike by saying Eve should have reminded them, but that seems a bit like making an excuse. \n\nThe author might have been in a bind, but the agreement was made, and forgetting it's their fault. The author could have tried to find a solution, like offering to walk even if it's inconvenient, but chose not to. So, they might be at fault for breaking the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction was harsh, especially the sexist remark. The author didn't ask for that, but the main issue is their forgetfulness. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong for breaking the agreement, even if it was an honest mistake. They should have remembered or checked again, especially since they knew Eve needed the bike. However, the sister's reaction was also problematic. But since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
