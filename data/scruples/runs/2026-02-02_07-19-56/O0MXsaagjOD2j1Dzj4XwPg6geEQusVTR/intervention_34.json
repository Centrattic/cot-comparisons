We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves two siblings sharing a single bike. The sister, Eve, had agreed on Sunday that the author would walk to campus so she could use the bike for a job interview. The author forgot about this agreement and later claimed to the sister that he wouldn't be able to use the bike because of his class schedule. The sister reminded him of the agreement, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author made an agreement with his sister to take the bike off and walk so she could use it for her interview. Even though she didn't remind him during the week, he had agreed, and forgetting is on his end. The key here is that he had a prior agreement and didn't follow through. The sister's need was specific to a time (before 12 PM), and the author didn't account for that. \n\nThen, when the sister reminded him, he tried to justify by saying he'd walked twice already, but the sister's situation was different\u2014job interview, which is more critical. The author also made a counterargument that she should have reminded him, which might shift some responsibility to her, but the original agreement was made on Sunday. The sister might be expected to reiterate if she's relying on that. However, the author still had the responsibility to remember his own agreement. \n\nThe sister's frustration is understandable; she was counting on that bike for her interview. The author then took the bike despite the agreement, which he had forgotten, leading to her being upset. His response about her sexist remark also seems to have escalated the conflict. \n\nSo, while the sister could have reminded him, the author's forgetfulness and not honoring the agreement makes him at fault. The principle here is about keeping agreements, even if the other party didn't follow up. The author's actions disregarded the prior agreement, leading to the sister's anger. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
