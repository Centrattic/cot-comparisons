We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a sibling conflict over a shared bike. The author agreed on Sunday to walk to campus so their sister could use the bike for an interview, but they forgot and took the bike when the sister reminded them. The sister was upset because the author didn't follow through, and the author is now wondering if they should apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement. The sister mentioned the arrangement on Sunday, and the author agreed. The sister didn't remind them during the week, so the author might have forgotten. However, agreements between family members often rely on mutual reminders, especially if the initial agreement isn't written down. The author had prior issues with the bike (lock and flat tire) and walked those days, but the sister didn't mention the interview again. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author forget the agreement, or was it a lack of communication? The sister didn't remind them, but the author also didn't check if they remembered the agreement. The author's excuse is that they had to walk twice already, but that doesn't negate the prior agreement. The sister felt the agreement was important, and the author didn't fulfill their part. \n\nThe author's response to the sister's reminder was to suggest she walk instead, which the sister found unfair. The sister's frustration is understandable because the author didn't hold up their end of the deal. The author's argument that it's just one time and the sister should walk might not hold because they had agreed beforehand. \n\nThe sister's remark about being a man might be a red herring or a point about the author not respecting the agreement, but that's her perspective. The author's response to the sexist comment was appropriate, but the main issue is whether they honored the agreement. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did forget, but they could have double-checked the agreement. The sister could have reminded them, but the author made the choice not to follow through. So, the author is partially at fault for not keeping the agreement, even if it was a forgetful mistake. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
