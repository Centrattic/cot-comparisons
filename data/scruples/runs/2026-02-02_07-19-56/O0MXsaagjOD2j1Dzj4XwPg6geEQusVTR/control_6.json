We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their sister sharing a bike. They had an agreement on Sunday where the author agreed to walk to campus so the sister could use the bike for a job interview. The sister didn't remind the author during the week, and the author forgot. Now, when the sister reminds the author, the author is in a situation where taking the bike would make them late for a class because walking would take 25-30 minutes, and the policy is no late entries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is at fault for forgetting the agreement. They did agree to walk, but the sister didn't remind them as the deadline approached. The author had to deal with bike issues earlier in the week, making walking necessary before. Now, the author's class is at 8:30 AM, so they have to leave early. The sister's interview is at 11 AM, but the author's class attendance is critical. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they forgot the agreement, but they had to make a choice in the moment. The sister made a sexist comment, which is a problem. The author is defending their decision based on the circumstances, but maybe they should have remembered the agreement. However, the sister didn't remind them, so maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. \n\nOn the other hand, agreements between siblings should be respected even if forgotten. The author did agree, even if it was forgotten. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's actions could be seen as breaking the agreement. The author might have a valid point about the sister not reminding them, but the fact remains that the author forgot. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did agree and then forgot. However, the sister didn't follow up. The author's situation is different now due to the time constraints. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the author didn't keep the agreement, even if it was forgotten, they might be partially at fault. But considering the sister's lack of reminders and the author's need to get to class, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The answer might depend on whether the agreement requires both parties to remind. Since the author didn't keep their part, they might be in the wrong. But the sister's reaction is also problematic. \n\nHmm. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I think the author is not in the wrong because the sister didn't remind them, and the author had a valid reason to take the bike. However, forgetting the agreement is a mistake. But the sister's failure to remind is a factor. Maybe the answer is B (No) because the author didn't intentionally break the agreement, and the sister should have reminded them. But the author did agree to walk, so maybe they are in the wrong. This is tricky. \n\nAnother angle: the author's class is important, and walking would make them miss it. The sister's interview is important too, but she didn't remind the author. The author's situation is time-sensitive. The author might have to prioritize their class since the sister didn't follow up. So maybe B (No) is the answer.\n"
