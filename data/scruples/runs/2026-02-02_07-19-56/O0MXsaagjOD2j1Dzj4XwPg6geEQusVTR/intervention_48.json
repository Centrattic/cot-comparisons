We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with their sister. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the sister Eve and the author live together. They share one bike. The sister had agreed to use the bike for a job interview on Monday, which was mentioned on Sunday. The author agreed but forgot. The sister didn't remind them, and the author ended up using the bike the next day, leading to a conflict. The author had a class at 8:30 and walked the first two days of the week due to bike issues. On the day in question, they forgot the agreement and took the bike, causing Eve to get angry for breaking the agreement.\n\nFirst, the agreement was made on Sunday. The author agreed to walk so Eve could use the bike. However, the sister didn't remind them throughout the week. When the author forgot, they had to choose between walking again and being late for class or taking the bike. The author took the bike, explaining they were late, and Eve got upset, even making a sexist comment. The author then retorted, leading to no resolution.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did they intentionally break the agreement? They forgot, not on purpose. But they did have the bike available for Eve's use. However, the author had a valid reason of needing to get to class on time without being late, which could affect their academic standing. The sister didn't remind them, which might share some responsibility. The author tried to explain the situation but Eve got upset.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did agree to the arrangement but forgot. However, Eve didn't follow up. The author had to make a split-second decision to avoid missing class. The sister's reaction included a sexist remark, which is problematic. The author's response was to point out that walking isn't a big deal for her, but the situation was urgent for them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did forget an agreement, but it wasn't intentional. However, agreements, even verbal, are important. On the other hand, the sister didn't remind them, and the author had a valid reason. The author's actions might be inconsiderate, but the sister's response was also harsh. However, the main issue is whether the author's use of the bike was the wrong choice despite the agreement.\n\nI think the author is partially at fault for forgetting, but the sister also failed to remind. However, the key is that the author broke the agreement. Even if unintentional, breaking an agreement can be seen as wrong. But the author had a valid reason. The answer might be a mix, but according to the question, it's binary. Since the author forgot, but still used the bike when they had agreed not to, maybe the answer is yes (A). But the sister's reaction was also unkind. Hmm. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong. I think the main point is that the author didn't uphold their end of the agreement, even if they had a reason. So, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
