We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister, Eve, and the author sharing a bike for their respective campuses. They made an agreement on Sunday where the author agreed to walk to campus so Eve could use the bike for a job interview. However, the author forgot about this agreement and took the bike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement itself. The author and Eve had a verbal agreement on Sunday. The author didn't remind Eve that he needed to walk, and Eve didn't remind him throughout the week. The author's forgetfulness is a key point here. Even though he forgot, he had agreed to walk, so not following through could be seen as breaking the agreement. However, there's also the aspect of Eve not reminding him, which might share some responsibility.\n\nThen there's the consequence: the author's class policy doesn't allow late entry, so taking the bike was necessary for him to attend. He also mentions having walked twice that week already. Eve's reaction included a sexist remark, which complicates things. The author had to choose between his class and her interview, and he chose his class, which could be justified given the strict policy. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is at fault for forgetting the agreement. Since agreements, even verbal ones, are binding in personal relationships, his forgetfulness might be seen as a breach. However, Eve didn't set reminders, and the situation had prior complications (bike lock and flat tire). The author's need to attend class is valid, and he tried to communicate the problem. \n\nEve's overreaction, including the sexist comment, might shift some blame to her, but the initial problem is the author not keeping his commitment. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He forgot, but he had a good reason related to his class policy. However, he should have remembered the agreement or communicated better. The fact that he agreed to walk but then took the bike without checking again could be seen as his fault. But considering the circumstances and the strict class policy, maybe not entirely. I'm leaning towards the author being partly at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not the extent. Since he broke an agreement, even if unintentionally, that's a point against him. Eve's reaction is also problematic, but the author's action still matters. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
