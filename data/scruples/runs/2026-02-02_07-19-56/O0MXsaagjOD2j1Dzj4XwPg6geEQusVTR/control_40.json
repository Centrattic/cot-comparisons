We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their sister, Eve, share a bike. They live in the same city and study at different campuses. The author's campus is 1.8 km away, while Eve's is just 100 meters. They have one bike, and the author uses it daily because their campus is further. \n\nThe key events start when Eve mentions during Sunday dinner that she needs the bike for a job interview the next day, which she says will be before 12:00. The author agrees to walk to campus that day. However, during the week, the author had two days where the bike was unusable (bikelock stuck on Monday and a flat tire on Tuesday). Both times, the author walked to campus without issues. \n\nNow, the next part is the main conflict. This morning, the author had a class at 8:30, so they wake up early. They check their phone and Eve texts that she needs the bike. The author forgot about the previous agreement and told Eve they can have the bike after their class at 12:30. But Eve reminds them that the interview is at 11:00, and the author realizes walking would make them late. The author then takes the bike, and Eve is upset, calling the author sexist and a selfish person. The author is now considering whether they're in the wrong and should apologize.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is whether the author is at fault for forgetting the agreement. The author agreed to let Eve use the bike on Sunday, but didn't remember. However, Eve didn't remind them during the week when similar situations arose (Monday and Tuesday), where the author walked. The author argues that walking should be no big deal for Eve this time. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author didn't honor the prior agreement. Even though Eve didn't remind them, the author had agreed to walk. The author's excuse is that they forgot, but agreements are supposed to be honored even if one forgets. However, there's also the fact that the author had already walked twice without the bike, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had to prioritize their own class attendance. \n\nBut Eve's interview is important, and the author had previously agreed to let her use the bike. The fact that the author forgot might be a problem. The author could have tried to find a solution, like getting up earlier to walk, even if it was a hassle. However, the author mentions that the campus policy is strict about latecomers not being allowed in, which could make walking too risky. \n\nSo, the author might have broken the agreement, but the circumstances (forgetting, no reminders, previous walking instances) might mitigate the fault. On the other hand, Eve might be right in expecting the author to follow through once an agreement is made. The author's response about Eve's sexist comment also adds tension. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author is partially at fault for not honoring the agreement, but Eve's overreaction and sexist remark are also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author did forget an agreement they had made, even if it was unintentional, they might be in the wrong. But the fact that they had to walk twice before and were in a time-sensitive situation complicates it. Alternatively, maybe Eve should have reminded them again, especially since the previous agreement was a few days ago. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural expectations around agreements and responsibility for reminders. If the agreement was verbal and not a written contract, maybe the author isn't solely at fault for forgetting, but they should have found a way to honor the agreement despite the oversight. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they broke an agreement, even if it was unintentional. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the circumstances made it difficult, and Eve didn't remind them. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A since agreements are meant to be kept.\n"
