We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a bike agreement between them and their sister Eve. So, first, the context: they share an address, both need to use a single bike, but the sister's campus is only 100 meters away, while the user's is 1.8 km. On Sunday, they agreed that the sister would use the bike for an interview before noon, and the user would walk. The user forgot and used the bike, relying on the sister not reminding them. The sister then got upset, accused them of being selfish and made a sexist comment.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the agreement and the follow-through. The user agreed to walk on Sunday, but they forgot. The sister didn't remind them, which is a red flag. But the user's excuse is that they forgot. The problem is, even if they forgot, the agreement was made. The sister's job interview was important, and she needed the bike. The user didn't check with her again before taking the bike, assuming that since she didn't remind them, the agreement was no longer in effect. But that's not necessarily the case. Just because she didn't follow up doesn't mean the agreement was cancelled. The user should have made an effort to remember or communicated proactively. \n\nThen, when the sister reminded them, the user was already late for their class because they thought using the bike was necessary. The sister was frustrated because the user didn't honor the agreement. The user's response was to say that the sister should have reminded them and that walking wouldn't be a big deal for her. The sister's reaction was emotional, including a sexist comment, which is definitely inappropriate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did make an agreement and forgot about it. The sister didn't remind them, but the user still had the responsibility to honor the agreement. Even if they forgot, the sister's need was specific to Sunday (the job interview), which is a significant event. The user's prior bike issues (lock and flat tire) don't negate the agreement but might add context. However, the user could have considered that the sister's interview was time-sensitive and important. \n\nThe user's argument that walking wouldn't be a big deal for the sister seems dismissive. The sister's campus is just next door, so maybe a 30-minute walk isn't as bad as the user's 2.5 km walk. But the original agreement was about Sunday, not the other days. The user might be conflating the other days' issues with the specific Sunday agreement. \n\nOverall, the main issue is the broken agreement. Even if the sister didn't remind them, the user should have remembered. The user's response to the sister's reminder might have been dismissive or late, leading to the sister's frustration. But the sister's sexist remark was wrong too. So, it's a bit of a situation where both parties have some fault. However, the user did make an agreement and forgot it, leading to a conflict. The user's actions might be seen as the primary issue here. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
