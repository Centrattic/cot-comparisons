We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a bike agreement between siblings. The sister, Eve, asked to use the bike for a job interview, and the author agreed, but then forgot and ended up using the bike for their own class. Now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, did the author make a deal? Yes, they agreed on Sunday that Eve could have the bike before 12:00. But the author forgot, which is the main issue. Eve didn't remind them during the week, but the author still had the responsibility to remember the agreement. Forgetting is a common human thing, but the problem is that the author didn't check in or remember the arrangement, leading to a conflict.\n\nThen, when Eve reminded them, the author had to choose between being late to class or letting go of the bike. The author chose to take the bike, which Eve saw as breaking the agreement. The author argues that Eve should have reminded them, and that walking isn't a big deal for her. But Eve was already dealing with her own interview, which is important. The author had two instances of walking already, but maybe Eve didn't know that. \n\nThe author's response to the sexist comment might have escalated things. The sister's anger is understandable because they trusted the agreement. The author's justification is that they forgot, but they still used the bike despite the prior agreement. Whether it's the author's fault depends on whether forgetting is enough to absolve responsibility. \n\nIn general, agreements are important, even informal ones between family. Forgetting isn't an excuse if you should have remembered. The author could have asked to reschedule or communicated better. The sister's frustration is valid because she was relying on the bike. The author might not be the asshole, but they did break the agreement, so they should apologize for the oversight, even if unintentional.\n"
