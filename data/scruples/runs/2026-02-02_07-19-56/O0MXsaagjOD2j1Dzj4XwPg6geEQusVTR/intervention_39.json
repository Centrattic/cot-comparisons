We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for forgetting and ignoring an agreement with his sister. The situation is about sharing a bike. \n\nFirst, the sister, Eve, asked to use the bike for a job interview on Sunday, and they agreed he would walk. The author forgot and then offered the bike after his class at 12:30, but the interview was at 11:00. He didn't realize the time issue until after agreeing. Then he tried to say she should walk, but she was upset.\n\nSo, the key points: They had an agreement. The author forgot, didn't remind each other, and there was a misunderstanding about timing. The author had a valid reason (he had to be on time for class). Eve made a sexist comment, which is a problem, but the author did break the agreement unintentionally. \n\nBut did he have an obligation to remember? They both had the opportunity to remind each other. The author tried to be reasonable but failed to remember the agreement. Maybe he should have remembered, but life happens. The sister could have reminded him as agreed. The author's response about her walking is a bit harsh, but the main issue is the forgotten agreement. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both share some. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he forgot the agreement, even if unintentionally, and didn't make an effort to accommodate her, maybe he is partly at fault. But Eve overreacted with the sexist comment. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is wrong. But I need to consider if forgetting counts as being in the wrong. If the agreement was clear, then yes, he's responsible. But if the sister didn't remind him, maybe she's also responsible. However, the author had time to walk if he had taken the bike, but he prioritized his class. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because he broke the agreement, even if unintentionally. However, Eve's reaction is also problematic. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he forgot and didn't make good on the agreement, he's at fault. So answer A.\n"
