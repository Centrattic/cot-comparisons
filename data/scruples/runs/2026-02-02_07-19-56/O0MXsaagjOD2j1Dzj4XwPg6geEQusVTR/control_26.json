We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an agreement between the author and their sister, Eve, regarding the shared use of a bike. The author agreed that Eve could use the bike for a job interview, meaning he would walk to his campus. However, he forgot about this agreement and ended up using the bike himself, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they made. On Sunday, they clearly discussed and agreed that Eve would use the bike for her interview before 12:00, so the author would walk. The author confirmed this agreement. The problem arises because he forgot this agreement on the day of the interview and didn't allow Eve to use the bike, leading to her anger.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author is at fault for forgetting and not following through. Forgetting an agreement isn't intentional, but it's still a breach of the agreement. However, Eve didn't remind him during the week, which might contribute to the situation. The author had two prior instances where he had to walk due to bike issues, which could be a factor in his frustration. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he didn't intend to break the agreement and that Eve should have reminded him. He also pointed out that asking Eve to walk for her interview was a fair compromise. On the other hand, Eve was upset about the principle of the agreement not being honored, even though it wasn't intentional. \n\nIt's important to consider whether the author's forgetfulness was his responsibility. Since they live together and share resources, communication is key. Maybe the author should have set a reminder for himself, especially since he's the one relying on the bike daily. Also, Eve's comment about gender might have exacerbated the situation, but the core issue is the broken agreement.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. Eve didn't follow up, and the author forgot. However, the agreement was made, and even if forgotten, the author is responsible for fulfilling it once reminded. The fact that he used the bike despite the agreement, even if he forgot, might make him at fault. But the circumstances (like previous bike issues) could mitigate that. \n\nI think the main question is whether the author should have remembered the agreement. Since he agreed to it and it's a shared living situation, perhaps he's expected to remember, even if he was distracted. The fact that he had to walk twice before might add context, but the agreement was specifically for Eve's interview. Ultimately, not following through on a prior agreement, even if unintentional, could be seen as the author being in the wrong. However, if the sister didn't remind him, that's also a factor. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not solely the sister's fault. So, maybe answer A because he didn't follow through on the agreement, even if he forgot.\n"
