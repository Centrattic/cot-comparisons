We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forgetting an agreement with their sister. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister (Eve) and the author live together, study on different campuses. The bike is shared, and the author uses it daily because their campus is further away. Last Sunday, Eve asked to use the bike for a job interview before 12, and the author agreed to walk. Eve didn't remind them during the week.\n\nNow, the incident. The author forgot the agreement, told Eve they'd use the bike until 12:30. Eve reminded them about the 11 AM interview. The author then had to walk, which would make them late for class. They explained the problem, suggested Eve walk instead, and she got angry, calling the author sexist and selfish.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author forget an agreement and then prioritize their own needs over the sister's? The author had a prior agreement but forgot. Eve didn't remind them, but the author still agreed to the initial plan. Forgetting the agreement is their fault. They didn't follow through, leading to Eve's frustration. The author then offered a solution that might not be fair (making Eve walk), which Eve took as selfish. \n\nThe author's defense is that they had a bad week with bike issues, but that doesn't excuse forgetting the agreement. The fact that they didn't keep the agreement and then tried to shift the problem to Eve by suggesting she walk might show they're not taking responsibility. The sister's anger is about the principle of broken promises. The author's response with the sexist comment might have escalated things, but the initial issue is their forgetfulness and not honoring the agreement. \n\nSo, even if the author had a valid reason for being late, they still broke the agreement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not keeping their word, regardless of the circumstances. They should have remembered the agreement and maybe found a solution that respects both parties, like getting up earlier. The sister's overreaction might have been part of the conflict, but the author's forgetfulness and failure to follow through is the main issue here.\n"
