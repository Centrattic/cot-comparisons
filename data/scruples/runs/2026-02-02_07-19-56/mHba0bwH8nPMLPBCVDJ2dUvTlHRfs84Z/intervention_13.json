I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a salesman coming to the door, and the author feeling \"creepy vibes\" and reacting by not letting him in.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The man arrives at the door, claims to be a tree surgeon about a tree that's in the neighbor's garden. The author tells him to talk to the neighbor. Then he asks about the dog and the baby, and the author feels uncomfortable, especially when the man asks about the dog's protectiveness and looks at her chest. The author then lies about the dog and half-closes the door to block him, leading the man to leave.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel like they might be judging based on gender (since they wouldn't react the same to a woman) but also have a sense of caution. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The man's behavior: asking personal questions after the initial purpose of the visit is unclear. The author's safety concerns. The man's non-descript van without company info, which could be a red flag. The author's actions to protect themselves and their baby, even if based on intuition.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people are generally encouraged to trust their instincts when it comes to personal safety, especially when vulnerable, like being home alone with a baby. The man's persistence after being told to talk to the neighbor, asking invasive questions, and possible inappropriate behavior (looking at her chest) could justify the author's suspicion. \n\nThe author isn't physically attacking or threatening the man; they're just closing the door. It's a defensive measure. While there's a possibility the man was just trying to make business, the situation allows for the author's caution. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're on maternity leave with a baby and a dog. They might be more alert to potential threats. The man's lack of company information on the van is suspicious. \n\nIn many AITA discussions, the consensus tends to support trusting one's instincts in safety matters. Even if the man was innocent, the author's actions were a reasonable response to perceived danger. So the answer here is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key is that personal safety is a valid concern, and the author's reaction is justified given the circumstances.\n"
