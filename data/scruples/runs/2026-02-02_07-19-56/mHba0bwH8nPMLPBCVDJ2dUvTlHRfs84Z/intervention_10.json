I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a \"creepy vibe.\" The situation involves a door-to-door interaction where the salesman comes to talk about a tree, then shifts to asking personal questions about the baby and dog, and the author feels uncomfortable, especially when the man looks at their chest. The author closes the door and later feels guilty for possibly misjudging him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were at home alone with a baby and a dog, on maternity leave. When someone shows up unexpectedly, especially a male stranger, it's natural to be cautious. The salesman's behavior\u2014asking personal questions after being informed it's not his tree, looking into the house, and focusing on the baby and then the author's chest\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The author's reaction of closing the door and lying about the dog's behavior seems like a reasonable precaution, especially in a situation where they felt unsafe.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acknowledges they might be profiling and questions if they're being a \"dickhead.\" The key here is whether the author's judgment was based on legitimate safety concerns or gender bias. The salesman's actions, like the way he asked questions and looked at the chest, could be interpreted as creepy regardless of his gender. The fact that the van is non-descript without a company name adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking validation. I need to weigh the author's right to feel unsafe and protect their home against the possibility of mistaken judgment. The author's actions were defensive and not aggressive. They didn't accuse the man of anything but used a white lie to deter him. The main issue is the man's behavior: if he was genuinely trying to drum up business, his approach was unprofessional and intrusive. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for trusting their instincts and prioritizing their safety and their baby's. The man's actions provided ample reason for suspicion, and the author's response was a reasonable self-protective measure.\n"
