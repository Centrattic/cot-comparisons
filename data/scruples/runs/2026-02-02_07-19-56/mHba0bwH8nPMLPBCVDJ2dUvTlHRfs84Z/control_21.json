I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a salesman who came to the door, which the person answered while on maternity leave with a baby and a dog. The salesman started asking personal questions about the baby and the dog, and the author felt creeped out, leading them to be defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author felt uncomfortable and sensed something was off. The salesman approached with a legitimate reason (dead tree in the neighbor's garden) but then asked personal questions and looked at the author's chest. The author then lied about the dog to deter him further. \n\nOn the one hand, the author might be judged for profiling the man based on his gender, as they mentioned they wouldn't have reacted the same if it were a woman. But on the other hand, the man's behavior was suspicious: he lingered after being informed the tree wasn't theirs, asked intrusive questions, looked at inappropriate areas, and waited in a van without company branding. \n\nThe key points here are the man's actions that could be seen as suspicious. The author's actions were protective, especially considering the presence of a baby. Trusting one's instincts in such situations is often advised for safety. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling unsafe and taking precautions. \n\nAlso, societal expectations might play a role. Women are often told to be cautious and trust their instincts when they feel threatened. The author's reaction is a self-defense mechanism. The fact that the man left after the author's deterrent suggests he might have had ill intentions. \n\nHowever, there's a possibility the author misjudged the man. But given the suspicious behavior, it's reasonable to take a cautious approach. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
