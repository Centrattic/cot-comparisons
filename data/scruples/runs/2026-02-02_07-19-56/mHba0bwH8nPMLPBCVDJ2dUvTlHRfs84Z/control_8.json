I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a salesman (tree surgeon) knocked on her door, she answered, and he asked some questions that made her feel creeped out. She felt he was being intrusive and maybe had bad intentions, so she closed the door. She's wondering if she was being judgmental or if she was right to be cautious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The woman is on maternity leave, alone with her baby and a dog. The man is in a work uniform, but his van isn't marked with a company name. He comes to her door about a tree she doesn't own. When she tries to close the door, he asks personal questions about her baby and the dog. She mentions he looked at her chest and seemed interested in whether the dog would protect her. She then lies about the dog and closes the door more tightly. \n\nNow, the key points here: She felt unsafe, which is a valid concern. She was alone with a baby, which can make someone more cautious. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions after she tried to close the door and looking at her chest\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The van being non-descript might also raise red flags because legitimate businesses usually have their name and contact info on their vehicles. \n\nOn the other hand, she acknowledges that she might be profiling if it were a woman instead of a man. But given the circumstances, her intuition is triggered by the man's behavior. Legally, she had the right to refuse entry and ask him to leave. She didn't confront him physically or make accusations beyond setting boundaries.\n\nSo, the question is whether her reaction was justified. Generally, trusting one's instincts about someone's intent is considered reasonable, especially when safety is a concern. She didn't act aggressively; she just closed the door. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
