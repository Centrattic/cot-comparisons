I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for judging a salesman who gave them a creepy vibe. The situation is that the author, on maternity leave with their baby, answered the door and a man in a uniform showed up to discuss a tree in the neighbor's yard. When the author tried to close the door, he asked about the dog and the baby, and then looked at their chest. The author lied about the dog being protective and then half-closed the door as a precaution. They're wondering if they overreacted or if the salesman's behavior was actually suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a new parent, which can make them more cautious, especially when alone with a baby. The salesman's actions\u2014lingering after the request for the neighbor, asking personal questions, looking at the chest\u2014could be seen as red flags. People often have a sense of when someone is making them uncomfortable, even if they can't articulate it. The fact that the van was non-descript with no company info might add to the suspicion. \n\nBut the author is questioning if they're profiling because they wouldn't have reacted that way to a woman. That's an interesting point. It's possible they're reacting to the man's behavior, which could be considered creepy regardless of gender, but they're self-aware about potential gender bias. However, the key here is the behavior itself. If the man was acting inappropriately, then the author's reaction is justified. \n\nIn many cases, people who approach strangers at their door can have malicious intent. The man didn't take the hint when the author tried to close the door, which is a common sign to stop the conversation. Asking about the baby's age and future children, while looking into the house, might be part of a tactic to assess vulnerabilities. The author's decision to lie and close the door is a precautionary measure, which is reasonable for safety. \n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that the author is assuming the worst without evidence. The man could have been trying to make conversation to build rapport as part of his job. But the combination of his persistent questions, the physical look at the chest, and the unmarked van are all factors that could contribute to a creepy vibe. \n\nI think the author's intuition served them well here. Trusting one's gut in safety matters is important, especially with a child at home. While it's good to avoid stereotypes, if the behavior is genuinely suspicious, it's not profiling. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong, because they were protecting their home and child based on the man's actions that made them uncomfortable.\n"
