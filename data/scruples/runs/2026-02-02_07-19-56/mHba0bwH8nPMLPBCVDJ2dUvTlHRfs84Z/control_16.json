I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a man coming to the door, supposedly about a tree, but then asking personal questions and making the author uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the man approached the door. The author was alone with a baby and a dog. After explaining that the tree isn't hers, she tries to close the door, but he asks more questions, including about her baby and dog's protectiveness. He also looked at her chest, which she found creepy. She lied about the dog to deter him, and he left.\n\nThe author is questioning if her suspicion was justified or if she's being sexist. The key points here are the man's behavior: continuing to engage after the reason for his visit was dismissed, asking personal questions, staring at her chest, and lingering in a van without company info. These actions could be signs of intent beyond just business. \n\nThe author's precautions (lying about the dog, half-closing the door) are safety measures, which are reasonable given the situation. People have the right to feel unsafe and take steps to protect themselves, especially when there's a risk. The fact that she was on maternity leave, alone with a baby, adds to the legitimate concern.\n\nJudging based on gender is a valid concern, but the man's actions themselves (personal questions, staring, lingering) provide specific reasons for suspicion. It's not just about being a man but his behavior that's problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being cautious. Her instincts were right to be suspicious given the context and the man's actions. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
