I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman knocking on their door, claiming to be a tree surgeon, and then asking personal questions that made the author feel uncomfortable. The author then decides to close the door and even lies about the dog's behavior to deter the man.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author is a woman on maternity leave, with a baby and a dog. The man at the door is in a worker uniform but his van isn't marked with a company name. He asks about the tree, then shifts to personal questions about the baby and the dog, which makes the author feel \"creepy vibes.\" The author feels conflicted because they might be judging based on gender but also has concerns about safety.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's primary concern is safety. They mention that the man kept looking at their chest and asked questions that seemed intrusive. The van being non-descript adds to the suspicion. The author's actions\u2014half-closing the door, lying about the dog\u2014are defensive measures to protect themselves and their baby.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can't be \"in the wrong\" for being cautious about your safety, especially when there's a potential threat. The author's reaction is a self-defense mechanism. The man's behavior\u2014uninvited personal questions, lingering looks, and the van without a company name\u2014could reasonably raise suspicions. The fact that the man didn't take the hint when the author tried to close the door suggests he wasn't respecting her boundaries, which is a red flag.\n\nThere's also the aspect of gender bias the author mentions. They feel guilty for reacting differently to a man compared to a woman. However, it's common for people to be more cautious with male strangers, especially when they're alone with a baby. While gender profiling isn't ideal, the author's primary concern was safety, not just gender. The key is that the man's actions, not his gender, prompted the response.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for taking precautions. Their judgment was based on the man's behavior and circumstances, not just his gender. They had a right to feel unsafe and act accordingly. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
