I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for judging a salesman with a 'creepy vibe'. \n\nFirst, the context: A woman on maternity leave answers a door expecting a book delivery. A man in a work uniform says he's there about a tree that's not in her property. She tells him to talk to the neighbor. When she tries to close the door, he starts asking personal questions about her baby, then about the dog, and looks at her chest. She feels uneasy, lies about the dog, and slams the door. She's doubting herself because she might be gender profiling, but also feels her instincts were correct.\n\nNow, the key points. The man's behavior: after being told he's at the wrong place, he continues to engage by asking personal questions. Then, looking at her chest and asking about the dog's protectiveness. These are red flags. The woman felt unsafe, which is a valid reason to end the interaction. \n\nShe's questioning if she's being sexist by reacting differently to a man than a woman would. But even if that's a consideration, her safety is the priority. The fact that he lingered after she tried to close the door and had a non-descript van with no company info adds to the suspicion. \n\nThe user wants to know if she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her reaction is justified. Since she felt threatened and took steps to protect herself and her child, it's reasonable. The man's actions were inappropriate, so she's not in the wrong for being cautious. The answer should be B (No).\n"
