I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong for judging the salesman. \n\nFirst, the scenario: a woman on maternity leave answers the door to a man who works for a tree company, but she feels he's acting creepily. He asks personal questions about her baby and dog, and she gets suspicious, especially since his van doesn't have a company name. She closes the door, and he drives off.\n\nThe author is conflicted. She wonders if she's being sexist by judging him just because he's a man, but also feels her instincts were right. The main question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the key points: The man approached without being expected, asked personal questions after the initial business was done, looked at her chest, and stayed in a van without company info. The woman felt unsafe, which is valid. Society often tells women to be cautious about strangers, especially when vulnerable (like with a baby). Her reaction\u2014using the dog as an excuse and closing the door\u2014is a common safety measure. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he was just trying to be friendly, but his behavior could be seen as overstepping. The fact that he lingered in the van might indicate he wasn't there for work. The author's suspicion might be justified. \n\nIn terms of judgment, she's not wrong for trusting her instincts. People can misinterpret actions, but her safety and her baby's safety are priorities. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because her caution is reasonable given the situation.\n"
