I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a man knocking on the door while the woman is home with her baby and dog. The man is a tree surgeon but starts asking personal questions and seems to look at her chest. The woman then gets a creepy vibe and closes the door, feeling suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man approached to talk about a tree not in her property, which means he might have been trespassing or not. Then he started asking personal questions about the baby and the dog, and his gaze towards her chest is a red flag. The woman felt unsafe and took precautions, which seems reasonable. She also mentions feeling like she's judging him because he's a man, which adds a layer about gender bias.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The main factors here are safety and judgment. The woman was at home with a baby, which is a vulnerable situation. The man's behavior\u2014asking intrusive questions and lingering\u2014could be concerning. Even if he was just trying to do business, his actions might have been inappropriate. The woman's reaction is about protecting her family, which is a valid instinct. However, there's a consideration of whether she overreacted or made assumptions based on his gender. But given the context of potential threats and her own intuition, her response might be justified. So, is she wrong for trusting her gut? Probably not. The answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
