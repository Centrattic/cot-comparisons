I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who felt a salesman had a \"creepy vibe\" and took precautions. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman was on maternity leave, alone with her baby and a dog. A man in a work uniform came to her door about a tree. She explained it wasn't her property, and he then started asking personal questions about her baby, maybe looking at her chest. She felt uncomfortable and closed the door.\n\nThe key points here are her safety and intuition. She's a new mom, vulnerable, and had a baby at home. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions, looking into the house, looking at her chest\u2014could be seen as suspicious. Even if he was just trying to make business, her response was to protect herself and her child.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for judging him. Well, personal safety is a big deal. People can trust their instincts, especially in situations where they feel threatened. She didn't confront him aggressively; she just closed the door and maybe gave him a hint to leave. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of him being in a van without a company name. That's a red flag for some people. Even if he was legitimate, her reaction is understandable. It's about feeling safe. She's not profiling just because he's a guy; the specific actions and context matter.\n\nSo, considering her situation and the potential risks, her actions seem reasonable. She wasn't being a dickhead but protecting herself. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
