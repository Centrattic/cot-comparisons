I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a \"creepy vibe\" they got during a door-to-door encounter. The situation is that the salesman came to the door, mentioned a dead tree, and when the woman (on maternity leave) explained it's the neighbor's tree, he lingered, asked personal questions about her baby and dog, and looked at her chest. She felt uncomfortable, lied about the dog, and closed the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. She's a new mother, which can make someone more cautious. The salesman didn't have a company logo on his van, which is suspicious. He asked inappropriate questions after she said he should talk to the neighbor. The looking at her chest is a clear issue. Personal space and safety are important, especially when alone with a baby and a dog. Her actions were defensive, trying to secure the door if he tried to enter. \n\nFrom the other side, the salesman might have been trying to do his job, but the way he approached was off. If he was genuinely trying to help with the tree, he should have respected her boundaries once she said it's the neighbor's. The questions about the baby and the dog's protectiveness, along with the gaze, are red flags. \n\nThe question is whether her judgment was wrong. She didn't profile based on gender; the user mentions she wouldn't have reacted the same if it was a woman. That shows she's not generalizing based on sex. She acted on specific behaviors that made her uncomfortable. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong, because she had valid reasons to feel threatened and took precautions. Society encourages being cautious with strangers, and the salesman's actions were indeed creepy. The user's internal conflict about being a \"dick head\" is probably due to social stigma around judging people, but in this case, self-defense and safety are justified.\n"
