I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman who gave them a \"creepy vibe.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is on maternity leave, answering the door to a man claiming to be a tree surgeon. He asks about the tree, then shifts to asking about the baby and the dog, and looks at her chest. The author feels creeped out, lies about the dog, and half-closes the door. The guy leaves.\n\nNow, the user is torn between thinking they're judging based on gender versus their instincts. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Safety is a big factor here. The man was at their home, asking personal questions, making inappropriate eye contact. The author felt threatened, so taking precautions makes sense. Even if the man was innocent, the author's reaction is about self-protection. Society often tells people, especially women, not to trust their instincts, but in reality, trusting them can prevent harm.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the man was just trying to make conversation. But given the context\u2014unannounced visit, personal questions, looking at chest\u2014it's reasonable to feel unsafe. The author isn't just profiling based on gender; there are specific behaviors that raised red flags. Also, the man was in a non-descript van with no company info, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to perceived threats, and they prioritized their safety and their baby's. I don't think they're in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
