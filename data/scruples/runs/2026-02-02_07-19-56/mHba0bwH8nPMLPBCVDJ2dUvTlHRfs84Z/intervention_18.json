I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman who came to the door claiming to be a tree surgeon, but the author felt uncomfortable and judged him as creepy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman was on maternity leave, alone with her baby and a dog. A man in a uniform came to her door about a tree that's actually in her neighbor's yard. He asked about the dog's protectiveness and looked into her chest. She felt uncomfortable and closed the door, later questioning her judgment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether her reaction was justified. On one hand, she's a new mother, possibly more vulnerable, and her instincts told her something was off. The man didn't have proper identification, asked intrusive questions, and made her feel unsafe. Her actions were defensive, closing the door and lying to get him to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, she's questioning if she's profiling because he was a man. But the key factors here aren't his gender but his behavior. The man's actions\u2014asking about the dog's protectiveness, lingering after being told to leave, looking at her chest\u2014could be signs of something more sinister. Also, the van had no company info, which raises red flags. \n\nIn similar situations, people are often advised to trust their instincts, especially when safety is a concern. The woman's decision to secure the door and not let him in seems reasonable given the circumstances. There's no indication she acted aggressively or without cause. So, while she's self-reflecting on her potential bias, the situation presented enough red flags that her caution was justified. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
