I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman (tree surgeon) coming to the door, and the author feeling creeped out, leading to closing the door and being suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The person was on maternity leave, had a baby and a dog. The salesman came to address a tree that wasn't on their property. The author initially thought it was about their book order, then realized it was the neighbor's tree. The salesman then asked personal questions about the baby and the dog, looked at the author's chest, and the author felt creeped out. They lied about the dog's behavior and closed the door. The author is conflicted between possible gender bias and their instincts.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for judging the salesman. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the key points here. The salesman was in a worker uniform, but the van had no company info. He approached the wrong property. He asked personal questions after being told it wasn't his responsibility. He looked at the author's chest, which is a red flag. The author's reaction was to close the door and be cautious. \n\nTrust your instincts is a common advice, especially when safety is concerned. The author was alone with a baby and a dog. The salesman's behavior crosses boundaries by asking inappropriate questions and staring. The author's caution is understandable. \n\nBut there's a mention of possible gender bias, as the author notes they wouldn't react the same to a woman. However, the situation itself includes actions (looking at chest, intrusive questions) that are concerning regardless of gender. So the author's reaction is based on the man's actions, not just his gender. \n\nAlso, the van being non-descript without company info raises suspicion. The salesman might have been preying on a vulnerable situation\u2014someone alone with a baby. \n\nIn terms of legal or moral wrong, the author isn't doing anything illegal by closing the door. They were protecting their home and child. The salesman's actions are the issue here. \n\nTherefore, the author's judgment is based on the man's behavior, not just his gender. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the author acted on legitimate concerns for their safety and that of their child.\n"
