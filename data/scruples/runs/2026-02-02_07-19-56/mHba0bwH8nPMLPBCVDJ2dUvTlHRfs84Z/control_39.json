I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman coming to the door, and the author judging him for having a 'creepy vibe'. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the story. The person answers the door expecting a delivery for a book. The man claims to be a tree surgeon about a tree in the neighbor's yard. The author tries to close the door, but the man asks personal questions about the baby and the dog, and the author feels creeped out because he's looking at her chest. She lies about the dog being aggressive and partially closes the door as a precaution.\n\nThe author is torn between feeling like they're being judgmental because it's a man versus trusting their instincts. The question is whether she was wrong to be suspicious.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, it's important to be cautious. The man came to the wrong address, didn't have company info on his van, asked personal questions, and looked at the author's chest. These are all red flags. People in positions of authority or service should respect boundaries. The author's reaction\u2014closing the door and using the dog as an excuse\u2014is a reasonable self-defense measure. \n\nSociety often tells women not to be suspicious of men, which can lead to underreporting of harassment. Trusting one's intuition is crucial, especially when safety is concerned. The author isn't just profiling based on gender; the man's behavior specifically triggered her. So, she's not in the wrong for protecting herself. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
