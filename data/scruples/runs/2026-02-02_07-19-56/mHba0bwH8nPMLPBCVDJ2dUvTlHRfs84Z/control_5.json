I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman coming to the door, and the author feeling creeped out and closing the door. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The woman is on maternity leave, alone with her baby and a dog. A man in a worker uniform comes to her door, claims to be a tree surgeon about a tree she doesn't own. She tells him to talk to the neighbor. As she's closing the door, he asks about her baby, then about the dog's behavior. She feels he's looking at her chest and asking invasive questions. She lies about the dog and half-closes the door to block him. The man drives off.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted. On one hand, she feels she's judging him for being a man, as she wouldn't react the same to a woman. On the other hand, she trusts her instincts from watching true crime shows.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong for judging him based on her feelings. \n\nPossible angles to consider:\n\n1. **Safety and Intuition**: The woman's intuition is a key factor here. She's alone with a baby. If she felt unsafe, her reaction could be justified. Trusting one's gut in potentially dangerous situations is often advised.\n\n2. **Gender Bias**: She acknowledges she might be profiling a man. Is it wrong to be cautious based on gender if there's no evidence against him? However, in a society where men are statistically more likely to commit violent crimes, her caution could be seen as a natural response, not necessarily profiling.\n\n3. **Behavior of the Salesman**: The man's actions\u2014asking questions after being told to leave, staring at her chest, and lingering after being dismissed\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. If he was genuinely a tree surgeon, he might have left immediately. The van without a company name adds suspicion.\n\n4. **Misinterpretation**: Could the man have had innocent intentions? Maybe he was genuinely concerned about the tree and the baby's safety. But his persistence and the way he asked personal questions might have crossed a line.\n\n5. **Social Norms**: It's common to be wary of strangers at the door, especially when vulnerable. Closing the door for safety isn't unreasonable. The fact that she had a baby and a dog suggests she's in a situation where safety is paramount.\n\n6. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: The man wasn't aggressive, just persistent. However, if he was trespassing or harassing, she has the right to protect her property and family. There's no indication she was rude; she just closed the door.\n\n7. **Context of Maternity Leave**: Being on maternity leave might heighten her senses about the safety of her child. The presence of a dog as a protective measure is also a factor.\n\nConsidering all these points, the woman's actions seem justified. She felt threatened and took reasonable steps to protect herself and her baby. While she acknowledges the possibility of bias, her primary concern was safety. The man's behavior included questionable actions that could reasonably raise suspicion. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (Answer B).\n"
