I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a person answering the door during maternity leave, encountering a man who claims to be a tree surgeon. The man asks personal questions about the baby and the dog, and the author feels a \"creepy vibe,\" leading to closing the door and being defensive. The author is conflicted between possibly judging the man unfairly because he's a man versus trusting their instincts.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both angles. The author's actions: they answered the door, the man's behavior included looking into the house, asking personal questions, and staring at their chest. The author felt uncomfortable and took defensive measures. The key points here are the man's suspicious behavior and the author's response.\n\nOn one hand, the man approached under a pretense (tree surgeon) but then acted in a way that could be considered intrusive. The questions about the baby and the dog might be trying to gauge the safety of the home. The fact that the man didn't have a company name on his van adds to the suspicion. The author's instinct to be cautious is understandable, especially as a parent concerned for their child's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is questioning if they are biased against a male salesperson. However, the man's actions themselves\u2014looking into the house, personal questions, staring\u2014could be red flags. The author didn't confront the man but instead set boundaries by closing the door. The man left after, which might indicate he was just trying to get in, and the author's caution prevented that.\n\nThe main consideration is whether the author's reaction was reasonable. In such situations, trusting one's instincts is often advised, especially when safety is a concern. The author's actions don't seem overly hostile but rather cautious. There's no evidence that the man was actually a legitimate tree surgeon, so the author's suspicion is based on observable behaviors rather than gender alone. The fact that the author is a parent might heighten their sense of protectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being cautious. Their response was based on the man's behavior, not just his gender, even though they acknowledge a possible bias. The key is that they took steps to ensure their safety without escalating the situation. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
