I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a creepy vibe. The situation involves a man coming to the door, talking about a tree, then asking personal questions and looking at the author's chest. The author felt unsafe, lied to the man, and closed the door. They're conflicted because they might be judging based on gender but also felt their instincts were right.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the man's behavior: he was at the wrong property, asked intrusive questions about the baby and the dog, made the author feel uncomfortable with his gaze, and lingered. The author's response was to set boundaries and not let him in. \n\nIn terms of personal safety, trusting one's instincts is often advised, especially when someone makes you feel uneasy. The man's behavior\u2014asking about the dog's protectiveness and looking at the chest\u2014could be interpreted as suspicious. The author's decision to protect their home and family seems reasonable given those signs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author does acknowledge the possibility of gender bias, since they wouldn't have reacted the same way to a woman. However, the situation's specifics (the man being in a non-descript van, lack of company info, and the questions asked) contribute to the suspicious vibe. It's a balance between being cautious and not making assumptions based on gender.\n\nLegal and safety guidelines often encourage people to prioritize their safety and trust their instincts. The author didn't escalate the situation but took defensive measures without confrontation. There's no indication of false accusations or unnecessary hostility, just a defensive action based on perceived threats.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their response was justified given the circumstances and the need to ensure their family's safety. Answer B.\n"
