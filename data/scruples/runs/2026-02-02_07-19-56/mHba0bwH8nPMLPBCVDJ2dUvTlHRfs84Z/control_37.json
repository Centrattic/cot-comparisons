I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for judging a salesman for having a \"creepy vibe.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: A woman on maternity leave answers the door for a salesman who claims to be a tree surgeon. The man keeps asking intrusive questions about her baby and dog, looks at her chest, and she feels uncomfortable. She lies about the dog to deter him, which works. She's conflicted because she might be judging him just for being male, but her instincts told her something was off.\n\nSo, the key points here. The man approached her while she was alone with a baby and a dog. He asked personal questions, which can be a red flag. The fact that he looked at her chest adds to the creepiness. She took precautions, which is understandable. The van had no company info, making it suspicious. Her reaction is based on self-defense and intuition. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and safety, it's generally advised to be cautious with strangers. The man's behavior\u2014asking about the dog's protectiveness, staring inappropriately, and lingering after being told the tree isn't hers\u2014raises concerns. The AITA's hesitation stems from possible gender bias, but her safety is valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because she acted on legitimate safety concerns. Judging someone for being creepy when they display suspicious behavior is reasonable, especially in a vulnerable situation like being alone with a baby.\n"
