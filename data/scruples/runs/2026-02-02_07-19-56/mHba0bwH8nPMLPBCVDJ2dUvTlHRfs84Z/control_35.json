I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a \"creepy vibe.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is on maternity leave, alone with her baby and a dog. A man comes to the door claiming to be a tree surgeon about a tree that's not in her property. She tells him to talk to the neighbor. When she tries to close the door, he asks about the dog and then about her baby. He seems to look at her chest and asks personal questions. She feels uncomfortable, lies about the dog, and closes the door partially. He leaves after a while.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted: she's worried about judging someone just because he's a man, but she also felt a creepiness. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a woman alone at home with a baby. The man is a stranger in a non-descript van with no company info. His behavior\u2014asking personal questions, staring at her chest, and lingering after being told to talk to the neighbor\u2014could be seen as suspicious. Her reaction is to be cautious, which is a common self-defense mechanism, especially for women alone. \n\nSociety often tells women to be cautious about strangers, especially in situations where they're vulnerable. The man's actions, like asking about the dog's protectiveness and looking into the house, might be interpreted as trying to assess if he can gain entry. The author's decision to close the door and not let him in seems like a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the man might be innocent, trying to make business, but the combination of his behavior and the situation (stranger at the door, no company info) raises red flags. The author isn't just judging based on gender but on specific actions that she found unsettling. \n\nSo, is she wrong? Probably not. Trusting her instincts in a potentially dangerous situation is a valid choice. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her reaction is based on legitimate concerns for her safety and her baby's, and she's taking precautions which is prudent.\n"
