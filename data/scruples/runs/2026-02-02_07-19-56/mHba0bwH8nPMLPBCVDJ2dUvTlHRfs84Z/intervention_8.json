I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman coming to the door, and the author (who's on maternity leave) feels creeped out by his behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the key points. The man claims to be a tree surgeon, but the tree is in the neighbor's yard. He asks personal questions about the baby and the dog, and the author notices he keeps looking at her chest. She lies about the dog being aggressive to deter him, and he leaves. The author is conflicted because she's worried she's judging based on gender, but her intuition told her something was off.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author is alone with a baby and a dog. The man's behavior is questionable: he's in a non-descript van, no company info, he's asking inappropriate questions, and his gaze is unsettling. The author's actions were to protect herself and her child. \n\nIs she being sexist? The author acknowledges she might have reacted differently if it were a woman, but the situation's specifics (creepy behavior, suspicious van, inappropriate questions) are what triggered her suspicion, not just the man's gender. So her judgment is based on his actions, not just his being a man. \n\nAlso, in such situations, personal safety is a priority. Even if the man was a legitimate tree surgeon with bad people skills, the author had the right to be cautious. The key is whether her reaction was reasonable given the red flags he presented. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because she's not in the wrong. Her intuition and safety measures were justified based on his behavior.\n"
