I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman coming to the door, and the author feels he gave off a \"creepy vibe.\" I need to determine if the author's judgment was justified.\n\nFirst, the man arrived unannounced, claiming to be a tree surgeon. The author correctly points out the tree isn't theirs and tells him to talk to the neighbor. Then, instead of leaving, he starts asking personal questions about the baby and the dog. The author notices he's looking at their chest, which makes them uncomfortable. They lie about the dog to deter him and half-close the door. The man leaves but sits in his van for a while.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they might be judging based on gender, as they note they wouldn't react the same way to a woman. However, their instincts told them something was off. The key points here are the man's persistence after being told to leave, the personal questions, the inappropriate gaze, and the van without company info. These are red flags. The author's actions were defensive and reasonable given the situation. They didn't confront him aggressively but took steps to ensure their safety. The fact that the man lingered in the van also supports the author's suspicion. The author isn't wrong for trusting their intuition here. So, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
