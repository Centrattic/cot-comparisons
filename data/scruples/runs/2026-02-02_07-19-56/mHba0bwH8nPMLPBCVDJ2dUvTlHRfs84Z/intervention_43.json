I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman who came to the door, and the author felt creeped out and judged him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is on maternity leave, has a baby and a dog. A man arrives in a work uniform, says he's a tree surgeon, mentions the neighbor's tree. The author is about to close the door, but he asks about the dog and the baby. Then he looks at her chest and asks questions that make her feel unsafe. She lies about the dog and tries to shut the door. The man leaves. The author is conflicted because she feels she might be judging him just for being a man, but also feels her instincts were right.\n\nThe key points here are: the man was in a uniform, came to check a tree. The author's suspicion is based on his behavior\u2014asking intrusive questions, looking at her chest, and the lack of company info on his van. She's concerned about being sexist but also about safety.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion. I need to decide if the author was wrong to be suspicious. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, trusting one's instincts is often advised. People are supposed to be cautious about strangers at the door, especially when vulnerable (like with a baby). The man's behavior\u2014staying after the initial purpose was addressed, asking personal questions, looking at her chest\u2014could be concerning. The van being non-descript without company info adds to the suspicion. \n\nHowever, the author might be gender-biased if she would react differently to a woman. But the specific actions described (like looking at the chest) are actions that would be considered inappropriate regardless of gender, though societal norms might make it more common for men to get away with such behavior.\n\nThe author's actions were defensive\u2014half-closing the door to prevent being forced in. That's a reasonable safety measure. She didn't confront him aggressively but tried to close the door, which is a standard way to handle unwelcome visitors.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral wrong, the author isn't committing a crime by being cautious. The man's actions might be the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for trusting her gut, especially given the potential risks. The alternative is to be naive and potentially put herself and her baby in danger.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). She's taking precautions based on his suspicious behavior, which is understandable and responsible.\n"
