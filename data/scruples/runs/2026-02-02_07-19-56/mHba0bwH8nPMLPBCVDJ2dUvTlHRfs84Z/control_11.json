I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who feels a salesman gave her a \"creepy vibe\" and she ended up being cautious with him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. She's on maternity leave, a man comes to her door claiming to be a tree surgeon about a tree in the neighbor's yard. She tells him to talk to the neighbor. He then starts asking personal questions about her baby and the dog, and she feels he's looking at her chest. She lies about the dog being protective and closes the door, which he leaves. She's conflicted because she realizes she might be judging him just for being male, but her instincts are making her suspicious.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to think about self-defense and safety. In many cultures, women are often advised to be cautious about strangers, especially when alone and vulnerable, like with a baby. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions after being told to talk to the neighbor, looking into the house, focusing on her chest\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nShe didn't let him in, just closed the door. Her actions were defensive. Even if he was just a salesman, her feeling unsafe and taking precautions isn't necessarily wrong. People can have different reactions based on their instincts and experiences. She mentioned she watches forensic shows, which might heighten her awareness. \n\nOn the other hand, she's questioning if she's profiling. But even if she might be overreacting, her safety is a priority. It's not wrong to protect oneself. The man's behavior, regardless of his actual intent, crossed boundaries by being overly personal and making her uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She had a right to feel unsafe and take steps to ensure her safety and her baby's.\n"
