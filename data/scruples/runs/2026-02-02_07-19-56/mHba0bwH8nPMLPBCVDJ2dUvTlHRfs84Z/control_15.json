I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on his \"creepy vibe.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a woman on maternity leave, answers the door to a man in a uniform claiming to be a tree surgeon. He mentions a tree not in her property. She tries to close the door, but he asks about her baby, then the dog. She feels he's asking about the dog's protectiveness and looks at her chest, leading her to shut the door and lie about the dog. The man leaves.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the salesman's behavior. The author felt unsafe and judged the man for his behavior, which she found suspicious. She's torn between feeling she's profiling the man as a man versus her instincts. The question is whether her reaction is justified.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Trusting one's instincts is important for personal safety. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions after the initial purpose for being there, looking into the house, focusing on her chest\u2014could be seen as intrusive. The author's actions (lying about the dog, closing the door) were defensive measures to ensure her safety. \n\nThe salesman's actions might not be illegal, but they can be perceived as inappropriate or unsettling. The author is not obligated to tolerate behavior that makes her uncomfortable, especially when she's vulnerable (e.g., alone with a baby and a dog). \n\nJudging someone based on gender isn't justified if the behavior itself is questionable. The author's reaction is based on the man's actions, not just his gender. So, she's not in the wrong for protecting herself. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
