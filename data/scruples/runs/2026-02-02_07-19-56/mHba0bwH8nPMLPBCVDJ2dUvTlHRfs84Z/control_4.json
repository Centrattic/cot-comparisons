I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for judging a salesman based on \"creepy vibes.\" The scenario involves a man coming to the door, talking about a tree, then asking personal questions and looking at the baby and the woman's chest. The woman feels uncomfortable, lies about the dog, and closes the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The salesman's behavior: he approaches without permission, asks personal questions after being told it's not his property, and looks at the woman's chest. These actions could be seen as inappropriate or invasive. The woman's response: she feels unsafe, uses the dog as a deterrent, and closes the door. She's on maternity leave, which might make her more cautious.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The possible angles are: she's overreacting due to sexism (assuming the worst because he's a man) or she's acting on legitimate safety concerns. The question is about judgment\u2014whether her suspicion is justified or not.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people are generally advised to trust their instincts when they feel unsafe. The man's behavior crosses boundaries by asking personal questions and staring inappropriately. Even if he was just trying to do business, his actions were intrusive. The woman's response is a self-defense measure. She's not just judging based on gender but on specific behaviors that made her uncomfortable. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because her reaction is based on his actions and her right to feel safe.\n"
