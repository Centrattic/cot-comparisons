I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a salesman coming to their house, and the author felt a \"creepy vibe\" leading them to be cautious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a woman on maternity leave, alone with her baby and a dog. She answers the door expecting a book delivery but instead meets a man claiming to be a tree surgeon. He asks personal questions about her baby and the dog, and she feels uncomfortable, especially when he looks at her chest. She then lies about the dog's behavior to deter him, and he leaves.\n\nNow, the key points here are safety and judgment. The author is in a vulnerable position\u2014alone with an infant. Her instincts are heightened, and she's aware of potential risks. The salesman's behavior includes asking intrusive questions and possibly inappropriate looks. She uses the dog as a deterrent, which is a common safety measure.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for judging him. On one hand, she might be accused of gender bias if she reacted differently to a woman. On the other hand, her actions were based on feeling unsafe. It's important to note that trusting one's intuition in potentially dangerous situations is often advised. \n\nAlso, the man's behavior could be seen as suspicious\u2014no company name on the van, lingering after being told the tree isn't theirs. The author's response seems reasonable given the circumstances. She didn't confront him physically but used the dog as a barrier and closed the door. \n\nIn terms of judgment, she's not necessarily being discriminatory. The situation involves a man at her door asking personal questions when she's alone with a baby. Her reaction is more about self-protection. Society often tells women to be cautious in such scenarios. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were precautionary based on her intuition and the context of being a vulnerable target. The answer should be B.\n"
