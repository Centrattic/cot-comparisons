I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a creepy vibe. The situation is that the author, a woman on maternity leave, answers the door to a man claiming to be a tree surgeon. He asks about the tree, which isn't hers, then starts asking personal questions about her baby and dog. She feels creeped out, lies about the dog, and he leaves. She's conflicted because she might be judging him just for being a man but also had a bad feeling.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. She felt unsafe, so her reaction is based on self-protection. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions, making her uncomfortable, looking at her chest\u2014could be concerning. She closed the door to protect herself and her baby, which is a natural response to feeling threatened. \n\nOn the other hand, she admits she might be profiling him because it's a man. But she also watches crime shows and had a bad feeling. The key here is that she didn't confront him aggressively; she just closed the door and he left. She didn't accuse him or call the police. Her judgment was based on her instincts, which are valid when safety is a concern.\n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. Since she took reasonable steps to ensure her safety and her baby's without escalation, I don't think she's in the wrong. People have the right to trust their instincts, especially when vulnerable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
