I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person is on maternity leave, has a baby and a dog. A salesman comes to the door about a tree in the neighbor's yard. The salesman asks questions about the baby and the dog, and the person feels a \"creepy vibe,\" especially because the man looked at their chest and kept asking about the dog's protectiveness. They lied about the dog to deter him, and he left. The person is conflicted: they feel they might be judging based on gender, but also had instincts about safety.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if their reaction was justified. The man was uninvited, asking personal questions, and staring at their chest. That's a red flag for harassment or inappropriate behavior. The person took precautions, which is reasonable. They didn't confront him aggressively but closed the door and lied to prevent a potential intrusion. \n\nOn the other hand, the person is worried about gender bias. If it were a woman, maybe they wouldn't have felt the same. But given the context\u2014personal questions, staring, and the man's behavior\u2014it's more about his actions than his gender. The person's caution is understandable, especially with a baby and a dog. \n\nSociety teaches people, especially women, to be cautious about strangers. The man's behavior crosses into uncomfortable territory by asking about the baby and dog in a way that could imply he's assessing the home's security. The van without a company name adds to the suspicion. \n\nSo, the person's judgment was based on the man's actions, not just his gender. They acted to protect their home and family. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
