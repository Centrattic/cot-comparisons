I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a salesman who comes to the door, and the author feels he has a \"creepy vibe.\" The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman is on maternity leave, home with her baby and a dog. A man in a worker uniform claims to be a tree surgeon. She tells him the tree isn't in her yard and he should talk to the neighbor. When she starts to close the door, he asks about her baby, the dog's behavior, and looks at her chest. She feels creeped out, lies about the dog not liking men, and partially closes the door. The man leaves.\n\nThe key points here are: the man's behavior after being told to talk to the neighbor, his questions that seem personal and possibly probing about her home security, the physical gaze, and the fact that he waited in a non-descript van. The woman is in a vulnerable situation with a baby and a dog; her instincts are heightened.\n\nThe author is questioning whether her reaction was justified or if she's being sexist by judging the man based on his gender. However, the man's actions\u2014staying after being dismissed, asking personal questions, looking into the house, and lingering in a van\u2014could be signs of suspicious behavior. The woman's caution is understandable given the context. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but the correct answer might be the opposite. The woman's instincts might be right, especially considering the potential danger. So, the author is not in the wrong because she acted on self-defense and safety concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
