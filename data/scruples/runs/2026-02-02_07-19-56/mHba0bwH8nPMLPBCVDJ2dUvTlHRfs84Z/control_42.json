I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a salesman coming to the door, and the author feels he had a \"creepy vibe.\" The key points are the man's behavior: asking personal questions, looking into the house, staring at her chest, and the van without company info.\n\nFirst, the author is on maternity leave, with a baby and a dog. She answers the door because she's expecting a book delivery. The man claims to be a tree surgeon about a tree not in her property. Then he asks about the dog and the baby, which she finds suspicious. She lies about the dog to shut the door, and the man leaves. She's conflicted between judging him because he's a man versus her instincts.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for judging him. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the red flags here. The man in a uniform but no company info on the van. Asks personal questions about her baby and family plans, which is unusual. Stares at her chest. She's a woman with a baby, which might make her more cautious. Her reaction is to shut the door, lie about the dog. \n\nIn terms of safety, it's better to be cautious. The man's behavior could be predatory. Even if he's a legitimate tree surgeon, his questions and gaze are inappropriate. The van without clear business info is a red flag. She's right to be suspicious. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. Her instincts are valid. She's protecting her child and herself. The answer should be B.\n"
