I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a salesman coming to the door, and the author feels creeped out and judges him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The woman is on maternity leave, has a baby and a dog. A man in a worker uniform arrives, says the tree is dead. She tells him it's the neighbor's tree. He asks about the baby, then about the dog. She feels he's looking at her chest, asking intrusive questions about the dog's protectiveness, which makes her uncomfortable. She closes the door, lies about the dog not liking men. The man leaves. She's conflicted\u2014maybe guilty about judging him because he's a man but also feels her instincts were right.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious what I think. The options are A or B. The key here is whether her reaction was justified.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a lot of discussion about personal safety, especially for women. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions after being told the tree isn't hers, looking into the house, and focusing on her baby and then her chest\u2014could be seen as suspicious. She's in a vulnerable situation with a baby, and her instincts led her to protect herself and her child. \n\nOn the other hand, she might be gender-bias, reacting more harshly to a man she wouldn't have judged a woman. But the man's actions (looking into the house, intrusive questions, possible staring at her chest) are behaviors that could be red flags. \n\nIn many cases, trusting one's intuition about potential danger is advised. Especially for someone alone with a baby, being cautious is reasonable. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trusting her gut. However, she might be overreacting if the man was genuinely trying to do his job. But without more information, her response seems justified based on the interaction. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were based on self-protection and concern for her child, which is understandable. The key points are the suspicious behavior from the man and her reasonable reaction to ensure safety.\n"
