I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for judging a salesman who gave them a \"creepy vibe.\" The scenario involves a man in a worker uniform coming to the door, talking about a dead tree, then asking personal questions about the baby and the dog, and looking at the chest. The person felt unsafe and closed the door, then lied about the dog's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the person's reaction was justified. They were on maternity leave, alone with their baby and dog. The salesman was supposed to deliver a book, but instead came to talk about a tree. That's already a red flag because he wasn't there for the expected reason. Then, after being told to talk to the neighbor, he didn't leave but asked personal questions, which is inappropriate. He looked into the house, saw the baby, and then kept asking about the dog's protectiveness. The person felt the need to lie and half-close the door for safety. \n\nThe key points here are the salesman's unexpected reason for visiting, the personal questions after being told to go, and the physical actions (looking at chest, lingering in the van). The person's actions were to protect themselves and their baby. They mention feeling judged if they were a guy, but that's about their own bias, not the situation itself. The main question is whether their judgment was wrong. \n\nIn such cases, personal safety is a priority. If someone makes you feel unsafe, especially when they're not supposed to be there, it's reasonable to take precautions. The man's behavior does seem suspicious and potentially threatening. The person isn't in the wrong for reacting to that. They didn't just profile based on his being a man; there were specific actions that triggered their suspicion. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
