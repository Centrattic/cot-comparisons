I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a salesman who came to the door, and the author felt a \"creepy vibe\" from him.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the details. The author was on maternity leave, her dog was with her, and she had a baby. A man in a worker uniform came to the door about a dead tree, which wasn't on her property. She told him to talk to the neighbor, and when she tried to close the door, he asked personal questions about her baby and dog, and looked at her chest. She felt unsafe, lied about the dog to deter him, and he left. She's conflicted: maybe she's judging him just because he's a man, or maybe she's right to be cautious.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are her safety and her reaction. She was alone with a baby and a dog. The man approached when she was vulnerable. His behavior\u2014asking personal questions, looking at her chest\u2014could be perceived as suspicious or inappropriate. Her response was to create a barrier with the door, which is a common safety measure. \n\nSocietal norms around personal space and privacy come into play. People often have a right to feel safe in their homes. The man's actions might have crossed a line by intruding on her privacy, especially when she was clearly not interested in further conversation. \n\nOn the flip side, she might be overreacting. If the man was actually trying to do his job, she might have unfairly judged him. But given the context\u2014her alone with a baby, the man's odd behavior\u2014it's reasonable for her to be cautious. \n\nThere's also the aspect of self-defense and intuition. People are taught to trust their instincts, especially in situations where they feel threatened. The fact that she took steps to secure her safety without confrontation (just closing the door) shows she wasn't aggressive, just protective.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She had a legitimate reason to feel unsafe, and her actions were a reasonable response to protect herself and her baby. The answer should be B (No).\n"
