I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a salesman who came to their door, and the person felt a \"creepy vibe\" from him. The question is whether the author is wrong for judging the salesman.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The woman is on maternity leave, has a baby and a dog. A man in a worker uniform comes to her door, initially about a tree. She tells him he needs to talk to the neighbor. She starts to close the door, but he keeps asking questions about her baby and dog. Then he looks at her chest, which makes her uncomfortable. She lies about the dog not liking men and half-closes the door as a precaution. The man leaves, and she's conflicted about whether she's being judgmental or acting on a valid hunch.\n\nSo the main points are: the man's behavior\u2014asking too many personal questions, looking at her chest, not leaving when she tried to close the door. The author's response was to lie and make the door half-shut. Now, to determine if she's wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, people have the right to feel safe in their homes. The man's actions could be seen as intrusive or inappropriate. He approached the wrong person, then kept asking personal questions after being told to talk to the neighbor. The looking at her chest is definitely a red flag. The author's response was to protect herself and her baby. Closing the door is a reasonable precaution. \n\nThere's a mention that she might be profiling because she wouldn't have reacted the same way if it were a woman. But the key here is the man's behavior, not his gender. Even if she was more cautious with men, the actions he took (invasive questions, staring) justify her suspicion. She didn't confront him aggressively; she just shut the door. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She had valid reasons to feel unsafe. The answer should be B.\n"
