I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for judging the salesman based on a \"creepy vibe.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: a man comes to the door claiming to be a tree surgeon. The woman answers while on maternity leave with a baby and a dog. The man asks about the tree, then shifts to questions about the baby and dog. She feels uncomfortable, noting he looked at her chest and asked about the dog's protectiveness. She lies about the dog not liking men and closes the door. He leaves.\n\nThe key points here are her instincts and his behavior. She felt uneasy, which is a common reaction to someone acting suspiciously. The man's behavior crosses boundaries\u2014asking personal questions after the initial purpose of the visit, looking into the house, and focusing on sensitive areas. Her reaction to close the door and lie about the dog is a protective measure for her safety and baby. \n\nThe dilemma is whether her judgment was based on sexism (assuming all men are dangerous) or valid self-defense. The fact that she acknowledges this potential bias shows self-awareness. However, trusting one's instincts in potentially threatening situations is generally advised. The man's actions, such as lingering in a non-descript van and the inappropriate questions, support her suspicion. \n\nSo, considering her safety and the man's questionable behavior, her reaction is justified. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
