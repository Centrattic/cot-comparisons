I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is on maternity leave, with a baby and a dog. They answer the door to a man in a worker uniform claiming to be a tree surgeon about a tree in the neighbor's yard. The man then asks questions about the baby and the dog, which makes the person uncomfortable, especially because he's looking at their chest. The person lies about the dog being protective and half-closes the door to prevent entry. The man leaves after sitting in his van.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel they might be judged a male for being a guy, but their instincts told them something was off. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The man's behavior: he was supposed to be there about a tree but then asked personal questions about the baby and the dog. The fact that he looked at the chest could be a red flag. The van had no company info, which is suspicious. The woman felt unsafe and took precautions, which is a natural response. \n\nSociety often tells women to be cautious, but also to trust others. The man's actions could be innocent (maybe trying to make small talk as a sales tactic), but the combination of his personal questions, the lack of company info on the van, and the staring might suggest otherwise. The woman's reaction is about self-protection, especially with a baby at home. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for judging the man. If the man's behavior was indeed suspicious, then the author's caution is justified. If the man was just doing his job and the author overreacted, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But given the context\u2014unannounced visit, personal questions, suspicious van, and the staring\u2014it's more likely the man was the one acting inappropriately. The author's actions were self-defense. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
