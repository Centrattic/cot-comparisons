I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a salesman at the door, and the author felt a 'creepy vibe' and shut the door on him. They're questioning if they're being judgmental or if their instincts were right.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man came to the door, initially about a tree. The author mentions he's in a worker uniform but the van is non-descript with no company info. That's a red flag. Then he asks intrusive questions about the baby and the dog, and looks at the author's chest. The author felt unsafe and closed the door. \n\nThe key points here are the man's behavior: asking personal questions, looking at inappropriate areas, and lingering after being told the tree isn't theirs. The author's response was to shut the door, which is a safety precaution. The user is worried about being biased against men, but the man's actions themselves are suspicious regardless of gender.\n\nIn such cases, trusting one's intuition is often advised. The author took steps to protect themselves and their baby. There's no evidence that the man was just doing his job. The fact that he sat in the van after leaving might indicate he wasn't going to move on, which adds to the unease. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being cautious. They didn't confront him or accuse him, just ended the interaction. The man's behavior raises valid concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
