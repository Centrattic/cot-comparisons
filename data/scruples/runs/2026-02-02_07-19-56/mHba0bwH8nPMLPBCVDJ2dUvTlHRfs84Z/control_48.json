I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a salesman (though actually a tree surgeon) coming to the door, interacting with the woman who's on maternity leave, and she feels he's giving off creepy vibes. She then judges him and shuts the door.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both angles. The woman was home alone with her baby and a dog. The man showed up unannounced, claimed to be a tree surgeon, but then started asking personal questions after seeing the baby. She felt uncomfortable and took precautions. \n\nThe key points here are her safety and her judgment. She was in a vulnerable situation, being a new mother with a baby at home. The man's behavior included looking into her home, asking intrusive questions, and making her feel unsafe. Her reaction of closing the door and being cautious could be seen as self-defense. \n\nOn the other hand, she acknowledges that she might be judging him based on his gender, as she wouldn't react the same to a woman. But considering the context\u2014unannounced visit, personal questions, possible inappropriate gaze\u2014her suspicion is understandable. \n\nThe question is whether her judgment was wrong. If she was protecting herself and her child, her actions are justified. However, if the man was genuinely there for business, she might have misjudged him. But given the creepy behavior described, her response isn't unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's important to trust one's instincts, especially in potentially dangerous situations. The fact that he lingered in his van after being turned away could also be a red flag. \n\nSo, considering her safety and the suspicious behavior, the author isn't in the wrong for taking precautions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
