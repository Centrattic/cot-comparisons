I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The author is on maternity leave, and a man in a worker uniform arrives to talk about a dead tree. The man is supposed to be a tree surgeon, but he's asking personal questions about the baby and the dog. The author feels creeped out because the man keeps looking at their chest and seems to be checking if the dog would protect them. They lied about the dog not liking men and half-closed the door as a precaution. The man left after sitting in his van.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's actions. They were in a vulnerable situation, alone with a baby and a dog. The man didn't immediately leave after being told it's the neighbor's tree but instead asked personal questions, which is unusual for a typical service worker. The author's response was to lie and create a barrier. The man's behavior\u2014asking about the baby's age, future children, and the dog's protectiveness, plus looking at their chest\u2014could be considered inappropriate or suspicious. \n\nThe author is worried about being judgmental based on the man's gender. But in this case, the man's actions themselves are the reason for suspicion, not just his being a man. The fact that the man didn't have a company name on his van adds to the unease. The author's intuition is making them feel unsafe, which is a valid reaction, especially when alone with a baby. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong for feeling suspicious and taking precautions. They were responding to a situation where someone who should have been a service worker was acting in a way that made them uncomfortable. The man's behavior is the key issue here, not the author's gender-based assumptions. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
