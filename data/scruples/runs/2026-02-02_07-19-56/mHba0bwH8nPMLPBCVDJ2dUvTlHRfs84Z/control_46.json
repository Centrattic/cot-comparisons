I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a salesman coming to the door, interacting with the woman, and she feels creeped out. She's wondering if she's being judgmental or if her instincts were right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man came to the door, claimed to be a tree surgeon, but the tree isn't hers. She starts to close the door, but he continues asking personal questions about her baby and the dog. He also looked at her chest, which she found creepy. She lied about the dog to deter him and then half-closed the door as a precaution. She's questioning if she's just judging him because he's a man or if her intuition was correct.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, trusting one's instincts is usually advised. The man's behavior\u2014asking intrusive questions after being told he's at the wrong house, staring at her chest, and lingering in a van without company info\u2014could be red flags. She took precautions, which is reasonable. The fact that she's a woman on maternity leave with a baby might make her more cautious. \n\nHowever, she's concerned about gender bias, as she wouldn't have reacted the same way to a woman. But that doesn't mean she's wrong. It's about acknowledging potential biases without dismissing valid concerns. The man's actions, regardless of gender, could be suspicious. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling unsafe and taking steps to protect herself. Her judgment is based on his behavior, not just his gender, even if she's aware of her own biases. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
