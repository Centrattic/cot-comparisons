I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's on maternity leave, answering a door to a salesman who's supposed to be there about a tree. The salesman then asks personal questions, looks at the baby, and the author senses something creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author felt unsafe and acted on that feeling by closing the door partially. The salesman was asking personal questions, which might be out of place. Also, he was looking at the author's chest, which is a red flag. The van didn't have a company name, which adds to the suspicion. The author is worried about being judgmental based on gender but also mentions being cautious because of forensic shows. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn the US, there's the concept of \"stand your ground\" and self-protection. The author was at home with a baby and a dog. Feeling unsafe is a valid reason to not engage further. The salesman's behavior\u2014asking personal questions, lingering, and looking at the chest\u2014could be interpreted as inappropriate. The author's response was to close the door, which is a defensive move, not an aggressive one. \n\nThe author is also reflecting on possible gender bias, which is a valid concern. However, the situation might have been a genuine threat. The fact that the salesman didn't have a company name on the van adds to the suspicion of a potential scam or worse. \n\nIn terms of legal or social norms, it's generally acceptable to be cautious, especially when in a vulnerable situation (like being a new parent alone). The author isn't accusing the salesman of anything illegal beyond their behavior, but their own safety is paramount. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on their instincts to protect themselves and their child. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
