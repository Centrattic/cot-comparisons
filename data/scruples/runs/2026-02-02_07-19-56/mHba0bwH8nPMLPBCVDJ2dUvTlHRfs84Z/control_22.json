I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a 'creepy vibe'. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is on maternity leave, alone with her baby and dog. A man knocks on the door, claiming to be a tree surgeon about a dead tree. She explains it's her neighbor's. Then, when she starts to close the door, he asks about her dog and baby, looking into the house. He keeps asking personal questions and glances at her chest. She feels creeped out, lies about the dog being protective, and half-closes the door to block him. He leaves.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted: maybe she's judging a guy just because he's a man, or maybe her instincts were right. The question is whether she was wrong.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, it's important to trust one's instincts, especially when alone with a baby. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions, lingering after being told it's not her tree, looking into the house, and staring at her chest\u2014could be red flags. She took precautions without fully closing the door, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he was just a legitimate tree surgeon trying to help. But the lack of a company van, the inappropriate questions, and her intuition (backed by her mention of watching forensic shows) suggest caution was warranted. \n\nWomen, especially in vulnerable situations (alone with a baby), have a right to be cautious. The author's actions were defensive and not aggressive. She didn't accuse him or call the police, just ended the interaction. \n\nSo, considering safety and the signs of potential threat, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
