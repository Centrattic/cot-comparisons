I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a 'creepy vibe' during an interaction.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author answers the door to a guy claiming to be a tree surgeon. The man asks about the tree, then shifts to personal questions about the baby and dog. The author feels uncomfortable, especially when he looks at their chest. They lie about the dog to deter him and close the door. The author is conflicted between feeling they judged based on gender and trusting their instincts.\n\nKey points to consider: The man made personal inquiries after the initial purpose was addressed. The author's discomfort arises from his questions and gaze, which they perceive as intrusive. They took precautions, which is a safety measure. The user is questioning if this is profiling or a legitimate safety concern.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, individuals have the right to refuse service and assess threats to their safety. The author didn't invite him in and closed the door, which is within their rights. The man's behavior might be suspicious, but without evidence, it's hard to say. However, the author isn't at fault for protecting their home and family.\n\nSocial norms: It's common to be cautious with strangers, especially when alone with a baby. The man's actions could be misinterpreted, but the author's reaction is about feeling unsafe. The user is worried about gender bias but also about safety. \n\nConclusion: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted on their instincts regarding safety, which is reasonable. The answer is B.\n"
