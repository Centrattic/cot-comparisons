I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman because they felt a \"creepy vibe.\" The situation involves a man at the door claiming to be a tree surgeon, but then asking personal questions and making the author uncomfortable. The author closed the door and felt conflicted about whether they were overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The man was at the door about a tree that isn't on the author's property. He then asked personal questions about the baby and the dog, and the author noticed he was looking at their chest. The author felt unsafe and closed the door. They're questioning if they judged him just because he was a man, but also considering their own safety instincts.\n\nTrusting one's intuition about safety is important. The author felt uneasy, which is a valid reason to be cautious. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions after the initial purpose was irrelevant, looking at inappropriate areas\u2014could be concerning. The fact that he lingered in a non-descript van might add to the suspicion. \n\nHowever, it's also true that sometimes people might overreact based on gender stereotypes. But in this case, the specific actions (personal questions, staring) are the main issues, not just the gender. The author's response was self-protective, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on their feelings of discomfort, which are legitimate when safety is a concern. It's better to err on the side of caution in such situations.\n"
