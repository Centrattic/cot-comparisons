I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for judging the salesman because he gave off a creepy vibe. The situation involves a person on maternity leave who answers the door to a man claiming to be a tree surgeon. The man asks personal questions about her baby and dog, looks at her chest, and the author feels threatened. She then closes the door and the man leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author felt a creepy vibe, which led her to be cautious. She admits to possibly gender profiling, considering she might not have reacted the same to a woman. But she also mentions her instincts were triggered, maybe from watching crime shows.\n\nThe main question is whether her reaction was justified. In such scenarios, personal safety is a primary concern. The man's behavior\u2014asking personal questions, lingering after being told the tree isn't hers, staring at her chest\u2014could be seen as inappropriate or suspicious. The author's response was to close the door and make it harder for him to enter, which is a reasonable precaution when feeling threatened.\n\nHowever, she acknowledges that she might be overreacting based on gender bias. It's possible that the man was just trying to make conversation and wasn't a threat. But in situations where someone feels unsafe, trusting their instincts is generally advised. The line between caution and profiling can be thin here. If the man had been a woman, would the reaction be the same? The author herself questions this, indicating internal conflict about potential bias.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's often encouraged to trust one's instincts for safety. The man's actions crossed boundaries by asking too many personal questions and staring inappropriately. The author's response\u2014closing the door and ending the interaction\u2014was a way to reclaim control and ensure her safety, which is valid. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety, even if it might have been a false alarm. The key here is that the feeling of being unsafe is subjective and valid regardless of the actual threat level.\n"
