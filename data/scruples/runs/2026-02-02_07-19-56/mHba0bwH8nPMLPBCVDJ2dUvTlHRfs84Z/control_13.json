I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a \"creepy vibe.\" The situation involves a man at the door claiming to be a tree surgeon, but the interaction feels uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the man approaches after the author mentions a book order, which is irrelevant. That might be a red flag right there. Then, after being told the tree isn't in her property, he doesn't leave immediately. Instead, he asks personal questions about the baby and the dog, and looks at her chest. The author feels he's assessing whether the dog would protect the baby. She lies about the dog's behavior and half-closes the door. The man's van is non-descript with no company info, which is suspicious.\n\nThe author is conflicted between possible sexism (judging a man for being a man) versus her intuition. She's a woman on maternity leave, which is a vulnerable time. Her safety is a priority. The man's behavior crosses boundaries: lingering after being denied, personal questions, and the suggestive gaze. The van without a company name adds to the suspicion. \n\nIn such scenarios, trusting one's instincts is advised, especially in potentially dangerous situations. The author took precautions to protect herself and her child, which is reasonable. While the man might have had innocent intentions, the way he acted raises valid concerns. The key points are the uninvited personal questions, inappropriate gaze, and suspicious van. The author's actions were defensive, not hostile. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
