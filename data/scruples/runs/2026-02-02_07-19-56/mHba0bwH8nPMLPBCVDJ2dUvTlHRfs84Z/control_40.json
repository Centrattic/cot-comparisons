I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling. \n\nWould you have felt suspicious at this or am I just a dick head that is profiling a guy who is just trying to drum up some business? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for judging a salesman based on a \"creepy vibe.\" The situation involves a door-to-door salesman claiming to be a tree surgeon. The author, a woman on maternity leave with a baby and a dog, answers the door. The man asks about the tree, but when she says it's the neighbor's property, he keeps asking personal questions about her baby and the dog, and she feels he's looking at her chest. She then lies about the dog being protective and closes the door. The author is conflicted because she might be stereotyping the man just for being male, but also feels her instincts were right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man was in a worker uniform but the van had no company name. That's a red flag\u2014legitimate workers usually have company branding. He asked personal questions after the business reason was dismissed. The author felt unsafe, especially when he looked at her chest. She took steps to secure the door, which is a reasonable safety measure. The question is whether her judgment was wrong.\n\nThe author's actions were based on her sense of danger. Even if the man was just trying to do business, her safety is paramount. Trusting one's instincts is generally advised, especially when there's a potential threat. The fact that she considered the possibility of profiling but chose to act on her gut feeling is important. The man's behavior\u2014personal questions, lack of company info, staring\u2014could be concerning. \n\nHowever, the alternative is that he was just being pushy or awkward. But given the context of being at someone's home, especially a woman alone with a baby, the author's caution is understandable. The answer would hinge on whether her reaction was reasonable given the circumstances. Since she didn't confront him but took precautions to protect herself and her child, it's hard to say she was in the wrong just for being cautious. So the answer is B.\n"
