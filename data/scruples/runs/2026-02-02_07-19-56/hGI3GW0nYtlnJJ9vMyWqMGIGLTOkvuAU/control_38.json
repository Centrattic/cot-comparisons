Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset at his girlfriend for using the n-word. The situation is that the girlfriend said the n-word in a group where there were white friends and one African friend. She used it in the context of threatening to report people who smell like weed, implying she'd rat out Black people. The author confronted her, she got upset, called him a control freak, and then later acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, the n-word is a highly offensive racial slur with a history of being used to demean Black people. Even if she didn't intend it that way, using it in that context could be seen as dehumanizing or stereotyping. The author's reaction is understandable because he's addressing the use of a harmful term. However, how he handled it matters. He \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was harsh or confrontational. That could have escalated the situation, leading to her crying and feeling controlled. \n\nBut the key point is that the girlfriend used a racist term. The author has a right to be upset about that. Even if his confrontation was perhaps too intense, the initial use of the slur is the main issue. The girlfriend's apology and subsequent denial might indicate she didn't take the issue seriously enough, which could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author yelled at her and made her feel controlled, maybe his approach was too aggressive. But the fact that she later dismissed it by acting like nothing happened might show a lack of accountability on her part. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is that his girlfriend used a racist term. His reaction, while possibly too harsh, is a response to that. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his response was justified. Since using the n-word is clearly wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. However, his method of confrontation might need adjustment. But the core issue is her use of the slur. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
