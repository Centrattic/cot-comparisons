Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who is white, used the n-word in front of their friends, including an African and a Nigerian person. The author got upset and confronted her, leading to an argument where she called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a long history of being used to dehumanize and oppress Black people. Even if the girlfriend was joking or in a moment of anger, using that word is problematic, especially in a group that includes people of African descent. The author was right to be upset because such language can be deeply hurtful and perpetuates racial harm.\n\nThe author confronted her, and while she apologized immediately, the author's reaction might have been too harsh. If he yelled at her and made her cry, that could be seen as overreacting. However, the issue is the use of a racist slur. The author's intention was to address the offensive language, which is a valid concern. But the way he handled it\u2014leaning in hard and causing her to cry\u2014might have been inappropriate, even if the intent was right. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's use of the term was definitely wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. However, his method of confrontation might have been too aggressive. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for his reaction. \n\nIf the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), it would be because his reaction was too harsh. If B (No), it's because he was right to address the offensive language. The key here is that using the n-word is wrong, so the author had a valid reason to be upset. However, his approach might have been too confrontational. The girlfriend's apology and her acting like nothing happened the next day could indicate she didn't take the issue seriously, which might reflect on the author's need to address it more effectively. \n\nBut the main issue is the initial use of the slur. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was in response to a serious problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe his approach could have been better. However, the question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend used an offensive term, the author's reaction was justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
