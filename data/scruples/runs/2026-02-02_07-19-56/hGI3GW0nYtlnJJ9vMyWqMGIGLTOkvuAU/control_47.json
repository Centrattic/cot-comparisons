Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy (author) got upset when his girlfriend used the n-word. The girlfriend was already on edge because she had been ticketed for weed, and in a group of mostly white friends with one African friend. She made a comment that if she smells weed, she'd rat out the \"n-words,\" which caused a lot of tension.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the use of a racial slur. The n-word is a deeply offensive term with a long history of being used to dehumanize Black people. Even if the girlfriend used it in a moment of anger or frustration, the fact that she used such a derogatory term is problematic. The author was right to confront her because that language is harmful and shouldn't be used in any context, especially when someone from the affected community is present.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014crying and calling the author a control freak\u2014might suggest she felt attacked, but that doesn't negate the wrongness of her initial comment. The author had the right to express his discomfort and the impact of her words. It's important to address such language to prevent it from being normalized or excused as a joke or momentary lapse. The fact that she apologized immediately is a good sign, but the author's response was appropriate to hold her accountable. \n\nThe friends' reactions, like the Nigerian friend tapping him, also indicate that the comment was out of place. The author's role in calling her out was necessary to address the hurtful language. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because he was right to be upset about the use of the slur and to confront her about it.\n"
