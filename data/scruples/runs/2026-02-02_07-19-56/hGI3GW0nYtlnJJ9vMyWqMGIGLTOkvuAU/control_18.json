Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend used a racial slur, specifically the n-word, in front of their friends, including someone from Africa. The author got upset, confronted her, she cried and called him a control freak, then acted like nothing happened the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was upset about being ticketed for weed, and when she heard about the smell of weed on the floor, she made a derogatory comment. The fact that she used the n-word is a big deal because it's a highly offensive term with a long history of racial hatred. Even if she was angry, using such a slur is problematic and hurtful, especially in a group that includes someone from the affected community.\n\nThe author's reaction was to confront her about being more careful with her language. That seems reasonable because using offensive language can cause harm, and the author is advocating for respect and sensitivity. The girlfriend's response was to cry and accuse him of being a control freak, which suggests she felt attacked or defensive. However, the author's concern isn't about controlling her, but about the impact of her words.\n\nThe next day, she acted like nothing happened, which might indicate she didn't take the issue seriously. The author's initial reaction was to address the slur, which was necessary. So, the author isn't in the wrong for holding her accountable for using a racial slur. The girlfriend was in the wrong for using that term, and the author's response was appropriate in pointing that out.\n"
