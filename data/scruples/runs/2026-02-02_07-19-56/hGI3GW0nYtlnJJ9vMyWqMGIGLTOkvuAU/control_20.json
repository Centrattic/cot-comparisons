Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the girlfriend said the n-word in front of friends, including a Nigerian person. The author was upset, confronted her, and she cried, called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened. The main issue here is whether the author overreacted or was justified in his response.\n\nThe n-word is a highly offensive racial slur with a long history of dehumanizing Black people. Using it in any context is generally considered unacceptable and deeply hurtful. The girlfriend's use of it, even in a rant, is problematic. The author's reaction is based on the offensiveness of the word and the presence of a Nigerian friend, who might feel particularly targeted.\n\nNow, the author's response: he confronted her, which is understandable given the severity of the slur. However, the way he did it\u2014yelling at her, leading to her crying and feeling controlled\u2014raises questions. Was his approach too harsh? Maybe. Confronting someone about using a racial slur is necessary, but the method matters. Yelling could be seen as aggressive, which might not be the most constructive way to address the issue. However, the content of the message (using a slur) is so serious that some level of confrontation is warranted.\n\nThe girlfriend apologized immediately, which is a positive step. But then she dismissed the issue the next day, which could indicate she didn't take it seriously. The author's concern about her language and its impact is valid. The question is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. While the slur is wrong, responding with yelling might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. A more calm and direct approach might have been better, but the author's intent was to address the harmful language.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The girlfriend definitely used a slur, which is on her. The author's reaction, while well-intentioned, might have been too harsh, but his concern is justified. The key point is that the author was addressing a serious issue. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the main problem here, not the author's response, unless his method was overly cruel. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because he was addressing a serious issue, even if his approach could have been improved.\n"
