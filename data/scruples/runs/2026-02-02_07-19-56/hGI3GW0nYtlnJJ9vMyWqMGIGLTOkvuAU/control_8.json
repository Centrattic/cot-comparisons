Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend using a racial slur around friends, including someone from Nigeria, and the author responding by confronting her and arguing, which led to her crying and feeling controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the n-word. That's a highly offensive term, especially towards Black people. The fact that the girlfriend used it in front of friends, one of whom is African, is definitely problematic. The author was right to be upset because using such a slur is hurtful and perpetuates racism.\n\nNow, the author's response: he leaned into her \"pretty hard,\" which might be a bit harsh. Confronting someone after they've made a harmful mistake is important, but the approach matters. If he yelled at her, that could be seen as aggressive. However, given the severity of the slur, his concern about her language and its impact is valid. He wasn't just trying to control her; he was addressing a harmful statement.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was to cry and call him a control freak. That suggests she felt attacked, which might be because the confrontation was too intense. But the core issue is her use of the slur. The author had a right to be upset and to express that. The next day, she acted like nothing happened, which might indicate she didn't take the problem seriously, but the initial response was the author's duty as her partner to address the offensive remark.\n\nSo, while the author's approach might have been a bit heavy-handed, the main issue is the girlfriend's use of a racial slur. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and confronting her. The answer is B.\n"
