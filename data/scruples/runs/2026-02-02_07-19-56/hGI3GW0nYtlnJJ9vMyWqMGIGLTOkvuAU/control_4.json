Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend using a racial slur, and the author getting upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made a derogatory comment using the n-word. That's clearly offensive and hurtful. The author's initial reaction was to confront her, which is understandable because they were in a room with friends, including someone from Nigeria. The immediate silence and the Nigerian friend's reaction show how inappropriate her comment was.\n\nThe author then \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean they were confrontational or harsh. The girlfriend cried and accused them of being a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened, which could indicate she didn't take the issue seriously.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is definitely wrong. The author's response was to confront her, which is necessary because such language is unacceptable. However, the way the author handled it might have been too harsh, leading to an emotional outburst. The girlfriend's apology was immediate, but her quick return to normal behavior the next day suggests she might not have fully grasped the severity.\n\nThe author's right to be upset is valid because they were there with friends who were affected. Confronting her is a responsible action, but the approach might have been heavy-handed. The girlfriend's accusation of being a control freak could be a defensive reaction. However, the author is not in the wrong for addressing the slur. The main issue was the girlfriend's use of the slur, so the author's response, while maybe strong, was in response to her wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the primary issue here.\n"
