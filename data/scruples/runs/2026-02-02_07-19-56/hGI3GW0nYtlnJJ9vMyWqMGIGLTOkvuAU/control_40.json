Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The situation is that they're all white except one African friend. The girlfriend says that when she smells weed, she'll rat out the \"n-words.\" The author confronts her, she cries, calls him a control freak, and then acts like nothing happened the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why using the n-word is offensive. The n-word is a racial slur with a long history of being used to dehumanize and oppress Black people. Even if the person using it is from a different background, it's still harmful and perpetuates racism. The girlfriend's comment not only uses a slur but also links it to drug-related stereotypes, which are harmful as well. \n\nThe author was upset and confronted her, which makes sense because her language was offensive. But the girlfriend reacted with crying and calling him a control freak. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's use of the slur is clearly wrong. The author had a valid reason to be upset and address it. However, how he confronted her\u2014yelling and being hard on her\u2014might not have been the best approach. But given the context, his reaction is understandable. The girlfriend's apology and then acting like nothing happened the next day is problematic because it shows a lack of accountability. \n\nThe key points here are the use of a racial slur, the author's justified concern, and the girlfriend's dismissive behavior. The author wasn't wrong to be upset, but maybe he could have handled it more calmly. However, the main issue is her use of the slur, which is a big problem. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
