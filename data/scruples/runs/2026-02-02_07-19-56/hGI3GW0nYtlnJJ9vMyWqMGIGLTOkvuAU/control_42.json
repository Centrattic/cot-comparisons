Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend said the n-word during a conversation with friends, including one African person. The author got upset, confronted her, she apologized, but later the author yelled at her, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the n-word. It's a highly offensive term with a history of racism and oppression. Even if used in a different context (like a joke or slang), it can be deeply hurtful. The girlfriend used it in a group, which might not be the best context, especially with someone from Africa present. But the user is a white person, as is the girlfriend, and the African friend is also part of the group. The girlfriend had been recently ticketed for weed, so maybe she was stressed. However, using that word is still problematic regardless of context.\n\nThe author's reaction is getting upset and confronting her. The girlfriend apologized immediately, which is a good sign. But then when they were alone, the author \"leaned into her pretty hard\" about it. The term \"lean into\" might mean he was more forceful or harsh in his criticism. He yelled at her, which could escalate the situation. The girlfriend's response was to call him a control freak, which suggests she felt attacked or controlled. The next day, she called him and acted like nothing happened, maybe indicating she's moving on quickly, but that doesn't mean the issue is resolved.\n\nSo, the key points are: use of a racial slur, the author's immediate reaction (confronting her, which is appropriate), but then yelling and being harsh when alone, leading to her emotional response. The girlfriend apologized right away, showing she might realize it was wrong. However, the author's method of addressing it later could be seen as overreacting. It's important to handle such situations with care and understanding, not aggression. The author might have been right to address it, but the way he did it\u2014yelling and being controlling\u2014could be in the wrong. The girlfriend's use of the slur is definitely wrong, but the author's approach to addressing it may not be the healthiest. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because of his harsh reaction, even if the initial issue is serious.\n"
