Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend said the n-word in front of friends, including someone African. The author got upset, confronted her, she apologized, then later the author \"leaned into her pretty hard\" about her language, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, the n-word is a highly offensive racial slur. Even if the girlfriend used it in the heat of the moment, using such a term is inappropriate and harmful. The author was right to be upset and to address it. However, the way he \"leaned into her pretty hard\" might come across as aggressive or controlling. Confronting someone about offensive language is important, but the approach matters. Yelling at her could have been more hurtful, especially if it's seen as an overreaction or if it's part of a pattern of controlling behavior. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the confrontation was too intense for her. \n\nBut the key point is that using the n-word is unacceptable. The author had every right to be upset. However, the method of addressing it might not have been the best. The girlfriend apologizing immediately shows she recognized the mistake. The author's approach might have been too harsh, leading to her feeling controlled. So, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but his method of addressing it could be problematic. But according to the options, it's either A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). Since the main issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur, the author was right to confront her. The problem might be how he did it, but the core issue is her language. So the answer is B.\n"
