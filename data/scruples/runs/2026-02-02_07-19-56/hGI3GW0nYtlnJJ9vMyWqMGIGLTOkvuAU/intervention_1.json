Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. First, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe girlfriend used a racial slur in front of friends, including someone from Nigeria. The author confronted her, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girlfriend made a racist remark, which was offensive, especially with a Black friend present. The author felt it was important to address it, which is a valid reaction. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling at her, being confrontational\u2014might have been too harsh, leading her to feel attacked. \n\nBut the girlfriend using the n-word is a serious issue. Even if she apologized, the act itself is harmful. The author had the right to be upset, but the method of addressing it could have been more constructive. However, the girlfriend's reaction of crying and calling him a control freak might indicate that the confrontation was too intense. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong: Confronting offensive language is important, but how it's done matters. Yelling and being hard on her might not be the best approach. But the girlfriend's use of a racial slur is definitely not okay. The author's intent was to address the problem, but the method could have been improved. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. However, the girlfriend's use of the slur is the main issue here. The author's reaction was a response to that, so he's not in the wrong for being upset, but maybe how he handled it wasn't the best. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is her using the n-word. The author's reaction is a response to her action. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, maybe the way he confronted her could be seen as harsh, but the primary wrong was her using the slur. The author's response was a valid reaction to her wrongdoing. So, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B because confronting offensive language is right, even if the method could be better. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset; the girlfriend is in the wrong for using the slur. So, the answer is B.\n"
