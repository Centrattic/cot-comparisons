Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong when his girlfriend used the n-word and he got upset. The situation is that they were with friends, including someone African, and after she said the n-word, the room went silent, a Nigerian friend confronted her in a joking way, she apologized, then when they were alone, the author confronted her more seriously, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the n-word refers to. The n-word is a highly offensive racial slur directed at Black people. Even though the girlfriend used it in a specific context, the word itself is inherently derogatory. So, her using it was wrong regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author got upset and confronted her. That seems justified because using such a slur is harmful and unacceptable. But he \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was harsh or overbearing in his response. She cried and felt controlled. The author's reaction might be seen as valid due to the offensive language, but the way he handled it could have been part of the issue. However, the main problem is her using the slur, not his response. The fact that she apologized immediately shows she recognized it was wrong, but the author's responsibility is to address it. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior was clearly problematic. Using the n-word is a serious offense, and the author is right to be upset. While his approach might have been too intense, the core issue is her language. The friends' reactions (shock, confrontation) also indicate the severity. The girlfriend later called him a control freak, which might deflect from her responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is not in the wrong for addressing the offensive language. Even if his tone was harsh, the act of confronting her is appropriate. The question is whether the author is wrong. The answer is B (No), because she used a racial slur, and he had a right to be upset and address it. His approach could be discussed, but he's not in the wrong here.\n"
