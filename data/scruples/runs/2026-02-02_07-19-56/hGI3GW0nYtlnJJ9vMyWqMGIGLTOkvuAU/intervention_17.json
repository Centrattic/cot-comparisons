Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in a group, including a Nigerian friend, and the author got upset, confronted her, she apologized, and then later called him a control freak when he talked to her about it.\n\nFirst, the n-word is a highly offensive and racist term with a long history of being used to dehumanize Black people. Even if the girlfriend was upset or angry, using that word is a serious issue. The fact that she used it in front of a Nigerian friend, who is Black, makes it even more problematic because it's directed at someone from that background. \n\nThe author's reaction is to confront her about it, which is understandable since the term is hurtful and harmful. The girlfriend immediately apologized after the Nigerian friend confronted her, which might indicate she realized the mistake. However, when the author later discusses it with her in private, she gets defensive, calls him a control freak, and then acts like nothing happened the next day. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's right to be upset about racism is valid. The girlfriend made a racist remark, which is offensive regardless of intent. The author's approach of confronting her and talking about the impact of her words is appropriate. But when he \"leaned into her pretty hard\" and \"yelled at her,\" maybe that escalated the situation. However, considering the gravity of the word used, being firm is necessary. The girlfriend's reaction of crying and calling him a control freak might be a way to deflect accountability, which isn't right. \n\nThe key here is that using a racial slur is always wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. Even if his approach was harsh, the core issue is her use of the offensive term. The girlfriend's behavior of apologizing in front of others but then denying responsibility later is concerning. The author is not the one who used the slur, so he's not at fault. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
