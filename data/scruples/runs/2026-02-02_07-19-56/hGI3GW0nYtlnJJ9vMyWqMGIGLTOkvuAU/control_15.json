Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let me look at the situation again. The author is white, their girlfriend is also white, and they were with friends, most of whom are white except one African friend. The girlfriend, after getting a text about weed on her dorm floor and being upset because she was ticketed for weed earlier, made a comment using the n-word. The room went silent, the Nigerian friend confronted her jokingly but she apologized. Then the author confronted her more seriously, and she got upset, calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the n-word means. It's a highly offensive racial slur targeting Black people. Even if someone uses it in a different context, like a slang term among certain groups, using it in a public or mixed company setting can be hurtful and offensive. The girlfriend said it in front of the author's friends, including the African friend, which is a big issue. The author was upset and addressed her, which might have been the right thing to do.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction: she cried and called him a control freak. The author might have been firm, but the key point is about the use of a racial slur. The girlfriend apologized immediately after being confronted by the Nigerian friend, so that's a positive step. But the author then \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which could mean he was aggressive or harsh in his response. Even if the author is right to be upset about the slur, the way he handled it might have been too intense, leading her to feel attacked. \n\nThe next morning, she called him and was talking like nothing happened. This might imply that she didn't take the issue seriously the next day, which could be a problem. But the author's initial reaction\u2014confronting her for using a racial slur\u2014is justified. The question is whether the author was wrong in his approach. If he yelled at her, that might have been an overreaction, but the core issue of calling out the slur isn't wrong. However, the girlfriend's use of the n-word is definitely problematic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is not in the wrong for being upset about his girlfriend using a racial slur. However, if he yelled at her, maybe he could have handled it more calmly. But the main issue here is her use of the slur, which is clearly wrong. So the author's response might have been appropriate in intent, even if the method could have been better. The girlfriend's apology shows she recognized the mistake, but the author's firmness might have been necessary. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was appropriate. Since the girlfriend used a racial slur, the author had every right to be upset and to address it. Even if he was a bit harsh, the core issue is her using offensive language. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak might be deflecting. The author isn't in the wrong for confronting her. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend made a mistake, and the author was right to address it, even if the method could have been improved. But the user is asking about being \"in the wrong,\" so the main wrong here is the girlfriend's use of the slur. The author's actions are a response to that, so he's not the one at fault.\n"
