Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in front of their friends, including someone from Nigeria. The author got upset and confronted her, leading to an argument. Now the question is whether the author was wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend said the n-word, which is a highly offensive racial slur. Even if she used it in a moment of anger or frustration, the term itself is deeply hurtful and has a long history of oppression and bigotry. The fact that she said it in front of their friends, including someone from an African country, probably made the situation even more hurtful. The friends were shocked, and one of them confronted her, which suggests that her comment was not only offensive but also clearly out of place.\n\nThe author reacted by confronting her and telling her to be more careful with her language. He leaned into it \"pretty hard,\" which might mean he was firm or perhaps a bit harsh. She then cried and called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened, which adds another layer to the situation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, using the n-word is a serious issue. As a white person, using that term, especially in a derogatory way, is not acceptable. The author was trying to address her language, which is a valid concern. However, the way he did it\u2014yelling at her and making her cry\u2014could be seen as overreacting. But is that being a control freak? Maybe he felt the need to address it because of the offensive nature of the word, not to control her. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt that the author was being overly critical or judgmental, especially if she didn't realize the severity of her mistake. However, the fact that she apologized immediately after the comment shows she recognized it was wrong. The author's reaction was to hold her accountable, which is reasonable given the context. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong here? The key points are: the girlfriend used a racial slur, the author confronted her, their argument followed. The author's intention was to address the offensive language, which is a valid point. However, the method of confrontation\u2014yelling and making her cry\u2014might be seen as harsh. But considering the severity of the n-word, the author's reaction could be justified as necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have handled it more calmly, but the act of addressing it is not wrong. The girlfriend's use of the term is the main issue. The author was trying to correct her, which is not controlling but rather standing against racism. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
