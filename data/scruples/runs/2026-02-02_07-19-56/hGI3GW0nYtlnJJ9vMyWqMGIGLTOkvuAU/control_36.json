Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in front of their friends, including someone from Africa, and then the author confronted her, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is clearly offensive. The author was upset and confronted her. But the girlfriend apologized immediately, and later the author yelled at her, making her cry and call him a control freak. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The girlfriend's use of the n-word was inappropriate and hurtful. 2) The author's reaction might be seen as necessary to address the offensive comment, but maybe his approach (yelling) was too harsh. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend made a mistake by using a racial slur, especially in front of people from the affected community. The author's response to confront her about the language is understandable, as it's important to hold people accountable for such language. However, \"leaning into her pretty hard\" and yelling might have escalated the situation. But considering the severity of the slur, the author's reaction could be seen as justified in terms of addressing the issue, even if the method was a bit harsh. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's immediate apology suggests she recognized her mistake, which could mean the author's strong reaction was unnecessary after that. But the fact that the author was trying to make her aware of the impact of her words is a positive step. \n\nSo, in terms of who is in the wrong: The girlfriend definitely used a harmful term, which is wrong. The author's response might not be entirely right in terms of the approach, but he's not in the wrong because he was addressing her harmful behavior. The main issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur, not the author's reaction. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
