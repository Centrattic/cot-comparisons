Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset at his girlfriend for using the n-word in a group that includes a Nigerian friend. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The girlfriend said the n-word in a group where there was an African/Nigerian individual present. That's a significant point because using that term is a racial slur and can be deeply offensive, especially in front of someone from that community.\n\nThe girlfriend's initial reaction was to rant about being ticketed for weed, then made the derogatory comment. The author confronted her after the fact, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened. \n\nThe key issues here are the use of a racial slur and the author's response. Using the n-word is inherently wrong and offensive. The girlfriend's use of it in front of a Nigerian person is particularly hurtful. The author's reaction, while intense (yelling, confronting her), is in response to her using a harmful term. \n\nHowever, the author's approach could be problematic. Yelling might not be the best way to address the issue, but the underlying issue is the racial slur. The girlfriend's apology was immediate, but she later dismissed the conversation, which could indicate she didn't take it seriously. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main wrong here is the girlfriend's use of the slur. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to her wrongdoing. If the author is being labeled a control freak for addressing her offensive language, that's a mischaracterization. His concern is about respecting others' feelings, which is valid. However, how he addressed it (yelling) might not be the best approach, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong in the moral sense. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the main issue. The answer should be B.\n"
