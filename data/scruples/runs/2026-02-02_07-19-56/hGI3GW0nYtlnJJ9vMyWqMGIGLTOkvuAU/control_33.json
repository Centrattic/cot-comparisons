Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. So, first, I need to consider the context.\n\nThe girlfriend used a racial slur in front of friends, including someone from the affected community. The author confronted her, which led to her crying and accusing him of being a control freak. The key points here are the use of a harmful slur and the author's reaction. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's action is problematic. The n-word is a deeply offensive term with a history of dehumanizing Black people. Using it, even in a joking or ranting manner, is hurtful and perpetuates racism. The fact that she said it in front of friends, including a Nigerian person, makes the situation more severe because it directly affects members of the targeted group.\n\nThe author's response was to confront her about being careful with her language. Confronting someone about using a slur is generally the right thing to do, especially when it offends others. However, the author \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was harsh in his approach. Yelling at her could have been an overreaction, leading to her emotional response. \n\nBut even if the approach was a bit intense, the underlying issue is valid. The girlfriend's use of the slur is wrong, and the author has a responsibility to address it. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak and the next day acting like nothing happened might indicate she's dismissing the seriousness of her own words. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The main issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit strong, stems from a valid concern about respecting others and using appropriate language. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
