Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word around friends, including someone from Nigeria. The girlfriend apologized immediately but then the author confronted her strongly, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend made a racist remark, which is clearly wrong. The author was upset and confronted her, which is a valid reaction to racism. However, the way he handled it might be the issue. He \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which could mean he was aggressive or confrontational. She apologized immediately, so maybe she recognized her mistake. The author's response might have been too harsh, leading to her feeling attacked rather than supported. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend later acted like nothing happened, which complicates things. The author's reaction might have contributed to her avoiding the issue later. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. Confronting someone about using a racial slur is important, but doing it in a way that makes them defensive or feel controlled could be counterproductive. The girlfriend's initial apology suggests she regretted it, so the author's harsh response might have been unnecessary. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of a Nigerian friend shows that the girlfriend's comment had real impact, and the author's role in addressing it is valid. But the method of addressing it matters. Yelling and making her feel like a control freak might not be the right approach. It's possible the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but their method of handling it could be seen as wrong. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur, so the author's reaction is justified. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's approach was too harsh and caused unnecessary harm, then maybe A. But if the author was right to address the racism, then B. The line between being right to confront racism and being overly controlling is thin here. The girlfriend's immediate apology and then brushing it off the next day suggests she didn't take it seriously, which might mean the author's strong reaction was warranted. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because addressing racial slurs is important, and while the approach could be better, the core issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur. The author's reaction, though perhaps heavy-handed, is a response to racism. So answer B.\n"
