Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend using a racial slur in front of friends, including someone from Africa. The author got upset, confronted her, and she ended up crying and yelling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend used the n-word, which is a highly offensive term. Even if it was in a moment of anger or frustration, the use of such a word is problematic. The author's reaction\u2014being upset and confronting her\u2014is a natural response to hearing someone use a slur. However, the way he handled it might be questionable. He \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which could mean he was harsh or confrontational. That might have contributed to her emotional response. \n\nThe girlfriend apologized immediately after the incident, which shows she recognized the mistake. But the author's approach led to a confrontation that resulted in her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened, which complicates things further. \n\nNow, the key points are: Did the author overreact? Is it wrong to confront someone about using a racial slur, even if the approach was a bit forceful? The girlfriend's use of the slur is clearly inappropriate. The author's right to express his disapproval is valid. However, the method of confrontation matters. If he was yelling at her, that's one thing. But the term \"leaned into her pretty hard\" might just mean he was firm but not necessarily yelling. The girlfriend's reaction of crying and calling him a control freak suggests she felt attacked. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: Both parties might have some accountability. The girlfriend used an offensive term, which is inexcusable. The author had the right to address it, but handling it in a way that caused her emotional distress might be his fault. However, given the seriousness of the slur, the author's concern is justified. The question is whether his response was in the wrong. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, possibly because they believe the girlfriend's apology and the author's harsh reaction made things worse. But in terms of right and wrong, the use of the slur is the bigger issue. The author's response was a valid reaction, even if the approach could be improved. So, the answer might be B: No, the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's use of the slur is the main problem, and the author had a right to confront her.\n"
