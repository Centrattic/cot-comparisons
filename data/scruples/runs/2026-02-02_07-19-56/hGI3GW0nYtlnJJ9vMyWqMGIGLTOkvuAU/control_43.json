Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who is white, used the n-word in front of their friends, including a Nigerian friend. The author got upset, confronted her, and she cried, calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The n-word is a racial slur with a long history of harm and is widely considered offensive. The girlfriend used it in a context where there were people of different races present. Even if she didn't intend to be racist, using that word is problematic. The author's reaction is about calling her out for using a harmful term, which could have hurt feelings, especially in that mixed company.\n\nBut then, the author \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was confrontational. The girlfriend cried and felt controlled. So, the user is asking if the author is wrong for reacting this way.\n\nOn one hand, it's important to address the use of such a slur, regardless of intent. The author was right to be upset because the word is offensive. On the other hand, how he addressed it might have been too harsh. Confronting her in a way that led her to cry and feel controlled could be seen as overstepping, even if his intentions were good. However, the girlfriend's apology and then acting like nothing happened the next day might indicate she didn't take it seriously enough.\n\nThe key point is whether the author was wrong for getting upset. The use of the n-word is a serious issue, and the author had a right to be concerned about the impact of her words. However, the way he handled the confrontation might have been too aggressive. But the question is specifically if he's in the wrong. Since using the slur is wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend is the one who used the offensive term. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most effective, isn't necessarily wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
