Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend using the n-word, the author getting upset, and their subsequent argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is a serious issue. The author confronted her, which could be seen as appropriate because using such language is harmful and offensive. However, the way he handled it might have been problematic. He \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was aggressive or harsh. She then cried and called him a control freak, which suggests the confrontation was intense.\n\nThe girlfriend apologized immediately after the incident, so she might have recognized her mistake. The author's reaction could be justified in addressing the use of a slur, but his approach might have been too harsh, leading to her emotional reaction. On the other hand, calling someone a control freak because they address harmful language might be dismissive of the actual issue.\n\nI need to think about whether the author had the right to be upset. Using the n-word is a big deal, especially in a group with someone from an affected background. The author's friends were shocked, which shows the slur was out of place. So, the author's reaction seems valid in that he was addressing a harmful statement. However, his method of confrontation may have been too intense, leading to a negative response from his girlfriend. \n\nThe next morning, she acted like nothing happened, which might indicate she didn't take the issue seriously, but the initial apology suggests some remorse. The key here is whether the author's anger was justified. Since he was addressing a racial slur, which is a serious matter, his upset is understandable. However, the way he handled the confrontation might have been too harsh, contributing to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about the slur. The girlfriend's use of the word was wrong, and the author had a right to address it. However, the approach taken could have been more constructive. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the main issue was the girlfriend's use of the slur, the author's reaction is more about addressing a serious problem. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
