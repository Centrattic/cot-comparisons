Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend using the n-word in a group that includes a Nigerian friend. The author (the person posting) got upset and confronted her, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is clearly problematic. The fact that there's a Nigerian person in the room makes it even more offensive because the term is derogatory towards Black people. The author addressing her use of the word seems justified because it's a hurtful and inappropriate term. However, the way the author handled it might be a point of contention. He \"leaned into her pretty hard\" which could mean he was aggressive or confrontational. The girlfriend reacted emotionally, crying and calling him a control freak. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the girlfriend used a racial slur, the author confronted her, and the girlfriend felt controlled. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author was right to address the offensive language, then he's not in the wrong. But if his approach was too harsh or controlling, maybe he shares some blame. However, using the n-word is a serious issue, and confronting someone about it, even in an intense way, might be understandable. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak could be a deflection. \n\nI should also consider that the girlfriend apologized immediately after the comment, which is a positive step. But the fact that she later acted like nothing happened might indicate she didn't take it seriously. The author's response, while perhaps intense, is about holding her accountable for a racial slur. So, the author is on the right side of addressing the offensive language. The girlfriend might have been in the wrong for using the term, and the author's reaction, though causing conflict, is about a valid issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
