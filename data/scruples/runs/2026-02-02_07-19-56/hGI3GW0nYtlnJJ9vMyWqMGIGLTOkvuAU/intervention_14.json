Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend using a racial slur, and them getting upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend used the n-word, which is a highly offensive term. Even if she didn't intend to be malicious, the act of using such a slur is problematic. The author reacted by confronting her, which is understandable given the context. However, he \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" causing her to cry and yell, calling him a control freak. \n\nNow, the key points here are the immediate reaction and the severity. Confronting someone about a racial slur is justified, but doing so in a way that's overly aggressive or harsh could be seen as wrong. The girlfriend apologized immediately, showing she recognized her mistake. The author's response, while addressing her mistake, might have been too intense, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, using the n-word is a serious issue, and the author had the right to express his concern. The problem might be the tone and approach rather than the intent itself. The girlfriend then acted like nothing happened the next day, which could indicate she didn't fully grasp the severity or was dismissive. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for being upset, but his approach might have been heavy-handed. The girlfriend used an offensive term, which is a major issue, but the way the author handled it could have been more constructive. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's a balance. The girlfriend made a mistake, and the author's reaction, while intense, was in response to that. However, yelling and making her cry might have been excessive. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the way he handled it, but not entirely. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given the context, using the n-word is the bigger issue, so the author's response, while perhaps harsh, might not make him entirely in the wrong. But if the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because the girlfriend's action was more offensive, and the author's reaction was a response to her mistake, even if it was intense.\n"
