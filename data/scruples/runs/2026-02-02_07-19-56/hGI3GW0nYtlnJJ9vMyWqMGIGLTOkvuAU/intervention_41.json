Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend using a racial slur, and then he confronts her, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is white, and so is the author. The group includes friends who are all white except one African friend. She texts that the floor smells like weed and the police are there. Earlier that day, she was ticketed for weed. She gets upset, rants, and then uses the n-word. The room goes silent, a Nigerian friend confronts her in a joking way. She apologizes immediately. Then when they're alone, the author \"leans into her pretty hard,\" meaning he confronts her more seriously. She starts crying and yells he's a control freak, and the next day she acts like nothing happened.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is offensive and harmful. The author is addressing her language, which is appropriate. However, the way he confronts her might be an issue. If he yelled at her, maybe he was aggressive. On the other hand, the girlfriend's response is to call him a control freak and then pretend it didn't happen. That could be dismissive of the seriousness of the slur. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The girlfriend used the n-word, which is a severe racial slur with a long history of dehumanizing Black people. Even if she was upset or in a moment of anger, using that word is never acceptable. The author's reaction is to address her choice of words and the impact they have. However, if he yelled at her, perhaps his approach was confrontational. Yet, the girlfriend apologized right after the incident, but when the author tried to discuss it privately, she reacted defensively. \n\nThe next morning, she acts like nothing happened, which might indicate she's not taking the issue seriously. So, the author's concern is valid. However, the way he handled it might have been too harsh. But considering that the n-word is a deeply offensive term and the girlfriend used it in front of friends, including someone from Nigeria, the author's action to discuss the issue is justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's use of the slur is the main problem here. The author is not in the wrong for addressing it. Even if the confrontation could have been handled more gently, the fact remains that his girlfriend said something offensive, and he had a right to be upset and bring it up. Her crying and calling him a control freak might be a way to deflect responsibility, which is a common tactic. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's use of the n-word is the key issue, and the author is right to hold her accountable, even if the method could have been better. The user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong might be because of the girlfriend's emotional reaction, but the severity of the slur makes the author's reaction appropriate.\n"
