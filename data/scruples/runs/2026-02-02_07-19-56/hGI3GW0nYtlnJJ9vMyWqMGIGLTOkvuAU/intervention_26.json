Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The author's friend is African, and the girlfriend said the word in a rant about being ticketed for weed. The author confronted her, she cried, called him a control freak, and then acted like nothing happened the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a highly offensive racial slur with a history of oppression and discrimination. Even if the girlfriend was using it in a different context, like anger or frustration, its use is problematic because of its derogatory nature. The fact that there's a Black person present (the Nigerian friend) means her comment could have been hurtful to him, even if it was meant as a joke or in a different context.\n\nThe author's reaction was to confront her about the language, which is a reasonable response given the word's history and the presence of a Black individual. The girlfriend's immediate apology suggests she recognized the inappropriateness. However, the author then \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" leading her to cry and accuse him of being a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened, which complicates things.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was being overly controlling or aggressive in his response, that might make him wrong. However, confronting someone about using a racial slur, especially when a person of the targeted race is present, is generally considered the right thing to do. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the primary issue here. The author's approach might have been harsh, but the core issue is her language.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak might imply she felt unfairly targeted, but that doesn't negate the wrongness of using the slur. The author's right to be upset is valid. However, maybe the author could have handled the confrontation more calmly, but that's a separate point from whether he's in the wrong overall. The main issue is the girlfriend's use of the word, so the author's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
