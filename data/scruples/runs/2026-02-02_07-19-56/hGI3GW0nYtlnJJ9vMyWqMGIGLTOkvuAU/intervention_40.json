Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend using the n-word in front of their friends, including a Nigerian one. The author got upset, confronted her, and she ended up crying and yelling that he's a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was upset about getting ticketed for weed and was ranting. She used a racial slur, which is clearly inappropriate. The author felt it was necessary to address it, which is understandable. But he \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might have been too aggressive.\n\nNow, the author's actions: confronting her about the language is valid, but the way he did it led to her crying and a heated argument. The key here is whether his reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend apologized immediately, so maybe she recognized her mistake. The author's approach might have been too harsh, especially since he escalated the situation instead of having a calm discussion. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response suggests she felt controlled rather than supported. The author might not have considered her emotional state at the time. The Nigerian friend confronted her in a joking way, but the author's reaction was more severe. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the initial use of the slur is on the girlfriend. However, the author's handling of the confrontation could be better. Yelling and being hard on her might not be the most effective way to address it. The author's intention was right, but the method could be flawed. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because his approach was too harsh, or B (not in the wrong) because he addressed a serious issue.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. The key is whether the author overreacted. Using the n-word is a serious issue, so addressing it is important. However, the way he did it\u2014yelling, making her cry\u2014could be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A. But some might argue that he wasn't in the wrong because he addressed a harmful statement. Hmm. The line here is between addressing the issue and how it's done. The girlfriend apologized, so maybe the author's reaction was too intense. The answer might be A.\n"
