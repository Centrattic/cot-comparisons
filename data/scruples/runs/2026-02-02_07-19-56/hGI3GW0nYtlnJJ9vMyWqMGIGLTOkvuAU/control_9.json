Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend used the N-word, and he got upset. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The girlfriend made a derogatory comment about people of a certain race, which is a serious issue. The author confronted her, she cried, called him a control freak, and then moved on. \n\nThe user is asking if the author was wrong to react. Well, using a slur is inherently hurtful and offensive, especially in a group that includes a Nigerian friend. The girlfriend's comment was directed at people of color, which is really problematic. The author felt the need to address it because it's a serious issue, and confronting someone about using such a word is understandable. \n\nBut maybe the author's approach was too harsh? He \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which caused her to cry and feel attacked. That could be seen as being overly controlling. However, the key point is that the girlfriend used a racial slur. The author's reaction is about holding her accountable for offensive language, which is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend apologized immediately, which is a good sign. The author's confrontation might have been necessary to address the harmful comment. The fact that she later acted like nothing happened could indicate she didn't take it seriously, but that's her response, not the author's fault.\n\nI think the main issue here is that the author was right to be upset about the slur. Confronting someone for using a racial slur is not controlling; it's standing up against racism. However, the way he handled it might have been too harsh, leading to her emotional reaction. But the core of the problem is the girlfriend's use of the N-word, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer is B, No.\n"
