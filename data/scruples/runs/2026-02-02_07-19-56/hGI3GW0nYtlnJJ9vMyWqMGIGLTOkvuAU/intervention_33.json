Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset with their girlfriend for using the n-word. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend said the n-word, which is a highly offensive racial slur. The context is that she was upset after being ticketed for weed and then a text about police on her floor made her rant. She used the slur in a derogatory way towards people, which is clearly harmful. The author confronted her about it, leading to an argument. The girlfriend then apologized, but later the author \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" causing her to cry and accuse him of being a control freak.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, using the n-word is unacceptable. The author should definitely address it. But how they addressed it\u2014getting angry, yelling, and being confrontational\u2014might have been too harsh. The girlfriend did apologize immediately, indicating she realized her mistake. The author's response could have been more constructive. Yelling and making her cry might have been an overreaction, even if the initial issue was serious. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Confronting her calmly to discuss the impact of her words would be better than yelling. Also, the girlfriend's immediate apology shows she didn't intend to be malicious, but the word itself is still wrong regardless. The author's approach might have invalidated her apology and made her defensive. So, the author's method of confrontation could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), because while the girlfriend's actions were wrong, the author's response was excessive and not constructive.\n"
