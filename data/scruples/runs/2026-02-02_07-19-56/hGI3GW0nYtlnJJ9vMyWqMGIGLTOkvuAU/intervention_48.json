Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (white) is upset at their girlfriend (also white) for using the n-word in front of friends, including a Nigerian person. The girlfriend made a derogatory comment about people who might be smoking weed, implying she would rat them out. The author confronted her, she cried and called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the n-word. It's a deeply offensive and racist term with a history of dehumanization and oppression towards Black people. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean to be racist, using that term is harmful and inappropriate. The fact that she used it in a situation involving weed might touch on stereotypes about Black people and drug use, which is a sensitive and problematic stereotype.\n\nThe author confronted her, which is a valid reaction because the term is hurtful. However, the way he did it might be in question. The girlfriend was already upset about being ticketed for weed, and the author \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which suggests he was harsh or aggressive. Confronting her in the moment is understandable, but maybe he could have approached it with more empathy, considering her emotional state. That could have contributed to her crying and feeling accused.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend used a racist term, which is inexcusable. The author has the right to be upset and to address it. The fact that she apologized immediately is a positive, but the initial use of the term is still wrong. The author's reaction might be seen as justified, but the way he handled it could have been more considerate. However, the main issue is her use of a racist slur, which is a significant problem regardless of the context.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of calling him a control freak might be her deflecting or feeling attacked. But the core issue is her choice of words. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset and addressing it. The girlfriend is the one who made a racist comment. The author's approach could be improved, but the main responsibility lies with her for using such a term. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
