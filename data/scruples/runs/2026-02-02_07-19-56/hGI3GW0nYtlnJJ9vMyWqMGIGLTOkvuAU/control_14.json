Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend using a racial slur in front of their friends, including someone from Nigeria. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had been recently ticketed for weed, which made her upset. She made the comment about ratting out \"[n-words]\" when she smelled weed. The use of the n-word is a serious racial slur with a long history of hurt and oppression. Even if she was angry or stressed, using such a term is problematic, especially in a mixed group.\n\nThe author confronted her, which led to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened. The key here is whether the author was in the wrong for confronting her. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend used a harmful slur, and the author was right to address it. It's important to hold people accountable for using offensive language, especially when it's directed at marginalized groups. The author's approach was to \"lean into her pretty hard,\" which might have been harsh, but the intent was to make her aware of the harm caused. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of confrontation could have been more sensitive. Yelling might have escalated the situation. However, the girlfriend's use of the slur is a significant issue. The friends' reaction (silence and the Nigerian friend's response) indicates that the slur was taken seriously. The girlfriend apologized immediately, which shows she recognized the mistake. The author's concern about her using such language is valid given the context.\n\nThe girlfriend later brushed it off, which might indicate she didn't take the issue as seriously as she should have. The author's reaction, while maybe intense, was in response to a serious racial slur. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the main problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
