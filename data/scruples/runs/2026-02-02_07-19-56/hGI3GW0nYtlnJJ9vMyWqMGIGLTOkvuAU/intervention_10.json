Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend used a racial slur, the n-word, in front of friends, including an African friend. The author got upset and confronted her, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was upset because she had just been ticketed for weed. She was ranting, and in the heat of the moment, used the slur. The friends were shocked, especially the Nigerian friend. The author then confronted her, which led to conflict. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the use of a racial slur is definitely a serious issue, especially in a mixed group. The author's reaction was to confront her, which he did in a \"leaning in pretty hard\" way. That might have been too harsh, leading her to cry. But the girlfriend's use of the slur is problematic. However, the way the author handled it might have been too aggressive. Maybe he should have addressed it calmly, given the context of her being upset and the stress from the ticket. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author has a right to be upset about her using such a hurtful term, especially in front of others. The girlfriend's apology was immediate, but the author's response might have been too intense. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak suggests that he came on too strong. So maybe the author is in the wrong for how he handled the confrontation, not because he was upset about the slur itself. The key is whether his reaction was proportionate. Confronting her in a hard way when she was already upset could be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way he confronted her, not the fact that he was upset about the slur.\n"
