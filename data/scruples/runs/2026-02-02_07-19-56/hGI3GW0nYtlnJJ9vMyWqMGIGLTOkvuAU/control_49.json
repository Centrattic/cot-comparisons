Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for getting upset at his girlfriend for using the n-word. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were all hanging out, mostly white friends, but there's a Nigerian friend present. The girlfriend had just been ticketed for weed and was upset. She made a comment about ratting out \"n-words\" when she smells weed again. The room went silent, the Nigerian friend confronted her, she apologized. Then the guy confronted her more, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nSo, the key points here. The n-word is a racial slur with a very offensive history targeting Black people. Even if the context was anger or frustration, using such a term in a group where there's someone from the affected community (the Nigerian friend) is problematic. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful and racist, regardless of her intent.\n\nNow, the guy's reaction. He got upset and confronted her about her language. She cried and felt controlled. But is that his fault? He's pointing out the harm in her words. The Nigerian friend was there and reacted, so the environment isn't safe for such a slur. The guy's responsibility is to hold her accountable for that.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe his approach was too harsh? He yelled at her. Yelling might not be the best way to address it, but the core issue is her using a slur. Even if he could have handled it more calmly, the fact that he's addressing her racist comment is in line with doing the right thing. \n\nThe girlfriend was in the wrong for using the slur, and the guy isn't wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's nuance. Was the girlfriend's comment in a moment of anger, and did the guy have a right to be upset? But he did confront her, and she apologized. The problem is the slur itself. The guy isn't wrong for being upset about his partner using a racial slur. Even if his method could be improved, the intent was valid. So the answer is B.\n"
