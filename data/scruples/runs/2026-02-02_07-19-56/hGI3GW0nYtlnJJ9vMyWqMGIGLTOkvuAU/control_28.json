Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is white, his girlfriend is also white, and they were with friends, including one African friend. The girlfriend got a ticket for weed earlier, and when the dorm smelled like weed again, she made a comment using the n-word. The room went silent, a Nigerian friend confronted her in a joking way, and she apologized. Then the author confronted her more seriously, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the use of the n-word. That word is historically and currently a racial slur against Black people. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean to be racist, using it is problematic. The author was upset, which is understandable given the context and the presence of their friends. The girlfriend apologized immediately, which is a good step, but the author's reaction led to an argument.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong for getting upset? Well, the n-word is a very serious and offensive term. Confronting the girlfriend about her language, especially after she made a derogatory comment in front of others, is not necessarily wrong. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling at her and making her cry\u2014might be seen as harsh. But considering the severity of the slur, his reaction, while possibly intense, might be justified. The girlfriend's apology is a point in her favor, but the initial use of the slur is significant. The author's concern about her language and the impact on others is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
