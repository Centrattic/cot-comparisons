Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's white, got upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The girlfriend also made a derogatory comment about people who smell weed, which they might associate with Black people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was upset after being ticketed for weed, which might have triggered her. She used a racial slur in a moment of anger. The author confronted her about it, which led to the girlfriend crying and accusing him of being a control freak. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, using the n-word is a serious issue, especially in a group where there's a Black friend present. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as racist and harmful. The author's reaction is to call her out on the language, which is understandable because such language is hurtful and perpetuates racism. But the way he handled it\u2014yelling at her, leaning in hard\u2014might have been too harsh, especially if it made her cry. However, the girlfriend's initial use of the slur is definitely problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to express his discomfort with her language, as it's important to address racism. On the other hand, the girlfriend's apology and the author's response might have been too confrontational. But the core issue is her use of a racial slur. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about that, but maybe the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend made the offensive comment, the author's reaction is justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
