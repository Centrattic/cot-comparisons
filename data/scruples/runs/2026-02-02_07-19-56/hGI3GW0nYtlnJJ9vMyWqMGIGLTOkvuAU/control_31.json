Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given story is in the wrong. The situation is about his girlfriend using the n-word and his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend made a derogatory comment in front of friends, including someone from an African background. The author was upset and confronted her, leading to an argument. The girlfriend apologized immediately after the incident but later acted like nothing happened.\n\nThe key points here are the use of a racial slur and the subsequent confrontation. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a long history of racism and oppression. Even if the girlfriend didn't intend to be racist, using the word is harmful and shows insensitivity. The author's reaction was to confront her about the impact of her words, which is a valid response given the offensiveness of the term.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction to the confrontation\u2014calling the author a control freak and the next day acting like nothing happened\u2014suggests she might be minimizing the severity of her actions. The author is advocating for respectful language, which is right. However, yelling at her might not be the best approach. A calm, constructive discussion could have been more effective. But considering the seriousness of the racial slur, the author had a justified reason to be upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. His main fault could be the way he confronted her (yelling), but his concern about the offensive language is valid. On the other hand, the girlfriend used a harmful term and didn't take responsibility afterward. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up against racism, even if his approach could have been better. So the answer is B (No).\n"
