Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend using the n-word, and then he got upset and confronted her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is a serious issue. The author is white, the girlfriend is white, and there are friends present, one of whom is African. The girlfriend had been recently ticketed for weed, which might have contributed to her stress. She said the slur in a rant, then apologized immediately. The author confronted her, leading to her crying and accusing him of being a control freak.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the use of a racial slur, the immediate apology, the author's reaction, and the girlfriend's response. \n\nRacial slurs are offensive and hurtful, regardless of the intent. Even if someone is upset, using such language is problematic. The author's reaction is about holding her accountable for her words, which is valid because such language can be deeply harmful. However, the way he confronted her (yelling, leading to her crying) might be seen as harsh. But considering the context, his concern is understandable. The girlfriend's apology was immediate, but the fact that she later acted like nothing happened might indicate a lack of full understanding of the issue. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for being upset about her using a racial slur. He's addressing a serious issue that affects others, especially the African friend in the room. His actions, while perhaps intense, are about standing up against offensive language. The girlfriend's response of calling him a control freak might minimize the seriousness of the slur. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
