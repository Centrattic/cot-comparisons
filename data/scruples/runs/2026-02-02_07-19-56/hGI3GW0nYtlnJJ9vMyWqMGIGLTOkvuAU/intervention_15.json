Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend had already been ticketed for weed on campus. When another incident happens, she uses a racial slur, which shocks the room. The author confronts her, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she acts like nothing happened.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The choices are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nHmm. Using the n-word is a very serious issue. It's a racial slur with deep historical and emotional weight, especially targeting Black people. Even if she was upset, using such a term is harmful and offensive. The fact that one of her friends is African adds to the context, making it even more inappropriate. The author is a white person, so the racial slur is directed at a marginalized group, which is particularly problematic.\n\nThe author confronted her, which shows he was addressing a harmful statement. Even if his approach was harsh (yelling, leaning into it hard), the issue itself is valid. It's important to call out racist language, especially in a group setting where it can hurt others. The girlfriend's immediate apology is a good sign, but the fact that she later seems to brush it off by acting like nothing happened is concerning. Maybe she didn't take it seriously enough?\n\nBut wait, the author's response: he \"leaned into her pretty hard\" which might mean he was aggressive or not giving her space to reflect. Confronting someone in an upset manner, especially when they're already emotional, could be seen as harsh. However, the core issue is the use of a racist slur. The girlfriend might not realize how offensive it is, or she might have used it thoughtlessly. As a white person using a racial slur aimed at Black people, that's a problem regardless of intent.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate objectively. The key here is the use of the n-word. It's widely recognized as a derogatory term, and even if someone is upset, using it is wrong. The girlfriend deserves to be held accountable for that. The author's method of confronting her might not have been perfect\u2014maybe he should have stayed calm and discussed it later instead of yelling\u2014but the reaction to the slur is justified.\n\nSo, even if the author's approach could be improved, the fact that he was upset about his girlfriend using such a harmful term isn't something he's in the wrong for. The real issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
