Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend using the n-word in front of friends, including someone African, and then the author confronting her, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is clearly wrong and offensive. The author was upset and addressed it with her when they were alone, leading to an argument where she called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting her. The girlfriend used a racist term, which is harmful. The author's reaction was to call her out on her language, which seems like a reasonable response to address the offensive comment. However, the way he approached it\u2014leaning in hard and yelling\u2014might have been harsh. But given that the term used is extremely offensive, the author's concern is valid. The girlfriend's immediate apology after the Nigerian friend confronted her suggests she realized it was wrong, but then she dismissed it the next day. \n\nThe author's actions were in response to a racist remark, which is a serious issue. Even if his method was confrontational, the intent was to address the wrongdoing. The girlfriend's reaction might be part of a pattern of dismissing such issues, which the author is trying to correct. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's addressing a racial slur, which is important, and his response, while intense, was in reaction to a serious offense. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the main issue here, not the author's valid reaction.\n"
