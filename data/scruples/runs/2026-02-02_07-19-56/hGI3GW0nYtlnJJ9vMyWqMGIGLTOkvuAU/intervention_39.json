Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their girlfriend used the n-word and they got upset. The situation is that the girlfriend made a racist comment in front of friends, including someone of African descent. The author confronted her, leading to her apologizing and then later acting like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a deeply offensive term with a long history of racism and oppression. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean it maliciously in the moment, using such a slur is never acceptable, especially in a mixed group. The author reacting by confronting her is a responsible action because it addresses the offensive language and shows support for their black friend.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been too harsh. Yelling at her and causing her to cry could be seen as overreacting, especially since she apologized immediately. The key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Confronting her about being more careful with her language is valid, but doing so in a way that makes her feel controlled might not be effective. The girlfriend's response as a \"control freak\" might stem from feeling attacked, which is a common reaction when someone is criticized, even if the criticism is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's responsibility as an ally to their black friend is important. By addressing the comment, the author is taking a stand against racism, which is the right thing to do. The fact that the girlfriend later acted like nothing happened suggests she may not take the issue seriously, which could mean the author's initial reaction wasn't strong enough. But the way they handled it, yelling and causing emotional distress, might have been counterproductive.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong for being upset about the racist comment. However, their approach could have been more constructive. Instead of yelling, a calm and firm discussion about the impact of such language would have been better. The girlfriend using the n-word is the main issue, and the author's reaction, while well-intentioned, might have been too harsh. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because confronting the offensive language is justified, even if the method could have been improved.\n"
