Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in front of their friends, including someone from Nigeria. The author was upset and confronted her about it, leading to an argument. The question is whether the author was wrong to react that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a racial slur with a long history of being used to demean and oppress Black people. Even if someone is white and not from the affected community, using such a term is generally considered offensive and inappropriate, especially in mixed company. The girlfriend's use of the word in that context, even if she thought it was a joke or in a moment of frustration, could be hurtful. The fact that there's a Nigerian friend present adds another layer because the term is also used to refer to Black people more broadly.\n\nThe author's reaction: he confronted her about it. He says he \"leaned into her pretty hard\" about being careful with her language. His girlfriend got emotional and called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nNow, the key points here. The n-word is a serious issue. Using it in any context is problematic, regardless of the speaker's race. The author's friends were all white except for one African friend, so the presence of someone who might be directly affected by the slur is important. The girlfriend's initial apology after the friend confronted her shows she recognized it was wrong at least momentarily. Then the author's own confrontation might have been necessary as a partner to address the issue, but maybe his approach was too harsh? Or is it justified to address such a serious slur?\n\nOn one hand, the author is right to be upset about the use of a racial slur, especially in a group that includes someone who might be targeted by that slur. It's important to call out such language. On the other hand, his reaction led to her crying and feeling like he was a control freak. Maybe he could have handled it more gently, or perhaps the girlfriend was defensive because she felt called out for something that's just wrong. \n\nBut the core issue is the use of the slur. The author isn't wrong for being upset about that. If anything, he's right to address it. The girlfriend's use of the term is the main problem here. The author's response, while maybe intense, is a reasonable reaction to someone using such a harmful word. The fact that she apologized immediately but then later dismissed it by acting like nothing happened suggests she might not take the issue as seriously as she should. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. His response was appropriate given the seriousness of the slur. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
