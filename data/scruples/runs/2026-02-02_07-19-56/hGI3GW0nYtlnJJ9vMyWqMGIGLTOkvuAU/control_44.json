Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the person's girlfriend using the n-word and the author reacting by getting upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend said a racial slur, which is clearly offensive. The author was upset and confronted her, leading to an argument. The girlfriend apologized immediately but later acted like nothing happened. The author's friends, including someone African, were there, which adds context about the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend used a racist term, which is unacceptable. The author's reaction seems to be a valid response to her using such a slur, especially in a mixed group. However, the author \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was harsh in his confrontation. The girlfriend's response was to cry and call him a control freak, which suggests the confrontation escalated.\n\nBut the core issue is the use of the n-word by the girlfriend. The author is not wrong for being upset about that. The girlfriend's apology was immediate, but the author's reaction might have been appropriate given the context. The problem might be more on the girlfriend's side for using the slur and not really taking responsibility afterward. The author is trying to address the offensive language, which is right, even if his approach could have been softer. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong here. The wrong was the girlfriend using the slur. The author's response, while maybe intense, is justified in pointing out the inappropriateness of her comment.\n"
