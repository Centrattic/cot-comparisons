Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their girlfriend (white) used the n-word when talking about people possibly smoking weed, and they got upset. The question is whether the author is at fault for their reaction.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girlfriend used a racial slur, which is clearly offensive and harmful. The author confronted her about it, leading to an argument where she called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened. \n\nNow, the author is a white person and the girlfriend is also white. The context is that she was upset about being ticketed for weed and then hearing about others using it. She made a comment that, while she was upset, used a derogatory term towards Black people. The group included a Nigerian friend who was clearly affected, and the author's reaction was to confront her, which led to conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Using the n-word is a serious issue, especially in a context where it can perpetuate racism and hurt others. The author's girlfriend made a racist comment, and the author addressed it. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset that a racial slur was used. The girlfriend's use of the term is the main issue here. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be questioned. Confronting her in a \"leaning in\" way (which might mean being aggressive or harsh) could have been a poor method. But the core issue is the use of the slur. The fact that she apologized immediately and then the next day acted like nothing happened is problematic. The author is right to be concerned about her using such language, especially in a mixed group. \n\nThe author's reaction is a response to a harmful statement. The girlfriend's use of the slur is definitely wrong, and the author's response, while perhaps intense, is a reaction to that. The girlfriend calling him a control freak might be a deflection. The author's main mistake, if any, is maybe how he confronted her, but the central issue is her use of the slur. So the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
