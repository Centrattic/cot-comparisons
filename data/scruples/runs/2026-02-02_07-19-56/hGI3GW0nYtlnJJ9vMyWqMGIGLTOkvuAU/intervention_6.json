Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (who's white) got upset at their girlfriend (also white) for using the n-word around friends, including a Nigerian person. The girlfriend said it in the context of being upset about being ticketed for weed and ranting about people who smoke weed, using the term. The author confronted her, she cried and accused him of being a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nSo, first, I need to evaluate if the author was wrong. Let's break it down. Using the n-word is a severe racial slur with a long history of oppression and hate. Even if the girlfriend was upset, using that term, especially in a group that includes someone from an affected community (the Nigerian friend), is problematic. The author's reaction is understandable because the term is offensive regardless of intent. However, the way the author handled it might be an issue. Yelling at her and making her cry could be seen as harsh, but the situation involves a serious racial slur. The girlfriend's response of calling him a control freak might be deflecting the real issue. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is wrong. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is clearly wrong. The author's concern about the language and its impact is valid, especially with a Nigerian friend present. The author's approach might not have been the best (maybe a calmer discussion would help), but the root of the issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur, not the author's reaction. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate. The user might think the author overreacted, but given the severity of the slur, the author's reaction is justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because confronting the girlfriend's use of a racist term is the right action, even if the method could be improved. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the main problem here.\n"
