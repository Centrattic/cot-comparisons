Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves his girlfriend using the n-word in a group where there are friends, including one African person. The author got upset and confronted her, leading to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is a big deal. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of being used to dehumanize and oppress Black people. Even if it was a slip or said in a moment of anger, the impact is significant. The fact that there was a Black person present (the Nigerian friend) makes the situation more sensitive. The author's reaction seems to be about addressing the harmful language and its potential impact on others, especially in their diverse group of friends.\n\nThe girlfriend apologized immediately when confronted by the friend, but then the author continued to \"lean into her pretty hard\" when they were alone. Maybe he was being too harsh in his confrontation. However, the issue is that using such a slur is wrong regardless of the context. The author was right to be upset about her using that term, especially in front of others. The girlfriend's response of calling him a control freak might be a deflection. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? If he confronted her in a calm, constructive way, that's one thing. But if he yelled at her, that's another. The line says he \"yelled at her,\" which might have been an overreaction. However, the core issue is her use of the slur. The author's concern is valid, but the way he handled it might have been problematic. So it's a bit of a balance. The question is whether his reaction, while perhaps excessive in tone, was justified given the offensive nature of her statement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main wrong here is the girlfriend's use of the slur. The author's reaction, while maybe harsh, is in response to that. So the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong)."
