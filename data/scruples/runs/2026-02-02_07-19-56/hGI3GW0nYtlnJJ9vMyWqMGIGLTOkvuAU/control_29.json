Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the scenario they described. The situation involves the girlfriend using the n-word in front of friends, including someone from Nigeria. The author got upset and confronted her, leading to an argument. The girlfriend cried and called him a control freak, but the next day she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is white, the girlfriend is white too. They were with friends, including one African. The girlfriend said the n-word in a derogatory way after being upset about a weed incident. The room went silent, a Nigerian friend confronted her jokingly. The author then confronted her seriously, leading to the argument.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was in the wrong for reacting to her use of a racist slur. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of being used to dehumanize Black people. Even if the girlfriend was upset, using such a term is problematic, especially in a mixed group where someone might be offended.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as justified because he's holding her accountable for using a hurtful term. However, his approach of \"leaning into her pretty hard\" might have been confrontational. Maybe he could have handled it more calmly, but the fact that he addressed it shows he cares about her language's impact.\n\nThe girlfriend apologizing immediately is a positive sign, but the author's response escalating to yelling and her feeling controlled complicates things. However, using the n-word is inherently wrong regardless of intent. The author's stance against it is valid, but the method of confrontation might have been harsh. Still, the core issue is her use of the slur, which is the main wrong here. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
