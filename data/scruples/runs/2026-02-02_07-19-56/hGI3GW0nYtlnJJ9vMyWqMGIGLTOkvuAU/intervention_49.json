Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The situation is that the girlfriend made a racist comment in front of friends, including someone from Nigeria. The author confronted her, she apologized, then later he leaned into it more, leading to an argument where she felt controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend used a highly offensive racial slur, which is clearly wrong. Using the n-word is a serious issue, especially in a context where there are black individuals present. The author was right to be upset because such language is hurtful and perpetuates racism. However, the way he handled the confrontation might be problematic. He yelled at her, which could be seen as aggressive, especially after she had already apologized. Then, when she was emotional and upset, he kept pushing, leading to her feeling controlled. That's where the author might have gone too far. \n\nThe key points here are the initial offense (using the n-word) and the response. While the use of the slur is inexcusable, the author's method of confrontation could have been more constructive. Yelling and then continuing to pressure her when she was already remorseful might have made her feel attacked rather than understood. Healthy communication in relationships requires both accountability and empathy. The author's actions suggest a lack of emotional regulation and possibly an overreaction, which could be seen as controlling, as the girlfriend accused him of being. \n\nSo, even though the girlfriend's initial action was wrong, the author's approach in dealing with it may have exacerbated the situation. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for the way he handled the confrontation, even if the girlfriend's use of the slur was clearly wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his response was excessive and contributed to the conflict.\n"
