Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The situation involves a group of friends, mostly white except one African friend, who are watching TV. The girlfriend, already upset because she was recently ticketed for weed, receives a text about her dorm smelling like weed. She then says she'd \"rat out those [n-words].\" The room goes silent, a Nigerian friend confronts her, and she apologizes. The author then confronts her, leading to an argument where she calls him a control freak. The next day, she acts like nothing happened.\n\nSo, the key points here are the use of a racial slur and the author's reaction. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of racism and discrimination. Even if it's used in a different context, the term itself is problematic. The girlfriend's use of it in front of friends, especially when there's a person of African descent present, is inappropriate. The author's response was to confront her, which led to her crying and the argument.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend made a racist remark, which is clearly wrong. The author's reaction was to address it, which seems justified. However, the way he did it\u2014yelling at her and making her feel controlled\u2014might be where he goes wrong. Maybe he could have handled it with more calmness and dialogue rather than confrontation. But considering the severity of the slur, it's understandable he was upset. On the other hand, the girlfriend dismissed the issue the next day, which might indicate she didn't take it seriously, but her immediate apology suggests she recognized the mistake.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if his reaction was appropriate. Confronting someone about using a racial slur is important, but the method (yelling, being controlling) could be problematic. However, given the context of the slur's severity, the author's anger is understandable. The girlfriend's use of the term is clearly the bigger issue here. So, while the author's approach could have been better, is he in the wrong overall? Maybe not, because the primary fault is the girlfriend's. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
