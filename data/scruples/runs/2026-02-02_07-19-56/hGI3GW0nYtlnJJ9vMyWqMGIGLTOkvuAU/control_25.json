Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The situation is that they were all hanging out with friends, including one African friend. The girlfriend had been ticketed for weed earlier, got a text about the smell, and then made a comment using the n-word. The room went silent, a Nigerian friend confronted her, she apologized, and then the author talked to her more seriously. She got upset, called him a control freak, and the next day acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, the n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of racial slur and hatred. Even if the girlfriend didn't intend it maliciously, using such a word in any context is problematic. The author's reaction is to be upset and confront her about it. But the girlfriend feels controlled and maybe overreacts. The key points here are the intent, the context, and the impact.\n\nThe girlfriend's intent might have been to express frustration about the weed situation, but using that word was a poor choice. The presence of a Nigerian friend makes it even more sensitive because the term can dehumanize people of African descent. The author's role in addressing it is important. He might be right to be upset because the word is harmful, but his approach\u2014yelling and being hard on her\u2014could be seen as aggressive. However, even if he handled it poorly, the initial use of the slur was wrong. The girlfriend apologizing immediately is a good sign, but the next day acting like nothing happened might indicate she isn't fully acknowledging the issue. \n\nThe author's actions were to address the offensive language, which is a valid concern. But the way he leaned into her pretty hard might have been too harsh, leading to her emotional reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the problem is the girlfriend using the n-word, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, if his approach was too controlling, maybe. But the n-word is a serious issue. The girlfriend's subsequent behavior (calling him a control freak and then acting normal) suggests she might not take the issue seriously, which could mean the author was right to address it. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No), because the girlfriend used a racist term, and the author is correct to address that. The girlfriend's reaction might be part of the problem, but the author isn't wrong for being upset.\n"
