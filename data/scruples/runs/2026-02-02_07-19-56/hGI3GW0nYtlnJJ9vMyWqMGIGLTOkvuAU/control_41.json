Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset when their girlfriend used the N-word. So, first, I need to recall the context given. The girlfriend said the N-word in a group that included a Nigerian friend. The author confronted her, she cried and called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the use of a racial slur. The N-word is a highly offensive term with a history of racism and oppression. Even if she was upset or angry, using such a term in a mixed group is problematic. The author's reaction is about calling her out for using that word, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's use of the term could be hurtful, especially in front of someone from the affected community. \n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend was using it as a term of endearment among friends? Sometimes people from certain communities use it differently, but since she's white and not part of the community that uses it in that way, that's unlikely. So using it in that context is inappropriate and offensive. \n\nThe author is upset because she used a slur, which is right to be upset about. He confronted her, which led to her crying and labeling him a control freak. But is his reaction justified? Confronting someone for using offensive language is a responsible action. However, he might have handled it in a way that was too harsh, leading to her emotional reaction. But given the context, the word itself is the main issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's apology immediately after suggests she realized the mistake. The next day, she acting like nothing happened might indicate she downplayed the situation, but the author's initial reaction was to address the harmful language. So in terms of right and wrong, the author is not in the wrong for being upset because her use of the N-word was offensive. The girlfriend is in the wrong for using that term. The author's response was appropriate in pointing out the inappropriateness. Even if the confrontation was intense, the core issue is her use of a slur. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
