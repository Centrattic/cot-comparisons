Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend used a racial slur, which is clearly offensive. But then the author reacted by \"leaning into her pretty hard,\" leading to her crying and calling him a control freak. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, using a racial slur is never acceptable, especially in a group that includes people who might be affected by that term, like the African friend mentioned. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful and showed prejudice, which the author rightfully addressed. However, the way the author handled it could be problematic. Yelling at her after she apologized might have been too harsh, especially if she was already upset. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt attacked, leading to the argument.\n\nBut the key point here is the use of a racial slur. Even if the author's approach was overly aggressive, the initial wrongdoing was hers. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about a racist remark. However, his method of addressing it could have been more constructive. The question is whether his anger and the subsequent argument made him at fault. Since the main issue was her use of the slur, the author's reaction, while perhaps too intense, stems from a valid concern. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, even if his approach was flawed.\n"
