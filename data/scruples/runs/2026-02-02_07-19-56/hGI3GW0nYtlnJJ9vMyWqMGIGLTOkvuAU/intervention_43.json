Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me parse through the details.\n\nThe author (white) and his girlfriend (also white) were with friends, including one African person. The girlfriend got upset because she had just been ticketed for weed. When they got a text about someone else smoking weed on the floor, she said she'd \"rat out those [n-words].\" The room went silent, a Nigerian friend confronted her jokingly, she apologized. Then when alone, the author confronted her hard, she cried and called him a control freak. The next day, she acted like it never happened.\n\nFirst, the use of the n-word is inherently offensive and racist. Even if she was angry, using such a derogatory term is unacceptable, especially in a group that includes a Black person. The author was right to be upset and to address it. However, his approach was to \"lean into her pretty hard,\" which led to her crying and feeling controlled. The girlfriend's immediate apology suggests she realized her mistake. But the author's reaction might have been too harsh, even if the content was wrong. The key points are: her use of a racist slur is wrong, his reaction was strong but perhaps not the best way to handle it. However, the main issue is her racism, so the author's response, while intense, is condemning the right behavior. The girlfriend's later behavior (talking like nothing happened) is problematic too. The author is not in the wrong for confronting her about using the slur, even if his tone could be improved. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset. Since the slur is wrong, and the author addressed it, answer is B. But wait, the girlfriend apologized, maybe the author was right to be upset. The friends' silence and the Nigerian friend's reaction also indicate that her use of the word was inappropriate. So the author's reaction was justified. However, the way he handled it might be seen as controlling, but the core issue is the racist comment. The author is not in the wrong because the slur is wrong. So B.\n"
