Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset when their girlfriend used the n-word. Let me start by recalling the context they provided.\n\nThe author is white, his girlfriend is white, and they were with friends, including one African friend. The girlfriend had just been ticketed for weed on campus earlier that day. When she got a text about someone else's weed smell, she got upset and said she would \"rat those [n-words] out.\" The room went silent, a Nigerian friend confronted her jokingly, she apologized, and then the author later confronted her, leading to her crying and labeling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the n-word. That word is a slur with a long history of being used to demean and oppress Black people. Even if someone isn't using it in a malicious way, using it in any context can be hurtful and offensive. The girlfriend's statement was directed at people who might be smoking weed, implying that she would report them based on their race. That's not just using a slur; it's making a threat based on race, which adds another layer of severity.\n\nThe author's reaction was to confront her about being careful with her language. He probably felt that using such a derogatory term was wrong, especially around their friends, including the African friend. The girlfriend's immediate apology suggests she realized her mistake. However, the author's approach might have been too harsh. Yelling at her could have made her defensive, leading to her emotional response and the accusation of being a control freak.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being upset? On one hand, using the n-word is clearly wrong, and the author had a right to be upset about that. On the other hand, how he handled the situation might not have been the best approach. Instead of confronting her harshly later, maybe a more calm and supportive discussion could have worked better. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's use of a racial slur, which is not acceptable regardless of the author's approach. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of crying and calling him a control freak might be a defense mechanism, but that doesn't excuse her use of the slur. The author's concern about her language being hurtful is valid. In this case, even if his method could be improved, the fact that she used a racist term makes him not entirely at fault. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), because using the n-word is wrong, and being upset about that is justified. However, the way he handled the confrontation could be critiqued, but the main wrongdoing here is the girlfriend's use of the slur.\n"
