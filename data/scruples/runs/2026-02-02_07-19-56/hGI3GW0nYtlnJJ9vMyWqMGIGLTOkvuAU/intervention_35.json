Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in front of their friends, including a Nigerian guy. The author got upset and confronted her, leading to an argument where she called him a control freak. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend was upset about being ticketed for weed, and she made a derogatory comment. Using the n-word is a serious issue because it's a racist slur, even if it's used by someone who is the same race as the person it's directed at. The author's reaction is about holding her accountable for that language, especially since there's a Black friend present.\n\nBut how to handle it? The author confronted her \"pretty hard,\" which might have been harsh. She apologized immediately, so maybe she realized her mistake. The author's approach might have been too aggressive, leading her to feel attacked. Maybe he should have addressed it calmly, explaining why the term is offensive. Instead, yelling could have escalated the situation, making her defensive and leading to the argument. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to be upset about racist language in their presence, especially when it affects a friend. The girlfriend's use of the term is problematic regardless of her intent. The author's intentions were to correct her, but the method might have been the issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's possible that while his intent was right, his approach was too harsh, leading to a negative reaction. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. However, considering that the girlfriend apologized right away, maybe the author's strong reaction was unnecessary. But given the offensiveness of the term, the author's response is understandable. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because he's addressing a serious issue, but his method could have been better. However, given the context, the main issue is the use of the slur, so his reaction is justified even if his approach could be improved. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
