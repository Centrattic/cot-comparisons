Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend said the n-word in front of their friends, which included someone of African descent. The author confronted her, she apologized but then when alone, he \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" leading to her crying and accusing him of being a control freak. The next day, she acted like nothing happened.\n\nSo, the key points are: using a racial slur, confronting her, emotional response, and the aftermath. \n\nThe n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of racial oppression. Even if it was a slip or in a specific context, using it is wrong and harmful. The girlfriend apologized immediately, which shows she realized her mistake. The author's reaction was to \"yell at her\" and \"monitor her language,\" which could be seen as valid because the term is offensive, but his approach might have been too harsh, leading to her emotional response. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, using the n-word is clearly wrong, and the author had the right to be upset. However, how he handled it might have been part of the problem. Yelling and being confrontational could have made her defensive instead of constructive. But the main issue is her use of the slur, which is definitely wrong. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nWait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think that the girlfriend's use of the term was a mistake, but the author overreacted. But is the author in the wrong for standing up about a racial slur? Or is he just handling the confrontation poorly? \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether confronting her about the slur is justified. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about the racial slur. However, his approach of yelling and possibly being a bit controlling in how he addressed it might have been counterproductive. But the core issue is the use of the slur, which is wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the way he handled it could be improved. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in general. \n\nGiven that using the n-word is wrong, and the author had the right to address it, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Maybe some would argue that the girlfriend's use of the term was a mistake, and the author overreacted. But the term itself is so offensive that confronting her is necessary. So the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong for being upset and addressing the use of the slur, even if the approach could have been better. The main issue is the girlfriend's use of the word, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
