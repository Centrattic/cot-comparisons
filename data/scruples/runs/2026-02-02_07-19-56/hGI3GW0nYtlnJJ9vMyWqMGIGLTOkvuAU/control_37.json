Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend, who is white, used the n-word in front of friends, including someone from Africa. The author was upset and confronted her, which led to her crying and calling him a control freak. The next day, she seemed to brush it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a highly offensive racial slur with a long history of being used to dehumanize Black people. Even if the girlfriend was upset and in a moment of anger, using that word is problematic, especially around people from the affected community. The author's reaction seems to be about calling her out on using offensive language, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut was his approach wrong? He \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was confrontational. Confronting someone about offensive language is important, but the method matters. If he was yelling at her or being overly aggressive, that could be seen as controlling. However, the girlfriend's immediate apology suggests she recognized the inappropriateness. Then, when alone, he continued the confrontation, leading to her crying and accusations of being a control freak. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The use of the slur was wrong regardless of intent. 2) The author's right to be upset and address it. 3) The way he addressed it\u2014was it justified or excessive? \n\nIf the author calmly discussed the issue, that's one thing, but if he was yelling, that could be seen as aggressive. The girlfriend's reaction (crying, calling him a control freak) might indicate that his approach was too harsh. However, it's also possible that he was right to address the offensive language, and her defensiveness is a separate issue. \n\nThe next day, she acted like nothing happened, which could imply she didn't take the issue seriously, but that's more about her response than his initial action. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author was trying to correct offensive behavior, he's not wrong for being upset. However, the method of confrontation might have been too harsh, leading to the girlfriend feeling controlled. The question is whether his approach was wrong. If the answer is about whether he was in the wrong for being upset and confronting her, then maybe not. But if the way he confronted her was overly controlling, then he might be at fault. \n\nI think the main issue is the girlfriend using the slur, which is clearly wrong. The author's reaction is about addressing that, which is right. However, if he was aggressive in his approach, that's where he might be in the wrong. The line between standing up for social justice and being controlling can be thin. Given that she apologized immediately, maybe the author's continued confrontation after the apology was excessive. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong for being upset and addressing the offensive language, but his method of confrontation might have been too harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. If the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), then considering that the main issue was the girlfriend's use of the slur, and the author's right to address it, the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
