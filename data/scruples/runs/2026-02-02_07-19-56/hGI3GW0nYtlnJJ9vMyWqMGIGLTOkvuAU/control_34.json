Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in a group of friends, and the author got upset, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of being used to dehumanize Black people. Even if the girlfriend said it in a moment of frustration, the word itself is deeply hurtful and perpetuates racism. The author was right to be upset because using such a term is unacceptable, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends, including a Nigerian individual, were present. The Nigerian friend reacted, which shows that the use of the word was noticed and likely upsetting to others. The author confronting her about it is a valid response, as it's important to address harmful language, especially in a diverse group.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been heavy-handed. Yelling at her and making her cry could have been too aggressive. While the content of what she said was wrong, the way the author handled it might have contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak suggests that the confrontation was emotionally charged and possibly not handled with the right tone.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and addressing the offensive language. However, the method of confrontation could have been improved. The main issue is the use of the n-word, which is clearly wrong. The author's response might have been too harsh, but the core of his concern is valid. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the primary issue is the girlfriend's use of the offensive term, and the author had a right to be upset about that. The problem lies more with her choice of words than with his reaction, even if his approach could have been more measured.\n"
