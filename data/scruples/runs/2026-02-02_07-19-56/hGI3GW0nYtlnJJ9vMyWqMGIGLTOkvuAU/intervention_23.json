Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend using the n-word around friends, including a Nigerian person, and then he got upset and confronted her. She apologized but then later he \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which led to her crying and calling him a control freak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The n-word is a highly offensive term with a history of racial slur use against Black people. The girlfriend used it in a group where there's a Nigerian friend present. Even if she wasn't directly referring to him, the term is still deeply hurtful. The author was upset and confronted her, which is understandable given the slur's offensive nature. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. The girlfriend apologized immediately after being confronted by her friend, which is a good sign. Then, when they were alone, the author \"leaned into her pretty hard.\" The term \"lean into\" might mean he was confrontational or overly critical. The girlfriend then cried and accused him of being a control freak. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) was the author right to be upset about the n-word? 2) Was his reaction (yelling, confronting her hard) inappropriate? \n\nUsing the n-word is wrong, so the author had a valid reason to be upset. However, his approach might have been too harsh. Confronting someone in a way that makes them cry and feel controlled might be excessive, even if the initial offense is serious. The girlfriend did apologize, so maybe the author could have acknowledged the apology and discussed it calmly instead of escalating the situation. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend later acted like nothing happened the next day, which might indicate she didn't fully grasp the severity, but the author's reaction could have contributed to the tension. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he was right to be upset about the slur, but his method of addressing it might have been too harsh. However, the girlfriend using the n-word is a significant issue. The answer might depend on whether the reaction was proportionate. If he was yelling and being overbearing, maybe he's part of the problem. But if he was just expressing his hurt and concern, then perhaps not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of social norms, using the n-word is clearly wrong, so the author's upset is justified. However, how he handled it might not have been the best approach. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes, he's wrong), that would be if his reaction was inappropriate. If B (No), then if his reaction was justified despite the approach. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because using the n-word is a major issue, and the author had a right to be upset. However, his method of confrontation might have been too harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. The girlfriend's use of the slur is the main problem here. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and trying to address it, even if the approach could be better. So the answer would be B.\n"
