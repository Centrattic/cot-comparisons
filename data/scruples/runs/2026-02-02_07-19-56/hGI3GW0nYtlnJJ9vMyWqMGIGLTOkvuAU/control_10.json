Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in a conversation, and the author got upset. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend was upset because she had been ticketed for weed and then heard about police on campus. She made a comment about ratting out people she called n-words. The room was mostly white except one African friend. When the friend confronted her in a joking way, she apologized. Then the author talked to her seriously, she got emotional, called him a control freak, and later seemed to move on.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for getting upset. Let's break it down. The use of a racial slur is a big issue. Even if the context was her being angry about weed issues, using such a term is offensive and harmful. The author was right to address it because it's about respecting others and not perpetuating racism. However, his approach\u2014yelling at her and confronting her hard\u2014might have been too harsh, especially if he didn't give her space to explain or if he was aggressive. But considering the severity of the slur, it's understandable he was upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend apologized immediately, and the next day things seemed to go back to normal. Maybe she didn't realize the gravity of her words, or maybe she did, but the author's reaction was overly controlling. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The slur is a serious issue, so holding her accountable is important. However, yelling and making her cry could be seen as harsh, which might have been unnecessary if she was already remorseful.\n\nBut in this case, the author is standing up against racism, which is a positive action. The girlfriend's use of the term is the real problem. The author's response was to address the offensive language, which is a valid concern. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how he handled it. If he was abusive or overly controlling, that's different. But the scenario says he \"leaned into her pretty hard,\" which might mean he was confrontational but not abusive. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him a control freak might be her way of deflecting or feeling defensive.\n\nSo, considering that the author is addressing a serious racial slur and the girlfriend's use of the term is the main issue, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. His approach might have been too harsh, but his intent was to correct harmful language.\n"
