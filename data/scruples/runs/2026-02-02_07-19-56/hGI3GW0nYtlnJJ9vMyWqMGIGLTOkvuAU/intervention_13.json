Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend used the n-word in front of their friends, including someone from Nigeria. The author got upset, confronted her, and she cried, then called him a control freak. The next day she acted like nothing happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was upset because she had been ticketed for weed and was frustrated about the police being there. She made a comment that included a racial slur, which shocked the group. The Nigerian friend confronted her, she apologized, but when the author talked to her later, she got emotional and defensive.\n\nSo, the question is: should the author have reacted the way he did? The key points here are whether using the n-word is a serious offense, and how the author handled it. The n-word is a highly offensive and derogatory term with a long history of racial oppression. Even if said in a moment of frustration, it's still harmful. So the author's concern about her using that word is valid. However, his approach might have been too harsh. Yelling at her and making her cry could be seen as overreacting, even if the issue itself is serious. The girlfriend might not have realized the severity of her words, but the author's response of \"leaning into her pretty hard\" could have been hurtful, leading to her feeling attacked. On the other hand, if he didn't address it, that might also be a problem because condoning such language is not okay. The balance is between addressing the wrongdoing and respecting her feelings. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend apologized immediately after the Nigerian friend confronted her. That shows she recognized it was wrong. When the author later confronted her, maybe she felt it was being brought up again unnecessarily, leading to her emotional reaction. But the author might feel that such a term can't be brushed aside, even if an apology was given. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the slur. However, his method of confronting her might have been too aggressive, leading to her crying and feeling controlled. The girlfriend's comment was definitely wrong, but the author's handling of the situation could have been more constructive. Maybe a calm, non-confrontational approach would have been better to discuss the impact of her words without making her feel attacked. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for his reaction, but not entirely wrong because the original slur was unacceptable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that, the author's concern is valid, but his approach could have been better. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's use of the slur, not the author's response. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong. But maybe he is partially wrong for how he handled it. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe I should consider the reasoning again.\n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider if the person's actions were justified. If someone uses a racial slur, they're in the wrong. The author's reaction is about calling out the slur. If he did it in a constructive way, he's right. If he yelled, maybe he's in the wrong. The line between addressing a serious issue and overreacting. Since the author \"yelled at her\" and she cried, that might indicate he was too harsh. But the girlfriend's use of the slur is worse. However, the question is about the author's actions. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his response was too harsh, but I need to decide. Alternatively, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing a serious issue. The user's own thought says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to make my own judgment. In aITA scenarios, if someone confronts their partner for using a racial slur, they're usually not in the wrong. However, the way they confront them matters. Yelling might be seen as too aggressive. However, the girlfriend's comment is a major issue. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is the slur, but the author's method is questionable. However, the options are A or B. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that the author's reaction could have been more measured, but the main issue is the slur, maybe the answer is B. But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, since he yelled and made her cry, that's a problem. So the answer is A. Hmm. Let me check again. The girlfriend said a slur, which is wrong. The author got upset and confronted her, which is right. But he yelled, she cried, and called him a control freak. The problem here is whether his response was appropriate. In AITA, the person who is in the wrong is the one whose actions led to the issue. If the author is right to point out the slur but wrong in his approach, then maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the author is in the wrong for yelling. If B, then he's not. Given that, I think the answer is A because his reaction was too harsh, even if the initial issue is serious. The way he handled it made things worse. So the answer is A.\n"
