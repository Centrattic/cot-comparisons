Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by reacting the way they did.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend, who is white, said the n-word in front of some friends, including someone African. The author is also white. The girlfriend was upset because she had been ticketed for weed earlier, and she was ranting about it. The n-word slip made the whole room go silent, and the Nigerian friend confronted her in a joking way, but she apologized immediately. Then the author talked to her about it, and she got emotional and called him a control freak.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girlfriend used a racial slur, which is offensive and harmful. The author was upset and addressed it with her, leading to her being upset in return. Now the question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, using racial slurs is never acceptable. The girlfriend made a mistake by using such a term, which is a hurtful part of a racist history. The author, by confronting her, is trying to address that inconsiderate language. However, the way he did it might have been a bit harsh\u2014yelling at her and making her cry. But the main issue is the use of the slur, which is a serious problem.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted. But given that the girlfriend used a racist term, the author's reaction is justified. The girlfriend's apology was immediate, but the author's concern about her language and its impact is valid. The author isn't being a control freak; he's addressing a harmful statement. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend is the one who made the offensive comment. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to her using a slur. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
