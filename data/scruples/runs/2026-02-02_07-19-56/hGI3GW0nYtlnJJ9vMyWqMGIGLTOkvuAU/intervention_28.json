Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is white, upset at their girlfriend for using the n-word around friends, including someone African. The girlfriend said it in a rant after being ticketed for weed, and then apologized. The author confronted her, she cried, and now the next day she's acting like it didn't happen.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend used a racial slur, which is inherently offensive. The author was upset and confronted her, leading to an argument. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong to be upset. Well, the girlfriend's use of the n-word is problematic. Even if it was a slip or in a moment of anger, using such a term is harmful and perpetuates racism. The author's reaction\u2014getting upset and confronting her\u2014is a reasonable response to her using such a slur. However, the way the author handled it might be an issue. Yelling at her and making her cry could be seen as harsh, but given the severity of the term used, the author's concern is valid.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend apologized immediately, so maybe the author's reaction was too intense. Also, the fact that she later acted like it didn't happen might indicate she doesn't take it seriously. However, the initial use of the slur is a major issue. The author's right to be upset is justified because the term is extremely offensive and hurtful. The girlfriend's deflection by calling the author a control freak might be a way to avoid accountability.\n\nSo, while the author's method of confronting her could have been more constructive, their anger at the use of the slur is understandable and justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
