He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who moved their partner's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation is that they just moved in together, and the BF has a big collection. The author isn't into Star Trek, tried watching shows but didn't get it. They moved the toys to the basement because they wanted to have a say in the bedroom's decoration. The BF got upset and threatened to damage the toys.\n\nHmm, so the author's reasoning is that since they're paying half the rent, they should have equal say in how the shared space is set up. On the other hand, the BF's collection is personal, and moving someone's belongings without their consent could be seen as overstepping. But the author did leave some items like posters and a cloth symbol up, so maybe they tried to find a middle ground. The BF's reaction might be childish, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. \n\nI think it's a matter of communication. The author didn't discuss moving the toys first, which might have been a better approach. Even if they're sharing the space, taking someone else's possessions without talking about it could be disrespectful. The BF's threat to damage the toys is also problematic, but the initial action of moving the toys might have been a misstep. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not discussing it first, but maybe they have valid reasons too. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer could lean towards A (yes) because they moved the items without consent, even if the BF's reaction was over the top.\n"
