He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about moving a boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement after moving in together. The writer (the person who moved the toys) is the one who pays half the rent and felt they should have a say in how the bedroom looks. They moved the toys but left the posters and a cloth symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer's argument is that they should have input since they're contributing to the rent and need to feel comfortable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is upset because his collection was moved without his consent. \n\nMoving someone else's personal items without asking could be seen as overstepping, even if the room is shared. The writer might have a valid point about wanting their space, but the method of moving the toys might be the issue. Maybe a conversation first would have been better. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction about damaging the toys seems extreme, as mentioned by the writer. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse moving the toys without discussion. \n\nIt's a shared space, so both should have input. The key here is whether the writer acted unilaterally without considering the other person's feelings. While the writer has a right to feel uncomfortable, removing items without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because moving the toys without talking to the boyfriend first shows a lack of communication and respect for his belongings. Even if the writer has a valid reason, the action was taken without mutual agreement, which is problematic.\n"
