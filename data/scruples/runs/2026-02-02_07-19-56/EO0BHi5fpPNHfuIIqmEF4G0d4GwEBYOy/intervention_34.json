He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for moving their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement.\n\nFirst, the key points: The couple just moved in together. The boyfriend has a large Star Trek collection in the bedroom. The author isn't into it, tried watching the shows, but doesn't get it. They moved the toys to the basement, left posters and some other items. The boyfriend got upset, mentioned damaging his toys. The author feels they should have a say since they're splitting rent.\n\nHmm. So, when roommates or partners move in together, shared spaces require compromise. The bedroom is a shared space, so both should have input. The author's reasoning is about comfort and equal say. But moving someone else's belongings without discussion could be seen as overstepping. Even if they're paying rent, it's about respecting each other's possessions and preferences. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be immature, but the author's action wasn't discussed with him first. Maybe a better approach would be talking about the room's layout and finding a middle ground, like designating a space for the collection. The author's action was unilateral, which could cause conflict. So, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating first. But maybe they have a valid point about their own comfort. It's a balance between respecting each other's space and belongings. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because moving someone's stuff without discussion is disrespectful. Even if they have their own reasons, communication is key in such situations.\n"
