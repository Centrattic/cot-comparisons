He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for moving their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement. The situation is that they just moved in together, and the author isn't into Star Trek. They moved the toys to the basement, which upset the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions they tried to watch the shows with him but didn't get into it. That's a good step, but maybe they didn't discuss their discomfort with the bedroom's current state? If they didn't talk about it first, moving the toys without discussing could be seen as a problem. Taking action without discussing might come off as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nAlso, the bedroom is a shared space, so both partners should have input. The author has a right to feel comfortable, but so does the boyfriend with his collection. Maybe a compromise could have been made, like moving some items but not all, or finding another storage solution. The author decided to move all the toys, which might have been too abrupt. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author's action could have been handled better through communication and negotiation.\n\nLeaving the posters and the cloth symbol might show the author tried to leave some of his stuff up, but moving the toys entirely to the basement might take away his sense of ownership over the space. Maybe the author should have asked first or at least discussed it. Taking unilateral action can lead to conflict even if the intention was to create a shared space. So, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing it beforehand.\n"
