He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who moved their boyfriend's toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation involves two people moving in together. The boyfriend has a large Star Trek collection in his bedroom. The author, who isn't into it, moved the toys to the basement after paying half the rent and wanting some say in the bedroom's decoration. The boyfriend got upset, even threatening to damage the toys.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author didn't discuss moving the toys first. Maybe they should have talked about it. But on the other hand, when you move in together, both people have a right to feel comfortable. The bedroom is a shared space, so both should have input. However, moving someone else's stuff without discussing it can be seen as disrespectful. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but his collection is part of his identity. Threats to damage the toys are definitely not okay, but the initial action of moving them without consent could be problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating, but the boyfriend's reaction is also extreme. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they acted without discussing, maybe A is the answer.\n"
