He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together. The boyfriend has a big Star Trek collection in his bedroom. The author isn't into it and tried but doesn't get into it. Now that they're sharing the bedroom, the author moved the toys to the basement to have a say in the room's decoration. The BF got upset and mentioned damaging his toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider communication. The author didn't discuss moving the toys first. Maybe they should have talked about it before taking action. In a relationship, especially when sharing a space, discussing boundaries is important. Moving someone's belongings without talking could be seen as dismissive or not respecting their things. Even if the author has a valid point about wanting comfort, the approach might be the issue.\n\nAlso, the BF's reaction seems extreme, but maybe he's passionate about his collection. The author moving the toys without consent might have been a shock. Even if the author is paying rent, that doesn't mean they can unilaterally decide the room's decor without input from the other person. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel uncomfortable. If the room is shared, there should be a compromise. Maybe instead of moving the toys, they could have found a middle ground, like finding a storage solution or a different area. \n\nSo, the key points are: lack of communication, not considering the BF's feelings about his collection, and taking action without discussion. Even if the intention was to have a say, the method could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate first. So the answer would be A.\n"
