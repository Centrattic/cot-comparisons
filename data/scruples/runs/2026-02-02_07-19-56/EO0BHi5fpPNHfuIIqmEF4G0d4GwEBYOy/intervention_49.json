He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple who just moved in together. The author (assuming it's the person posting the question) is the one who moved their partner's Star Trek toys to the basement. The key points here are about shared space, mutual respect, and communication.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they don't like the toys and aren't into Star Trek, even after trying. They feel entitled to have a say in the bedroom's decoration since they're paying rent. Moving the toys without discussing it first could be seen as a lack of communication. Even if the author has valid reasons for wanting their space, taking unilateral action might have been a mistake. \n\nThe boyfriend got upset, which the author found ridiculous. But his reaction might stem from feeling his belongings were disrespected. The bedroom is a shared space, so both partners should have a say, but there's a balance between personal preferences and respecting each other's stuff. The author's action was a significant change without prior discussion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in wanting to feel comfortable in their own home. However, the right approach would have been to talk to their partner first, find a compromise, maybe designate a space for the toys instead of moving them all. The fact that the author moved the items without discussing could be seen as overstepping, even if the intention was to create a comfortable environment. \n\nThe boyfriend's threat to damage his toys is concerning, but that doesn't justify the author's action. Still, the initial move (moving the toys) without communication is likely where the author went wrong. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate first and acted unilaterally, which is a breach of mutual respect in shared living situations.\n"
