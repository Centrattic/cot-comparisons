He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving their BF's Star Trek toys to the basement. The situation is they moved in together, the BF has a lot of toys in the bedroom. The author tried to like it but just can't, and since they're paying rent, they moved the toys to the basement. The BF got upset and threatened to damage the toys.\n\nHmm. So the key points here. The author moved in together, so both have a say in how the shared space is decorated. The BF's toys are in the bedroom, which is a shared space. The author moved them without discussing it first. The BF's reaction was to talk about damaging them, which sounds extreme.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel uncomfortable and wants the bedroom to be a shared space they both enjoy. On the other hand, moving someone else's belongings without discussing it could be seen as overstepping. Communication is important in relationships. Maybe the author should have talked to BF first instead of taking action. The BF's reaction is poor, but that doesn't justify the author's actions if they didn't communicate properly.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their discomfort and took unilateral action. The BF's reaction is bad, but the author could have handled it differently. However, the BF's collection is in their shared bedroom, so the author has a valid point about wanting their space. It's a mix of both sides, but since the author acted without discussion, maybe A (they are in the wrong). Alternatively, maybe B because the BF's reaction is worse. But I think the action of moving the toys without talking first is the problem here. So answer A.\n"
