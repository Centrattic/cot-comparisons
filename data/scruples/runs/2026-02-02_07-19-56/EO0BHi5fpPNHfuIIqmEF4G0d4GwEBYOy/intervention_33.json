He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who moved the toys) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The boyfriend has a large Star Trek collection in their bedroom, which the author isn't into. The author moved the toys to the basement without asking, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions they tried to get into Star Trek but didn't, so maybe they felt it was taking over the space. However, moving the toys without discussing it first could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author is paying half the rent, shared spaces usually require mutual agreement on decor and storage. \n\nThe boyfriend getting upset about potential damage to his collection might come off as childish, but his reaction is understandable if he values those items. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to his interests and belongings. On the other hand, the author has the right to feel comfortable in their shared living space.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author had the right to move the toys without discussing it. Since it's a shared space and the toys are part of his identity, moving them without consent might be wrong. The author should have talked about it first to find a compromise. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
