He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for moving her boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement. The situation is that they just moved in together, and the author didn't like the toys in the bedroom. She moved them to the basement, keeping the posters and a cloth decoration. The boyfriend got upset and threatened to damage the toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is paying half the rent and wants to feel comfortable in the shared bedroom. It's reasonable for her to want some say in the decor. On the other hand, moving someone else's personal belongings without discussing it first could be seen as disrespectful, especially if those items are important to them.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author didn't talk to her boyfriend about her discomfort with the toys before moving them. Instead, she took unilateral action. That might have been a mistake. While she has the right to her preferences, respecting her partner's feelings and possessions is also important. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but his emotional response indicates that the toys are meaningful to him. The author's action could be seen as dismissive of his interests. Even if the toys are in the bedroom, finding a compromise\u2014like a designated shelf or a different room\u2014might have been a better approach after discussing it.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating her intentions first. However, her desire to have input in the shared space is valid. The key issue here is the lack of communication and mutual discussion before taking action. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author being at fault for not discussing it first, even if her reasons are understandable.\n"
