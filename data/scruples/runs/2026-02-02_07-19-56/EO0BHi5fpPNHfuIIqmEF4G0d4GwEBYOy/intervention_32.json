      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for moving their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple just moved in together. The boyfriend has a large collection of Star Trek toys in his bedroom. The author isn't into it and even tried watching the shows but still doesn't get it. Now that they're sharing the space and splitting the rent, the author moved the toys to the basement. The boyfriend got upset, talking about damaging the toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, when two people move in together, they should discuss how to share the space. The author felt entitled to have a say since they're both contributing to the rent. It's reasonable for them to want the bedroom to be comfortable for both. Moving the toys might be seen as a way to balance the shared space without completely removing the boyfriend's items, as they left the posters and other decorations.\n\nBut on the other hand, moving someone's belongings without discussion could be a breach of trust. The boyfriend might feel that his personal collection was being taken away without his input, which could lead to hurt feelings. The key here is communication. If the author didn't talk to the boyfriend first, that's a problem. The boyfriend's reaction about damaging the toys seems extreme, but the author's action might have been the trigger. \n\nHowever, considering that they're in a relationship and cohabiting, it's important to establish boundaries and expectations. The author made a unilateral decision, which could be seen as dismissive of the boyfriend's preferences. Even if the author's intention was to create a shared space, involving the other person in the decision would be better. The fact that the author didn't mention discussing it first suggests a lack of communication, which is a common issue in such situations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting the rent does give the author a right to input on the shared living space. But the method of handling it matters. Removing items without discussion might not be the best approach. The boyfriend's reaction, while perhaps overblown, indicates that the action hurt him. Relationships require compromise and communication, so the author should have talked it through first. \n\nSo, while the author had legitimate concerns about the bedroom's comfort and shared responsibility, the way they handled it might be where they went wrong. They should have discussed the issue with their partner before making changes. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication, even if their intentions were reasonable.\n"
