He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation is they just moved in together, and the BF has a lot of Star Trek stuff in their bedroom. The author didn't like it and tried watching the shows but didn't get into it. Now they want the bedroom decorated in a way they're comfortable with, so they moved the toys to the basement. The BF got upset and talked about damaging his toys. The author thinks the BF overreacted.\n\nHmm, first, moving someone else's belongings without permission is usually a big no-no. Even if they're in a relationship, respecting each other's property is important. The author did pay half the rent, so they might feel entitled to influence the space. But moving the toys without discussing it could be seen as overstepping. Maybe they should have talked about it first instead of acting unilaterally. \n\nThe BF's reaction of threatening to damage his own toys is definitely over the top. But the initial action of moving the toys without consent could be the root of the problem. The author might not be in the wrong if they had communicated their discomfort and reached an agreement. The fact that they left the posters up shows they tried to compromise. But moving the toys without discussing could be seen as disrespectful. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not discussing it first. But the BF's reaction is also extreme. It's a bit of a two-way situation, but the act of moving the toys without consent is a key point here. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for not communicating first.\n"
