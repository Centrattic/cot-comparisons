He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. They provided the situation where they just moved in together, and the author moved the toys to the basement because they don't like it and want to have say in how the bedroom is decorated. The BF got upset, even threatening to damage the toys.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. First, when you move in together, it's about compromise. The author is paying half the rent, so they should have a say in the living space. But moving someone else's personal belongings without discussion might be an issue. Even if the author is doing it for their comfort, communication is key. Did they talk about it first? The author didn't mention discussing it with the BF before moving the toys. Just taking that action without a conversation could be seen as a problem. Also, the BF's reaction is extreme, but he's an adult and has the right to feel his belongings were disrespected. The author might have overstepped by moving them without agreement. However, the BF's threat to damage the toys is also unhelpful. So, maybe the author should have discussed it first. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not communicating and making a unilateral decision.\n"
