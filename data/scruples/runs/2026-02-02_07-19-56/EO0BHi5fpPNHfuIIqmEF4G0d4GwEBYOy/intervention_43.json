He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.

I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for moving their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement. The situation involves moving in together, sharing the bedroom, and the author feeling that they should have a say in the decor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that they paid half the rent and wanted the bedroom to be comfortable for them. Moving the toys to the basement could be seen as their way of asserting their space and preferences. However, moving someone else's belongings without their consent might be a problem. It's a shared space, so compromise is necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction of threatening to damage his toys sounds excessive. But the author moved his property without discussing it first. That could be seen as overstepping, even if their intention was to create a shared living environment. \n\nI should think about communication. The author tried to watch shows with him but didn't get into it. Maybe a conversation about space and preferences could have been better. Moving the toys without discussing it might have caused the conflict. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is important. Threatening to damage the toys is not acceptable, but the initial action of moving them without consent might be the root of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, shared spaces require mutual agreement. The author had a valid point about their comfort, but the method of resolving it might be the issue. They could have talked about it instead of acting unilaterally. \n\nSo, the author might be partly wrong for moving the toys without discussing it first, even if their intention was to create a shared space. But the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that they moved the toys without consent, which is a shared space and belongings, that could be the main issue here. So the answer might be A.\n"
