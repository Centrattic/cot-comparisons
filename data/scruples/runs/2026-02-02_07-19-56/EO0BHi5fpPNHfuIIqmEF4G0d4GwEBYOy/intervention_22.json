He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in together, and the author decided to move the toys to the basement because they don't like them and want the bedroom to be comfortable for them too. The boyfriend got upset and threatened to damage the toys.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author argues that they're paying half the rent and should have a say in how the shared space is decorated. They left some decorations like posters up, just the toys. On the other hand, the boyfriend is upset because his collection is personal, and moving them without discussion could be seen as dismissive of his interests and a lack of communication.\n\nThe key points here are communication and shared space. The author didn't talk to their partner first, which might have been the right move. Even if they're paying rent, the bedroom is a shared space, so both should have input. Moving the toys without discussing it could be seen as overstepping, especially since the boyfriend has a significant collection. However, the author's point about wanting to feel comfortable is valid. It's a balance between respecting each other's preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of threatening to damage the toys is probably not appropriate, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was right to move them without talking. The main issue here is the lack of communication. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't discuss it first, even if their intention was to create a shared space they both like. The answer would depend on whether the action of moving the toys without discussion is considered wrong, regardless of the intention.\n"
