He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who moved their partner's toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who just moved in together. The author (the person who moved the toys) is not into Star Trek, even after trying to watch the shows with their boyfriend. The bedroom is the issue here, and the author decided to move the toys to the basement because they wanted a say in how the room is decorated, as they're paying half the rent. The boyfriend got upset and mentioned damaging the toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid point about wanting to feel comfortable in their shared space and contributing to the decor since they're splitting the rent. It's reasonable for them to want some control over their living environment. On the other hand, moving someone else's belongings without discussion could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction about damaging the toys might be extreme, but the toys are his personal property. The author didn't ask for permission, which could be a problem.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. Even if the author felt they needed to act, the right approach would have been to discuss it with their partner first. Sudden decisions can cause hurt feelings, especially when it comes to personal items. However, the author's intention was to create a comfortable shared space, which is also valid. The boyfriend's threat to damage the toys is inappropriate, but that doesn't justify the author's actions without prior discussion.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for moving the toys without talking to their partner? In a shared living situation, both partners should have a say in how common spaces are arranged. However, moving someone's personal items without consent might be seen as disrespectful. The answer hinges on whether moving the toys without discussion was the wrong thing to do, regardless of the reason. The author's justification is valid, but the method could be better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating first, even if their intention was to create a shared space.\n"
