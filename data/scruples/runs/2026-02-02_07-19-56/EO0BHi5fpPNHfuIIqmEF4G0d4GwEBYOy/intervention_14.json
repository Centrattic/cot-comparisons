He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement) is in the wrong. The situation involves a new living arrangement where the author feels their input should matter, especially since they're paying half the rent. \n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author mentions they've tried to engage with the collection by watching shows but still don't connect. Moving the toys without discussing it first might have been a breach of communication. Even if they share a bedroom, both partners should have a say in the shared space. However, moving someone else's belongings without consent can be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction about damaging the toys seems extreme, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions without prior discussion. The author's right to be comfortable is valid, but so is the boyfriend's right to have his personal items respected. A better approach might have been to talk about the space and find a compromise, like creating a dedicated area for the toys instead of moving them all to the basement.\n\nSo, while the author's intention to create a comfortable living space is understandable, moving the items without discussing it first could be seen as disregarding the boyfriend's feelings and ownership. The answer hinges on whether communication was attempted before taking action. Since the author didn't mention discussing it first, that might put them in the wrong.\n"
