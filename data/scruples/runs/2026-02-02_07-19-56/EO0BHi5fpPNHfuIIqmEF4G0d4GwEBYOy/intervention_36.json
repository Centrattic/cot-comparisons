He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who moved their partner's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, shared space, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The boyfriend has a large collection of Star Trek items in the bedroom. The author tried to get into it but just didn't connect with the franchise. Now, they feel they should have a say in how the bedroom is decorated since they're paying half the rent. They moved the toys to the basement but left posters and a cloth with a symbol up.\n\nThe boyfriend got upset and mentioned damaging his toys, which the author found ridiculous given he's an adult. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nIn a shared living space, both partners should have a say in how the environment looks. However, moving someone's belongings without discussing it first could be seen as overstepping. Communication is key in such situations. The author tried to understand the hobby but still felt uncomfortable, which is valid. But taking action without talking to the partner first might lead to conflict. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, threatening to damage the toys, is definitely inappropriate. However, the author's decision to move the items without prior discussion might have contributed to the tension. It's important to find a middle ground, perhaps discussing the arrangement together to respect both partners' comfort and possessions.\n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether the author acted without communication. If they had discussed their concerns first, maybe a compromise could have been reached. Since they didn't, the author might be at fault for not talking things through. But if the bedroom is a shared space, the author's right to feel comfortable is also valid. It's a bit of a gray area, but the lack of communication likely plays a role in the conflict.\n"
