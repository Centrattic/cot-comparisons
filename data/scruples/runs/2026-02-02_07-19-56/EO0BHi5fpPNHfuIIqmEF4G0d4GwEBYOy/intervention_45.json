He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who moved their partner's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. They want a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend just moved in together. She's not into Star Trek, even though she's tried watching the shows with him. Now that she's living there and contributing to the rent, she feels she should have a say in the bedroom's decoration. So she moved his toys to the basement, leaving the posters and a cloth with a symbol up. He got upset and mentioned damaging his toys, which she found ridiculous.\n\nI need to determine if she was wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, when two people live together, they should discuss shared spaces and come to agreements. She did mention she tried to appreciate his interests but didn't get it. Moving the toys without discussing it might be seen as dismissive of his feelings and the effort he put into collecting them. Even if she's paying rent, it's a shared space, so communication is key. She might have overstepped by acting unilaterally.\n\nOn the other hand, she's entitled to her preferences and should feel comfortable in her own home. Maybe she felt overwhelmed by the toys taking over the room. However, the right approach might have been to talk about it first, maybe find a compromise, like designating a shelf or area for the toys instead of moving them all. Moving them to the basement without discussion could be seen as not respecting his collection and his feelings.\n\nHis reaction about damaging the toys seems extreme, but her moving them without talking might have caused unnecessary conflict. The posters and cloth were left, which shows she considered keeping some of his items, but the toys were a bigger issue. Maybe she should have had a conversation first to understand each other's needs better. So, while she has a point in wanting to feel comfortable, the method she used could be problematic. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not discussing it first. Answer A.\n"
