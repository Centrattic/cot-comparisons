He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about moving their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement because they don't like the collection and want to have a say in the bedroom's decoration.\n\nSo, the author moved the toys without discussing it first. They mention they've tried to get into Star Trek but didn't, so maybe they felt it was taking over the room. But the key point is that they did this action without talking to their partner first. Communication is really important in relationships, especially when it comes to shared spaces. The boyfriend was upset and even talked about damaging the toys, which seems a bit extreme, but the author called it ridiculous. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is paying half the rent and wants their comfort to be considered. On the other hand, taking his stuff without discussing might be seen as overstepping. Even if the boyfriend's reaction is childish, the action of moving the toys without consent is a problem. People can have strong emotional attachments to their collections, and not discussing it first can lead to hurt feelings. The right approach would have been to talk about it, reach a compromise, like finding a different storage solution or rearranging the room together. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because they acted unilaterally instead of communicating. Even if their intention was to create a shared space, moving someone else's belongings without asking can be disrespectful. The boyfriend's reaction is not justified, but the author's actions also weren't appropriate. They should have discussed the matter first.\n"
