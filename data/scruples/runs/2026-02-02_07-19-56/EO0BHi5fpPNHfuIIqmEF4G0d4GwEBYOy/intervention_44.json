He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who moved their partner's toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in together, and the person (the author) didn't like the Star Trek collection in the bedroom. They tried to get into it but couldn't, so they moved the toys to the basement. The boyfriend got upset about it, and the author thinks the reaction was over the top.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is sharing a space and paying rent, so they have a right to have some input on the shared space. But moving someone else's belongings without consent could be an issue. Even if it's their own home now, the toys belong to the boyfriend. The author might have thought it's their home too, but maybe they should have discussed it first.\n\nCommunication is key in a relationship. If the author was uncomfortable with the toys in the bedroom, maybe they should have talked about it instead of taking action. Moving the toys without asking might have been a breach of trust or respect. Even if the author left the posters up, the act of moving personal items could be seen as dismissive of the boyfriend's interests. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction of threatening to damage the toys seems extreme. The author might feel justified in wanting a comfortable living space. But the method of resolving the conflict without discussion might be problematic. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author had the right to move the toys without consulting their partner. In relationships, mutual respect and communication are important. Taking unilateral action might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was to create a shared living space. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't discuss the issue first, even if their intent was valid.\n"
