He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about moving their partner's Star Trek toys to the basement because they don't get into it and want their bedroom to be comfortable. They paid half the rent, so they felt they had a say in the decor. The BF got upset and mentioned damaging the toys. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they moved into a shared space, want their comfort, and tried to understand the BF's interest but didn't get it. Moving the toys was their way to adjust the room. The BF's perspective: his collection is personal, and the author took action without discussing it first, which led to conflict.\n\nKey points: Communication. Did the author talk to their BF before moving the toys? The post says they didn't mention discussing it. Maybe they should have had a conversation about shared space and personal items. The BF might feel his belongings were disrespected. The author's action was unilateral, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the BF's reaction of threatening to damage the toys is extreme, but maybe it's because he felt his space was invaded. The author might have valid reasons for wanting the bedroom to be comfortable for both. But moving someone else's belongings without discussion is a big step. Even if they're paying half the rent, it's a shared space where both should have input. The author could have suggested a compromise, like moving some items or finding a storage solution together. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Acting unilaterally on someone else's personal items can lead to conflict. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they probably didn't handle it the best way. The BF's reaction is problematic, but the author's actions were impulsive without discussion. So, maybe the author is partly in the wrong for not communicating first. But they also have a right to their comfort in the shared space. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the action was moving personal items without consent, even if their intent was to adjust the space, the answer might lean towards A (Yes). But some might say B (No) because they were trying to make the space work for both. Hmm.\n"
