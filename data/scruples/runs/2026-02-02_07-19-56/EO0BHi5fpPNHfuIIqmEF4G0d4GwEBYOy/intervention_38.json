He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in together, and the author moved the toys because they don't like them and want the bedroom to be comfortable for themselves. The boyfriend got upset, threatening to damage the toys, which the author finds ridiculous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that they're paying rent and should have a say in how the bedroom is set up. They tried to get into Star Trek but couldn't, so they took action. The boyfriend's side is that his collection is important to him, and moving them without discussion was disrespectful.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk to the boyfriend first; they just moved the toys. That could be seen as dismissive of his feelings and belongings. Even if they share the rent, it's about mutual respect. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but it's his collection, and losing it could hurt him. The author's intention was to make the space comfortable for themselves, which is valid, but the approach might have been hasty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel comfortable in their own home. If the toys are taking over the bedroom, it's reasonable to want a say. However, moving someone else's property without discussing it first can be seen as a breach of trust and respect. The boyfriend's response is extreme, but the author's action might have caused unnecessary conflict by not addressing it together first.\n\nSo, the key points are communication and mutual respect. The author should have discussed the issue with the boyfriend before taking action. By moving the toys without talking, they didn't consider his feelings, even if their intention was to create a shared space. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for not communicating first, even if their desire for comfort is valid.\n"
