He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple who just moved in together. The author (assuming this is a \"Not the AITA\" post) moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement because they don't like the collection and want their bedroom to be comfortable for both of them. The boyfriend got upset about it, and the author thinks he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author mentions they tried to get into Star Trek but didn't succeed. Now that they're living together and sharing the rent, they want a say in the bedroom's decor. Moving the toys to the basement without discussing it first might be where the issue lies. \n\nEven though the author has a valid point about wanting their own space, moving someone else's belongings without talking about it can come off as dismissive. The boyfriend's reaction about damaging the toys seems extreme, but the author's action might have been a trigger. The fact that the author left the posters up suggests they tried to maintain some balance, but moving the toys without discussion could be seen as a unilateral decision.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author might have handled this better by discussing the issue with the boyfriend first, explaining their discomfort, and finding a solution together. By taking the action without communication, the author might have overlooked the emotional value of the collection to the boyfriend. So, while the author has a legitimate desire for comfort in their shared space, the method of resolving it could be at fault. That makes me think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
