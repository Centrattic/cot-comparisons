      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about moving a partner's Star Trek toys to the basement.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're new to living together. The boyfriend has a big collection, and the author isn't into it. They tried watching the shows but still don't get it. Now that they're sharing the apartment and splitting rent, the author feels they should have a say in how the bedroom looks. So they moved the toys to the basement but left the posters and a cloth with a symbol up.\n\nThe boyfriend got upset and threatened to damage his own toys, which the author finds ridiculous for an adult. The question is whether the author was wrong for doing this.\n\nHmm. When couples move in together, shared spaces can be a point of contention. The author's reasoning is about personal comfort and contributing to shared living expenses, so they want some say. On the other hand, moving someone else's belongings without consent might be seen as overstepping, even if it's their own home. But the author did leave some of the items up, like posters, which might be part of the compromise.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. Did the author talk to the boyfriend about their discomfort before taking action? If they didn't discuss it and just moved the toys, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they had a conversation and the boyfriend wasn't responsive, the author might have a valid point.\n\nHowever, the author's action of moving the toys without discussing it first might have been abrupt. Even if they have a right to an input in the bedroom's decoration, taking unilateral action could be seen as dismissive of the boyfriend's feelings and possessions. The boyfriend's reaction, threatening to damage his own toys, is indeed odd, but that doesn't justify the author's action without discussion.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have a right to their living space. But the way they handled it\u2014without prior communication\u2014could be problematic. The correct answer might hinge on whether the author considered the boyfriend's perspective and communicated their needs effectively. Since the author didn't mention discussing it first, it's possible they acted without considering the other person's feelings, which could put them in the wrong.\n"
