He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. He has a big Star Trek toy collection in their bedroom. The author isn't into it, even though they tried watching the shows with him. Now that they're living together and splitting rent, the author moved his toys to the basement. The boyfriend got upset and mentioned damaging the toys, which the author finds ridiculous.\n\nHmm, first, communication is key in relationships. The author moved the toys without discussing it with their boyfriend. Even if they have a right to their own space, maybe they should have talked about it first. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but that doesn't mean the author was right to act unilaterally. Sharing a bedroom means both people have a say in how the space is used. The author did leave the posters and other items, which is a compromise, but moving a significant collection without discussion could be seen as dismissive of the boyfriend's interests.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel comfortable in their shared space. If the toys were taking over the bedroom and making the author uncomfortable, maybe some compromise was needed. But the way they handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe they should have discussed moving some items to the basement together instead of doing it without talking. The boyfriend's threat to damage the toys is concerning, but it doesn't justify the author's actions if they didn't communicate their needs first.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be at fault for not talking to their partner before making a decision that affects both of them. Relationships require negotiation and mutual respect. The author's action, while coming from a place of wanting comfort, might have been a bit selfish in not considering the boyfriend's feelings and the importance of his collection to him. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
