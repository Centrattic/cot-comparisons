He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement because they don't like the collection and want the bedroom to be comfortable for both of them. The boyfriend got upset and threatened to damage his own toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions they tried watching the shows with the boyfriend but still didn't get into it. Maybe they didn't talk about their discomfort with the toys being in the bedroom? If they had discussed it before moving the toys, the boyfriend might have been more understanding. But since they didn't, maybe the author felt they had to take action.\n\nOn the other hand, moving someone else's belongings without discussing it can be a big deal. Even if the author is paying half the rent and wants a say, taking unilateral action might be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but his upset is valid because his personal property was moved without consent. The author might have a point about wanting a say in the shared space, but the method of handling it could be the issue.\n\nAlso, the author left the posters and the cloth symbol. Maybe they tried to compromise by leaving some of the decorations. But the key issue here is the act of moving the toys without agreement. In a shared living situation, both partners should have input, but both need to respect each other's belongings and boundaries.\n\nSo, while the author's intent to create a comfortable shared space is understandable, moving the toys without discussion might have been a mistake. The correct approach might have been to talk it over first. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not communicating properly before taking action. But it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points.\n"
