He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (the author) moved their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement because they didn't like the bedroom being filled with them. They mention they tried to get into Star Trek but didn't, and they wanted to have a say in how the bedroom looked since they're paying half the rent. The BF got upset and threatened to damage his toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is about feeling entitled to their space and comfort in the shared bedroom. They might feel that the room should be a shared space, not dominated by the BF's collection. On the other hand, the BF might see his collection as personal property and feel that moving it without his consent is a violation.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author moved the toys without discussing it first. Even if they had a right to want shared space, not talking to the BF first could have caused unnecessary conflict. Maybe they should have had a conversation about how to balance both their preferences. \n\nAlso, the BF's reaction might be over the top, but threatening to damage items is definitely not okay. However, the author's action of moving the toys without permission could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. \n\nThe room is a shared space, so both should have input. The author has a point in wanting to contribute to the room's decor. But the method they used was unilateral. Perhaps a better approach would have been to negotiate where to place the toys, maybe in a different area or part of the room, keeping some while moving others. \n\nAnother angle: moving someone's belongings without their consent can be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the reasoning. Even if the author's intention was to create a more comfortable space for themselves, they should have discussed it with the BF first. \n\nBut the BF's collection is extensive, and if it's taking over the room, the author has a valid concern. They both need to find a middle ground. The author's action might have been a reaction to feeling overwhelmed, but the way they handled it could have been improved.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? They might be partially at fault for not communicating first, but their desire for shared space is understandable. The BF's reaction is also problematic. However, the act of moving someone's property without permission is typically considered wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the issue with their partner before taking action.\n"
