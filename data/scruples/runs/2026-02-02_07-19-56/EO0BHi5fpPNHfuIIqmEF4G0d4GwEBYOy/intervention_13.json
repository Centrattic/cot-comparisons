He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.   The whole thing sounded ridiculous coming from an adult man.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple who just moved in together. The author (presumably the girlfriend) moved her boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement because she doesn't like them and wants the bedroom decorated in a way that makes her comfortable. The boyfriend got upset, threatening to damage his toys, which the author found ridiculous.\n\nFirst, the key points here are shared living space and mutual respect. When two people move in together, especially when splitting rent, they both have a right to a comfortable living environment. The author feels she should have a say in the bedroom's decor since she's contributing to the rent. On the other hand, the boyfriend's collection is his personal property and part of his identity. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as overstepping because moving someone's belongings without discussion can be a breach of trust and respect. Even if she didn't like the toys, the right approach would be to communicate her feelings and find a compromise, like designating a specific area for the collection or creating a shared space that incorporates both their preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, threatening to damage his toys, is definitely inappropriate. However, his reaction might be an overreaction because he should have discussed his feelings about the collection's placement earlier. The author's decision to act without discussing it first could have led to that conflict. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend's response is wrong, the author's unilateral action without communication also plays a role. The question is whether her action (moving the toys) is in the wrong. Since she didn't consult him and took it upon herself, that could be seen as disrespectful. But she also has a valid point about shared space. However, the way she handled it might be the issue. The correct approach would be communication and negotiation, not unilateral action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't discuss it first, even if her intent was to create a comfortable space for herself.\n"
