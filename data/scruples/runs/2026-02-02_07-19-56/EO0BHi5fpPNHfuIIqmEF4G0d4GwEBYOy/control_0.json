He has a huge collection of Star Trek toys and other stuff in his bedroom.  I am just not into it.  I\u2019ve tried.  I\u2019ve even watched the shows with him and I just don\u2019t get it.  \n\nNow that I\u2019m living here and paying half the rent I felt like I should have a say in how our bedroom is decorated.   I have to be comfortable here too.  So I moved his toys to the basement.   I left his posters up though and the cloth thing with a symbol on it on the wall.  \n\nHe got upset and talked about damaging his toys.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for moving their boyfriend's Star Trek toys to the basement.\n\nFirst, the situation: They just moved in together. The BF has a big collection in his bedroom. The author isn't into Star Trek and moved the toys to the basement, leaving posters and some cloth. The BF got upset, talking about damaging the toys. The author thinks the BF's reaction is ridiculous.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. When two people move in together, it's important to discuss how they want to use the space. The author felt they should have a say since they're paying half the rent. That makes sense, but moving things without discussing might be the issue. \n\nThe author tried to watch the shows to understand but didn't get into it. That shows effort. However, taking action without talking first could have been the problem. Maybe the BF felt his stuff was being devalued. The author left some items up, like posters, so maybe they tried to compromise. \n\nThe BF's reaction about damaging the toys seems extreme, but that doesn't mean the author is right. The main question is whether moving the toys was wrong. If they didn't communicate beforehand, that's a problem. Shared spaces require agreement. The author's action might have been a decision without discussion, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't talk to their partner first. Even if they have a valid reason, it's important to discuss and reach a mutual agreement instead of acting unilaterally. The BF's reaction is over the top, but the author's action could be seen as disrespectful without prior conversation.\n"
