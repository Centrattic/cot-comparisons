We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together two years, live together, and usually have little friction. The issue here is the nose ring, which the author finds extremely gross and uncomfortable. They told their girlfriend that if she gets a nose ring, he'd break up with her. She argued that this is controlling, and he agreed she has autonomy over her body but still made the ultimatum.\n\nSo, autonomy over one's body is a big point here. The girlfriend is asserting her right to modify her body as she sees fit. The author's stance is that he can't be in a relationship with someone who has a nose ring. That seems like a personal preference, but making it a deal-breaker might be overstepping. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy is also relevant. She questions if he'd break up over her injury causing discomfort. The author says he wouldn't, which makes her feel he's being inconsistent. That could suggest that his reasoning is more about control than genuine discomfort. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and choices unless they directly harm the other. The author is respecting her autonomy in words but enforcing a condition that removes her agency. That seems contradictory. Making a choice based on a physical appearance preference as a deal-breaker might not be fair, especially if it's not a health or safety issue. \n\nHowever, the author is honest about his feelings. He's not hiding his discomfort. The problem is whether it's reasonable to end a relationship over a personal aesthetic choice. That's subjective, but in many cases, such preferences shouldn't dictate the continuation of a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's her body, and she's making a choice that doesn't harm him. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his personal preference as a non-negotiable, which infringes on his partner's autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
