We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (AITA) is in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, and they live together. They usually get along, but this argument about nose rings is a big deal now. He told her he's grossed out by nose rings and that if she gets one, he'd be uncomfortable and it would be a dealbreaker. She felt controlled and argued that he shouldn't dictate her body choices, and then brought up a hypothetical about her being injured, which made him reconsider.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my view. I need to decide if AITA is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's consider dealbreakers in relationships. It's common for people to have certain boundaries that, if crossed, might lead to a breakup. However, the issue here is whether the nose ring is a valid dealbreaker. Body modifications like nose rings are personal choices and often about self-expression. The fact that the author finds them gross is a personal preference, but does that make it a dealbreaker?\n\nThe key points are: The author is not judging others for having nose rings, but he's uncomfortable with his girlfriend having one. He acknowledges her right to control her body but still says it's a dealbreaker. She sees this as controlling, which is a valid concern. The comparison to supporting her if she's injured is important. If he can support her in a situation where he's also uncomfortable (like an injury), why can't he support her getting a nose ring? That makes the author's stance seem inconsistent or overly controlling.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is crucial. While it's okay to express discomfort, making a significant personal choice a dealbreaker without compromise can be seen as controlling. The author didn't try to negotiate or understand the importance of the nose ring to his girlfriend. Instead, he presented a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum. That's a problem because it's not respecting her agency. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning might not hold up. If he can support her through an injury, which is a more serious and involuntary change, then his discomfort with a nose ring\u2014a choice she's making for herself\u2014seems trivial in comparison. This inconsistency likely contributed to her feeling that he's being hypocritical.\n\nSo, while the author has a right to his preferences, using them as a dealbreaker in this context without mutual discussion or consideration could be seen as wrong. It's about balancing personal boundaries with respect for the partner's body autonomy. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's imposing his preference as a dealbreaker, which could be controlling. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if the user believes personal boundaries are valid even if they cause discomfort. \n\nHowever, the comparison to the injury argument is strong. Supporting a partner through necessary, non-optional changes shows true support, whereas an optional body modification is more about aesthetic preferences. The author's discomfort here is about a choice that's hers to make, and making it a dealbreaker might be crossing a line. Therefore, AITA is probably in the wrong.\n"
