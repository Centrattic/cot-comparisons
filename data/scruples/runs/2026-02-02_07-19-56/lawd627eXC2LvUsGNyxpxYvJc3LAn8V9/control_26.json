We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. So, the situation is that the author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend that if she gets one, he can't be in a relationship with her. They've been dating two years, living together, and this caused a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says nose rings make him uncomfortable and it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues that the author is being controlling. The author acknowledges she should control her body but then says he can't be with her if she gets one. The girlfriend brings up a hypothetical about her being injured and him not leaving her, which he says he wouldn't, but she feels hypocritical.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy. If one person has a strong physical reaction to something the partner wants to do, that's a personal boundary. However, making an ultimatum like breaking up over a body modification could be seen as controlling because it's about how he feels about her appearance. It's a personal choice, and while the author has the right to his feelings, using that to end the relationship might be crossing a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his discomfort. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's stating his dealbreaker. If the girlfriend is okay with getting a nose ring despite his feelings, then his decision to leave might be based on his own comfort. But in relationships, compromise is key. If he's not willing to accept something that doesn't harm him (a nose ring) but would accept her in a situation beyond her control (injury), that inconsistency might support the girlfriend's point. However, the two situations aren't the same. An injury is involuntary and about support, while a nose ring is a personal choice. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible that he's being too controlling by making her appearance a dealbreaker. However, if he's clear from the start about his boundaries, and she's willing to proceed, it's his right to decide the relationship's future. The key here is whether the ultimatum is reasonable. Since nose rings are a personal choice and don't affect his well-being, making it a dealbreaker could be seen as unreasonable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if the reasoning holds up. Alternatively, if the author is upfront and the girlfriend respects that, it's not controlling. But if he's using it to control her body, then it's wrong. The line here is thin, but since the author allows her to choose but can't be with her, it's possible he's in the right (B) because he's stating his boundaries. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is important, so making her choose between her body and the relationship is problematic. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
