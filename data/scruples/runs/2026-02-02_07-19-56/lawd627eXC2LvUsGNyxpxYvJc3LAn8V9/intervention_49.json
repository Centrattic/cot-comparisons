We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, and they live together. The main issue is that the girlfriend wants to get a nose ring, which the author finds gross and uncomfortable. He told her that if she gets one, he might break up with her. She's upset because she feels he's being controlling. The author argues that he's not trying to control her body, but that the nose rings are a dealbreaker for him. The girlfriend compared it to a hypothetical situation where she might be injured and he would support her despite discomfort, but he admitted that might be different. Now he's questioning if he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of autonomy. The girlfriend wants to modify her body as she sees fit. Body autonomy is a significant right, and generally, people should have the freedom to make such decisions. The author's reaction might be seen as infringing on that autonomy if he's using the relationship as a reason to prevent her from getting a nose ring.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing his personal discomfort. It's important to acknowledge that personal preferences can influence relationships. The key question here is whether his reaction is reasonable and respectful. If he's not pressuring her or making her feel bad about her choice beyond his own discomfort, but instead is setting a boundary that he's not willing to be in a relationship where she has a nose ring, is that a legitimate boundary?\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are common. For example, some people might find smoking a dealbreaker, or not wanting to have children. The problem arises when the dealbreaker is based on something that's not harmful to the other person and is a matter of personal choice. A nose ring is a form of self-expression, and while the author finds it gross, it doesn't harm him physically. So, is it fair to use personal aesthetics as a dealbreaker?\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy is interesting. She's pointing out that if she had a physical change due to injury, he would support her, even if it made him uncomfortable. The author admits that the situations feel different to him. This comparison might highlight that his issue with the nose ring is a choice she's making, whereas an injury isn't. But the distinction here is whether the choice is valid. If he can support her in other scenarios where her appearance changes, why can't he support her choice here?\n\nAnother angle is the level of control. The author is essentially saying that if she goes against his personal discomfort, he will end the relationship. That could be seen as using his autonomy to control her decision, even if it's framed as respecting her autonomy. The line between personal boundaries and controlling behavior can be thin. \n\nAlso, the fact that they live together and have been in a committed relationship for two years means that such a significant decision (a breakup based on a body modification) is a major consequence. The author should consider whether there's room for compromise or if this is an absolute dealbreaker. Maybe discussing if there's a way for them to navigate this without breaking up, like counseling or adjusting their expectations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while nose rings are more accepted now, there might still be personal aversions. However, the author's reaction is extreme in that he's threatening to end the relationship over it. That level of reaction might be disproportionate unless there's a deeper issue. It's possible that the nose ring is a symbol of something else in their relationship, but the question is about the situation as described.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author's stance is based on his personal discomfort, but using a breakup as a consequence is a strong measure. The girlfriend's right to her body is a fundamental right. The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy, which might make him in the wrong. However, if he's genuinely found this to be a dealbreaker and is being honest, that's also a valid part of a relationship. But the way he's phrased it\u2014ultimatum\u2014might be problematic because it's a significant action based on his personal preference rather than something that directly affects their relationship's health.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the girlfriend is making a choice about her own body and the author is using the threat of breaking up to prevent her, that's controlling. However, if he's being honest about his boundaries and the breakup is a result of mutual incompatibility, then maybe it's not his fault. But given that it's a personal choice without harm, it's more likely that the author is overstepping by making it a dealbreaker. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
