We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author states that they find nose rings gross and uncomfortable. They've been dating for two years, live together, and usually have little friction. The conflict arose when the girlfriend mentioned wanting a nose ring. The author said it's a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup threat. The girlfriend felt controlled and hypocritical when the author mentioned supporting her if she were injured.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author believes that nose rings are a dealbreaker, but is it fair for them to impose that on their partner? In relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is important. The girlfriend's argument about her right to her body is valid. However, the author also has the right to their own comfort. But when someone's personal choice leads to a breakup threat, that can be seen as controlling. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't be in a relationship with someone who has a nose ring. But isn't that similar to other personal preferences where couples can find a compromise? If the author can't accept her choice, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. That said, breaking up over a body modification might seem extreme to some. The girlfriend's point about potential injury is a good counterargument. The author's response here shows they might not be considering her perspective fully. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is upfront about their feelings and doesn't force her to get a ring. They just set a boundary. But setting a boundary that ends the relationship over a non-harmful choice could be seen as the author's issue. \n\nI think the line between being honest and being controlling is thin here. The author might be prioritizing their discomfort over their partner's autonomy. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They're using a breakup threat for a personal preference that doesn't harm the relationship beyond their own feelings, which isn't a solid enough reason. But I can see arguments both ways. Some might say it's okay to have dealbreakers, but nose rings are more about self-expression, so the author's stance could be seen as restrictive.\n"
