We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. Let's start by understanding both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that nose rings gross them out and they're uncomfortable with them. They've been in a two-year relationship with their girlfriend, who wanted to get a nose ring. The author told her that if she got one, he might break up, which led to an argument. The girlfriend felt controlled because the author is making a decision about her body, even though he said she should be in charge of her body. The author argues that it's a dealbreaker for him, but the girlfriend is upset because she feels her autonomy is being questioned.\n\nFirst, dealbreakers in relationships are personal. If something truly makes one person uncomfortable to the point of breaking up, it's not inherently wrong for them to state that. However, the key here is whether the author is being controlling. The girlfriend's argument is that by making a choice about her body, he's being controlling. But the author does acknowledge her right to her body and states he's not trying to control her, just that he can't be in a relationship if she gets a nose ring. \n\nAnother point is the comparison she made about supporting her if she was injured. The author's response was that supporting her is different because it's not a choice she's making. But the girlfriend sees the discomfort as similar. The author might not see it the same way, but that's where the conflict lies. The difference is that a nose ring is a conscious choice affecting appearance, while an injury is an accident. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily controlling; he's expressing a personal boundary. However, the ultimatum could be seen as problematic if it's about her autonomy. In healthy relationships, both partners have autonomy, but sometimes personal boundaries can lead to dealbreakers. The question is whether the author is overstepping by making this a dealbreaker. \n\nBut since the author is honest about his feelings and the girlfriend is choosing to pursue something that affects his comfort, it's a mutual decision. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's stating his own limit. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest about his dealbreaker, but he should consider if there's a way to compromise or if this is a valid boundary. However, the girlfriend's right to her body is also important. So, there's a balance here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for having a personal boundary, but it's a tough spot. The answer would depend on whether making the dealbreaker is reasonable. Since the author isn't controlling her but stating his own limit, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
