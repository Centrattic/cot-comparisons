We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy giving his girlfriend an ultimatum over a nose ring.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author says he's really grossed out by nose rings and that it's a dealbreaker for him. He told his girlfriend she shouldn't get one, and when she wanted to, he said he'd break up with her. She felt he was being controlling, and he acknowledges she should have autonomy over her body but still uses that as a reason to end the relationship.\n\nOn one hand, people should have the right to modify their bodies as they choose. The girlfriend is within her rights to want a nose ring. The author's reaction, while based on his personal discomfort, is leading to a break-up because he can't accept her choice. That does seem controlling because he's denying her autonomy in a way that affects their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships often require compromise. If this is a genuine dealbreaker for the author, maybe he's being honest about his feelings. But dealbreakers should typically be about core values or incompatible issues, not personal aesthetics that don't harm the other person. The girlfriend's question about a hypothetical injury makes sense because in that case, supporting her would be expected, so it's a test of consistency. The author's answer there shows he might be inconsistent, which she points out as hypocrisy.\n\nAlso, the argument is that controlling behavior is harmful. By making her choice about her body a dealbreaker, he's making her decision about her own body dependent on his comfort, which is not fair. True respect would mean accepting her autonomy even if it's uncomfortable. The fact that they usually have little friction but this is causing a big argument suggests this is a significant issue for the author, but it's not something that should override her right to choose her appearance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's being controlling and not respecting her autonomy in a non-essential personal choice. The answer should be A.\n"
