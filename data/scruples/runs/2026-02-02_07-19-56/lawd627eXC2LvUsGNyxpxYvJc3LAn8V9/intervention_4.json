We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who gives his girlfriend an ultimatum regarding getting a nose ring. He's really grossed out by them and says it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues that he's being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states that nose rings make him uncomfortable and he doesn't want her to get one. He acknowledges she should control her body but still makes it a dealbreaker. The girlfriend feels he's being controlling, especially when she brings up the hypothetical about her being injured. The author's response is that supporting her would be the right thing in that case, but he feels it's different for a nose ring. \n\nI think the main issue here is about personal autonomy versus personal comfort. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her own body, including body modifications like a nose ring. The author is trying to impose his personal discomfort as a condition for staying in the relationship, which can be seen as controlling. Relationships require compromise, but there's a line between expressing discomfort and making it a dealbreaker. \n\nHowever, the author does acknowledge her autonomy, which is a good sign. But making a choice about one's body a dealbreaker might be an overreaction. The girlfriend's argument about the hypothetical injury highlights the inconsistency. If he would stay with her despite an injury that causes discomfort, why is the nose ring different? That suggests his stance might be about control rather than just his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different boundaries. Maybe for him, this is a significant issue. But generally, body autonomy is a strong point in favor of the girlfriend. So, the author might be in the wrong for making it a dealbreaker instead of finding a middle ground or accepting her choice. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
