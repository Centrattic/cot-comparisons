We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author says they're really grossed out by nose rings and made an ultimatum for their girlfriend. They've been dating two years and live together. The girlfriend wanted a nose ring, and the author said it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend felt controlled, and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Both are adults, and the girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her body. The author's discomfort is valid, but is it a legitimate reason to break up? The key here is whether the author is overstepping by making it a dealbreaker. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about being in control of her body is a strong point. It's her body, and while partners can express preferences, making it a dealbreaker might be seen as controlling. The author tried to explain their feelings, but setting that ultimatum could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the comparison she made about being injured makes the author reconsider. The author acknowledged that they wouldn't break up over an injury, which is a valid point. The difference here is that the nose ring is a choice, but the author's reaction might still be seen as hypocritical. \n\nHowever, relationships involve compromise. If the author's discomfort is genuine and strong enough to affect the relationship, maybe it's their issue to deal with. But if they're making their partner change something about themselves to accommodate their discomfort, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the author's intentions might be to be honest about their feelings, but the way they presented it as an ultimatum might be the problem. It's a tough line between being honest and being controlling. Since the girlfriend is free to choose her body modifications, the author's stance could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
