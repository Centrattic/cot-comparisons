We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being really grossed out by nose rings and that it makes them uncomfortable. They've been in a two-year relationship where they usually don't have much conflict. The girlfriend wanted a nose ring, and the author gave her an ultimatum: either she doesn't get it, or they break up. The girlfriend felt it was controlling, and the author tried to explain it's about their personal comfort, not judging others. The girlfriend compared it to a hypothetical injury, which the author agreed they wouldn't break up over, but the girlfriend felt hypocritical.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nKey points to consider: personal autonomy vs. personal preferences. The girlfriend's right to modify her body versus the author's comfort. In a relationship, there are usually some compromise points. But where is the line between reasonable compromise and controlling behavior?\n\nNose rings are a form of self-expression and a personal choice. The author is saying that their discomfort is so severe that they can't continue the relationship. While it's valid to have personal preferences, making a life decision based on such a specific aesthetic choice might be seen as overly controlling. The girlfriend's argument about body autonomy is a strong point. If the author can't accept that choice, maybe the relationship has deeper issues about respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nHowever, love and relationships do involve certain dealbreakers. The author might genuinely feel that this is a dealbreaker, and they're being honest. But the way it's presented as an ultimatum might be the issue. Instead of giving an ultimatum, maybe discussing it more collaboratively would have been better. The girlfriend's argument about hypothetical injuries highlights the inconsistency in the author's reasoning\u2014supporting her in hard times but not in a personal choice. That could make the author's stance seem more controlling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, personal preferences exist. On the other, respecting a partner's autonomy is crucial. The ultimatum approach could be seen as controlling because it's imposing one's preferences as a non-negotiable condition. The fact that the girlfriend felt it was controlling suggests that maybe the author overstepped. Therefore, leaning towards A (wrong).\n"
