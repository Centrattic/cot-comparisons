We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author who gave their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings, even though they don't judge others. They've been in a two-year relationship, living together, and the girlfriend wants to get a nose ring. The author told her that if she gets one, they'd break up. The girlfriend feels controlled, and there's a debate about body autonomy. The author argues that the discomfort is a dealbreaker, but the girlfriend counters with a hypothetical about an injury.\n\nSo, the key points here are body autonomy vs. personal boundaries. The author is asserting their boundary but in a way that affects the relationship. The girlfriend argues that the author is controlling her body, which is a valid concern because one person's body choices shouldn't be controlled by a partner unless there's mutual agreement. However, the author is stating that the discomfort is a dealbreaker, which is their personal right as well.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. In relationships, both partners have the right to express their boundaries, but it's also important to consider if those boundaries are reasonable or if they infringe on the other's autonomy. The author is using the threat of breaking up over a body modification, which is a personal choice. However, if this is a genuine dealbreaker for the author, they have the right to set that boundary. But the way it's presented as an ultimatum might be seen as controlling, especially if the author isn't willing to compromise. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about supporting her in case of injury is a valid point. If the author can support her in that scenario, why not in this one? The author's response that it feels different might not be convincing. This could indicate inconsistency. However, the author is not necessarily being controlling if their discomfort is genuine. It's about whether a relationship can survive such a personal preference. \n\nIn terms of relationship advice, it's often suggested that major dealbreakers should be discussed early. Since they've been together two years, maybe the author should have mentioned this earlier. But since they haven't had this issue before, it's possible it's a new development. The key is whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's autonomy. By saying it's a dealbreaker, the author is imposing their preference on the relationship, which can be seen as right if both are in agreement. But since they aren't, the author is forcing their view, which might be considered controlling. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal boundaries. If the author is truly unable to be in a relationship without this discomfort, they might not be wrong in prioritizing their own well-being. However, breaking up over a body modification that doesn't affect the relationship beyond aesthetics is a significant decision. It might be seen as an asshole move because it's a personal choice that the girlfriend wants to make. \n\nSo, there's a balance here. The author has the right to their preferences, but using it as an ultimatum could be seen as wrong because it's taking away the girlfriend's agency. The answer might be A (yes) because the author is using a personal preference as a dealbreaker, which can be controlling. However, if the author is genuine about their discomfort and it's affecting their well-being, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut in the context of relationship advice, usually, it's considered okay to have dealbreakers as long as they are communicated respectfully. However, the way the author presented it as an ultimatum without trying to find a compromise might be seen as wrong. The girlfriend's right to her body is a strong point. So, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
