We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been dating two years, live together. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings, to the point of it being a dealbreaker. He told his girlfriend that if she gets a nose ring, he can't be in the relationship. She felt controlled and they argued. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, in relationships, personal boundaries are important. But so is autonomy. The author is saying that his comfort level is so low that he's using it as a dealbreaker. The girlfriend is arguing that she should have control over her own body. That's a significant point. \n\nThe author says he doesn't judge others with nose rings, but himself. That's valid, but when it comes to a partner, wanting to influence their body choices can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's counter-argument about hypothetical injuries is a good point. If she were injured and he couldn't look at her, he'd stay. But with the nose ring, he's leaving. The inconsistency here might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that this led to a breakup ultimatum is a big deal. In healthy relationships, major decisions shouldn't be used as ultimatums unless they're truly non-negotiable. But is a nose ring that? Maybe for some people it is, but others might see it as not worth breaking up over. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about his own discomfort, which is personal. However, the girlfriend's right to choose her appearance is her own. The line between being respectful of her autonomy and asserting his own boundaries is thin here. The fact that he's willing to end the relationship over this suggests it's more about his inability to handle discomfort rather than a mutual compromise. \n\nThe girlfriend's feeling of being controlled is valid. Even if he respects her autonomy in theory, putting an ultimatum on her body choice can be seen as controlling. The author might not be evil, but maybe he's not considering her perspective enough. The comparison to supporting her in a disability scenario shows a lack of consistency. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy without a strong enough reason. The answer is likely A.\n"
