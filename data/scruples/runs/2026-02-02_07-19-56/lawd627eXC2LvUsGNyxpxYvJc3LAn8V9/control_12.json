We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. Their girlfriend wants to get one, and he told her that if she does, he would break up. They argue, and she feels controlled. He says he agrees she should be in charge of her body but then makes a dealbreaker out of it. She also brings up a hypothetical about her being injured, which he says he wouldn't break up over, but he thinks it's different.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries, autonomy, and whether the author's reaction is controlling. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is clear about his feelings and is honest with his girlfriend. He's stating that this is a dealbreaker for him. It's his right to set his own boundaries, especially in a relationship. However, the way he's presenting it as an ultimatum could be seen as controlling because he's making a significant decision based on his discomfort, potentially overriding her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has the right to make choices about her body. The author's argument that he supports her autonomy but then uses that choice as a dealbreaker might be contradictory. The fact that he's willing to break up over this but wouldn't over a hypothetical injury suggests inconsistency. That inconsistency could make his stance seem less about genuine concern for her well-being and more about personal preference, which might be controlling.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't have many other issues and this is a big argument might indicate that the author is overreacting. However, dealbreakers are personal, and if something is truly a dealbreaker, it's not necessarily wrong to act on it. The problem is whether the author is being hypocritical or controlling by making a choice that affects his partner's autonomy.\n\nI think the crux is whether the author is being controlling. If he's honest about his feelings and allows her to make her choice without pressure, but decides that he can't be in a relationship with her if she goes through with the nose ring, that's his right. But if he's using that as a manipulative tool or not respecting her autonomy, then he's in the wrong. The fact that he says she should do it if she wants it but then breaks up over it complicates things. It might be a dealbreaker for him, but he's also not respecting her decision once she makes it. \n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are common, but they need to be communicated clearly. However, when one partner's choice is being used as a reason to end the relationship, it's important to consider if the issue is about real incompatibility or personal preference. Since the author is okay with other scenarios where he might be uncomfortable, like an injury, but not with the nose ring, it might be more about his personal preferences rather than an actual incompatibility. That could make him the asshole because he's not being consistent in supporting his partner through difficult situations.\n\nSo, considering all this, I lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's imposing his personal discomfort as a dealbreaker without considering consistency and respect for her autonomy, which might be controlling.\n"
