We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about a nose ring ultimatum in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings to the point of considering it a dealbreaker. They told their girlfriend that if she gets one, they would break up. The girlfriend feels controlled and that the author is making a judgment about her body.\n\nI should consider relationship dynamics. In healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's autonomy. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be in a relationship where they're uncomfortable. But is it reasonable to break up over body modification? It depends on how significant the issue is. The author says they don't judge others with nose rings, which shows they're not against them in general. But in their relationship, it's a dealbreaker.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the author is controlling. She's asserting her right to modify her body as she chooses. The author agrees she should control her body but then uses that to justify breaking up if she does something that makes them uncomfortable. That contradiction might be the key here. The author is allowing her autonomy in principle but not accepting her choice in practice, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nThe girlfriend's hypothetical about an injury makes the author think about support. The author's comparison between a choice (nose ring) and an injury (uncontrollable) is important. The author might see the choice as something they can walk away from, while an injury is different. But the girlfriend sees both as things the author can't control and shouldn't use to end the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are prioritizing their own comfort over their partner's autonomy. While it's valid to have a dealbreaker, the line between personal preference and controlling behavior can be thin. The author might not be in the wrong if they're honest about their limits, but some might argue it's controlling. However, the fact that they tried to communicate and the girlfriend didn't agree leads to conflict. The answer might hinge on whether a dealbreaker over a body modification is reasonable. In some cases, yes, it's acceptable if it's a genuine dealbreaker. But others might think it's not their place to dictate such choices. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they communicated honestly, but there's a valid argument the other way. However, in many relationship advice contexts, controlling behavior is frowned upon even if it's a personal preference. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing their discomfort on their partner's body autonomy. But I need to check again. The author is not saying she can't get a nose ring, but that if she does, he can't be in the relationship. That's a dealbreaker, which is a personal choice. However, if the issue is about controlling her body, then it's a problem. The key is whether the author is being controlling. Since the author is allowing her to make the choice but ending the relationship if she does, it's a matter of whether the author's limits are reasonable. It's a tough call. Some might say it's their right to have dealbreakers. Others might see it as controlling. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes, they are in the wrong. If it's B, no. Given that the author is honest and the girlfriend doesn't agree, but the author's stance is about their own comfort, it's possible that the answer is A. Because respecting autonomy is important, and making a breakup conditional on a body modification choice could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
