We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author giving their girlfriend an ultimatum regarding getting a nose ring. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend that if she gets one, he can't be in a relationship with her. They've been together two years and live together. The girlfriend argues that this is controlling and that she should have autonomy over her body. The author says they agree she should be in charge of her body but sees it as a dealbreaker.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about personal autonomy versus personal comfort. The author is making a decision based on their own discomfort, but the girlfriend feels it's controlling. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are common. People have different boundaries and values. If getting a nose ring is important to the girlfriend, but the author can't accept it, that might be a legitimate dealbreaker. However, the line between a dealbreaker and being controlling can be thin. \n\nThe author's argument is that they're not controlling, they're just setting a boundary. But the girlfriend's point is about bodily autonomy. The author might be overstepping by making it a dealbreaker. However, if the author is honest about this from the start, it's their right to choose their comfort level. \n\nThe example the girlfriend gives about a medical condition causing discomfort is a good counter. The author says they'd support her in that case, but in this case, it's a choice she makes. The difference here is that a medical condition isn't under her control, whereas a nose ring is a choice. So the author's argument that it's different could be valid. But the girlfriend's point is about autonomy and control.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different views on body modification. The author's discomfort is personal, but using that to end a relationship could be seen as extreme. Yet, if the author is clear about their boundaries and the girlfriend proceeds, then both are at fault. But the post is from the author's perspective, so we need to assess if the author is wrong for making it a dealbreaker.\n\nThe key here is whether it's reasonable. If the author has never had this issue before and suddenly it becomes a dealbreaker, that might be controlling. But if they've always found nose rings gross and communicated that, and the girlfriend is now choosing to go against that, the author's stance could be seen as valid. However, in a healthy relationship, both parties should respect each other's choices unless it's a core value. Since body modification is personal style, making it a dealbreaker might be seen as the author being inflexible. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is wrong) because they're using their personal preference as a dealbreaker, which could be seen as controlling. However, if it's a core value for the author, it's not necessarily wrong. The line is blurry here. The example with the medical condition shows that the author is okay with discomfort in certain situations but not others. That inconsistency might show the author is being unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
