We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings and sees it as a dealbreaker. They told their girlfriend that if she gets one, they might break up. The girlfriend feels it's controlling, and there's some back and forth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author loves their girlfriend but can't get over the discomfort nose rings cause. They don't want to be controlling but feel it's a dealbreaker. On the other hand, the girlfriend wants autonomy over her body and feels the ultimatum is unfair. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is important. The author isn't preventing her from getting a nose ring, but making it a condition for staying in the relationship. That could be seen as controlling because it's about personal choice and body autonomy. However, if nose rings are a genuine dealbreaker for them, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But is it reasonable to break up over something that's about personal appearance and not a core value? \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypothetical injury is a good point. The author might be inconsistent if they wouldn't leave over a non-choice injury. That could show hypocrisy, making the author's stance seem less about genuine discomfort and more about control. \n\nBut then again, people have different triggers and boundaries. If nose rings are a dealbreaker, maybe it's not wrong for the author to act on their feelings. However, setting such a condition might not respect the girlfriend's autonomy. The key is whether the author is being controlling or setting a personal boundary. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author is setting a personal boundary, which is okay, but framing it as an ultimatum might be problematic because it's about body autonomy. So maybe the author is partially at fault. But the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn some cases, people have boundaries about physical appearance, but it's important to weigh that against the other person's rights. Since the author isn't forcing her not to get it but is making it a dealbreaker, it's a tough call. However, in relationships, it's important to support each other's choices unless they affect the relationship's core values. Body piercings are personal choices, so the author might be overstepping. So I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
