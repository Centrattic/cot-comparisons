We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they're really grossed out by nose rings and made it a dealbreaker. They told their girlfriend that if she got a nose ring, they'd break up. The girlfriend felt controlled and argued that she should have autonomy over her body. The author tried to explain that it's a matter of comfort, but the girlfriend compared it to supporting her in other difficult situations.\n\nSo, considering relationship dynamics, autonomy is a big factor. People have the right to make choices about their own bodies. The author is prioritizing their own discomfort over their partner's autonomy, which can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's argument about being supportive in other scenarios makes sense\u2014there's a difference between personal preference and something that affects the partner's well-being. The author is using their feelings as a reason to dictate another person's choice, which isn't fair. \n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily wrong for having a strong reaction. It's their body they're dealing with, and their feelings are valid. But in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's autonomy unless it's a matter of health or safety. Since a nose ring is a personal choice and not harmful, the author making it a dealbreaker seems more about their own discomfort than a legitimate issue. \n\nSo, while the author isn't malicious, their stance could be seen as controlling because they're using the breakup threat over a personal preference. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting autonomy is crucial, and making it a dealbreaker without a valid reason can be seen as controlling. However, it's a tricky situation where personal comfort is involved. But ultimately, the key point is that the girlfriend's body autonomy should be respected, and the author's ultimatum is imposing their preference, which isn't acceptable.\n"
