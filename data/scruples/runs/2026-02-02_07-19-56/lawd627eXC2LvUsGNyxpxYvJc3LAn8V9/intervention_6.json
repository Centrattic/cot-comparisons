We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author says they're really grossed out by nose rings and made it a dealbreaker. They live together and had a big argument about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves their girlfriend but finds nose rings deeply uncomfortable. They told her she shouldn't get one, and if she does, they'd break up. The girlfriend feels it's controlling, as she should control her own body. The author argues they're not trying to control her, just being honest about their feelings. The girlfriend brought up a hypothetical about an injury, which the author admitted they wouldn't break up over, leading her to feel hypocritical.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. Dealbreakers are common, but they usually involve things like core values, trust, or abuse. A nose ring is a personal choice about body modification. The author is making a personal preference a dealbreaker, which can be controversial. The girlfriend's autonomy over her body is a significant point. The author might not be wrong for having strong feelings, but forcing a breakup over a personal choice could be seen as controlling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's argument is that controlling her body choice is controlling. The author says they agree she should control her body but then makes a condition. That contradiction might be the issue. Also, the hypothetical about injury shows that the author's discomfort isn't the main issue in that scenario, but in the nose ring case, it is. That inconsistency could support the girlfriend's point about hypocrisy.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. While the author has the right to express their discomfort, making it a dealbreaker could be seen as prioritizing their own preferences over the partner's autonomy. However, if it's a genuine dealbreaker, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. But the way it's presented as an ultimatum without compromise might be problematic. The girlfriend's right to make her own choices is a strong point here.\n\nSo, balancing both sides. The answer might hinge on whether a personal preference can be a valid dealbreaker. If the author is willing to leave over this, it's their choice, but if they're not controlling or abusive, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fact that they're causing a breakup over a non-harmful, personal choice might make them the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because making a personal preference a dealbreaker without room for compromise can be seen as controlling and prioritizing one's own comfort over the partner's autonomy. The hypothetical scenario shows that the author can be supportive in other uncomfortable situations, so the nose ring issue might not be a valid dealbreaker in the same way.\n"
