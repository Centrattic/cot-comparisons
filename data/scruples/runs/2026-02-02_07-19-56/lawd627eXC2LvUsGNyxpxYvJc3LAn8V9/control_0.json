We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been dating for two years and live together. They usually get along well, but this recent argument is causing friction. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and told his girlfriend that if she gets one, he might break up with her. The girlfriend feels controlled and upset because she believes she should have autonomy over her body. The author argues that it's a dealbreaker for him, even though he agrees she should have control over her body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key points are personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing a personal dislike that's strong enough to be a dealbreaker. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels her autonomy is being compromised. \n\nIn relationships, both partners have the right to express their feelings and set boundaries. However, when those boundaries involve physical autonomy, like body modifications, it can be a sensitive issue. The author isn't trying to control her body, but his reaction is causing her to feel that way. The girlfriend's argument about hypothetical scenarios (like injury) is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the author's stance. If he would stay with her despite an injury, why can't he accept a nose ring? The author's response is that the situations feel different to him, but he can see her point.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important. However, making a body modification a dealbreaker might be seen as controlling if it's not a matter of safety or health. The girlfriend's autonomy is a significant factor here. While the author has the right to his preferences, using them as an ultimatum can be seen as infringing on her rights. It's also worth considering if this is a non-negotiable issue that neither side can compromise on, which is common in relationships. But if the author is unwilling to accept a choice that doesn't harm him, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did try to explain his feelings, but the girlfriend felt controlled. The author's response to her hypothetical scenario shows he's trying to understand her perspective, but maybe he didn't fully anticipate the impact of his ultimatum. The key here is whether the ultimatum is a form of control or a genuine dealbreaker. If it's the latter, he's not wrong to set that boundary. However, if he's using it as a way to control her appearance, that's different. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise. If neither partner can adjust their stance, it might be a dealbreaker. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the nose ring isn't harmful, and the author's discomfort is personal, making it a dealbreaker could be seen as unreasonable. However, if it's a deep-seated issue for him, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the ultimatum is a form of control or a personal boundary. Since the author is allowing her to make the choice but is stating that he can't continue the relationship if she does, it's a personal boundary. However, because body autonomy is a strong right, the author might be overstepping. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's using a personal preference as a dealbreaker in a way that affects her autonomy. But some might argue B because he's being honest about his feelings. \n\nBut in relationship ethics, respecting autonomy is crucial. If the girlfriend feels controlled, and the author is making a personal preference a dealbreaker, that could be seen as the author being in the wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
