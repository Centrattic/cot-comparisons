We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the author, who's in a two-year relationship with their girlfriend, can't stand nose rings and told her that if she gets one, he might break up. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he's being controlling by making her choose between her body autonomy and the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They live together and generally have little friction, so this sudden argument must have been a shock. The author states that nose rings gross him out and that it's a dealbreaker. While he acknowledges her right to her body, he's using that right as a reason to end the relationship if she gets a nose ring.\n\nNow, the key point here is whether setting such a boundary is controlling or if it's a legitimate personal preference. On one hand, people have the right to set boundaries based on their comfort. If something like nose rings is a genuine dealbreaker for him, maybe it's okay. But on the other hand, making a partner choose between their self-expression and the relationship could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that supporting her in case of an injury would mean not breaking up, but here he's breaking up over a choice she's making. That seems hypocritical. The author's response is that the situations are different, but it's hard to see how. If his discomfort is leading him to break up, then maybe he's prioritizing his own feelings over her autonomy in both cases. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's given her an ultimatum\u2014either don't get a nose ring or he'll break up\u2014could be seen as controlling. Even if it's a dealbreaker, presenting it as an ultimatum without trying to find a compromise or understanding might be where he's wrong. \n\nRelationships require mutual respect and compromise. If he can't accept her decision to get a nose ring, even if he's uncomfortable, that might be a sign that he's not respecting her autonomy. However, if he's honest about his feelings and she respects that, maybe it's a valid boundary. But since he's using it as a dealbreaker without considering other possibilities (like her getting the ring anyway), it's a problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's using a personal preference as a reason to control his girlfriend's body choices and is not compromising. The act of breaking up over something that's a personal choice (as opposed to something that affects their relationship in a more functional way) could be seen as being controlling. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
