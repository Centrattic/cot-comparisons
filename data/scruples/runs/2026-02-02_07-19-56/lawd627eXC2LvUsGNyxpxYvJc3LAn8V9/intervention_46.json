We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting a nose ring, and the boyfriend giving her an ultimatum. The author says nose rings gross him out and that it's a dealbreaker. He mentions he doesn't want to be controlling but feels it's a boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together two years, lives together, and the issue came up after a dinner conversation. The boyfriend was honest about his feelings, which led to an argument. The girlfriend felt controlled, while the boyfriend insists it's about his comfort and that she should have autonomy over her body.\n\nThe main question is whether setting this as a dealbreaker is unreasonable. On one hand, everyone has personal boundaries, and it's valid to feel uncomfortable. But on the other hand, body autonomy is important. The boyfriend is essentially saying that a non-harmful, personal choice by his partner is a dealbreaker, which might be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about a hypothetical injury is a good point. If she were injured and he couldn't be comfortable, would he break up? The boyfriend says no, implying that supporting her is the right choice despite his discomfort. That seems like a double standard to the girlfriend. If the issue is about discomfort, why is it a dealbreaker for a choice but not for an injury? That inconsistency might be where the boyfriend is wrong.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reasoning that she should have autonomy over her body but then using that as a reason to break up seems contradictory. He's allowing her autonomy but then not accepting her choice. That could be seen as controlling because he's imposing his preferences as a condition for staying in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find compromises, especially on non-essential issues. If nose rings are a dealbreaker, maybe the boyfriend needs to reflect on why they're so bothersome and whether it's worth ending a two-year relationship over. However, if it's a genuine dealbreaker for him and he's communicated it respectfully, some might argue he's not in the wrong. But given the girlfriend's perspective and the potential for controlling behavior, the consensus often leans towards the person being in the wrong if they use a personal preference to dictate a partner's body choices.\n\nSo, based on these points, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the situation involves a personal choice that doesn't harm the partner, and using it as a dealbreaker could be seen as controlling.\n"
