We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting a nose ring, and the author giving her an ultimatum to get one or break up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says nose rings gross them out and it's a dealbreaker. They love their girlfriend but can't be in a relationship if she has one. The girlfriend feels controlled and that the author isn't respecting her autonomy over her body.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is usually important. The author is trying to communicate their discomfort, which is valid, but using an ultimatum might come off as controlling. The girlfriend's argument about hypothetical injury is a good point\u2014supporting her in that case is expected, but using that as a comparison shows a lack of consistency in the author's reasoning.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't judge others with nose rings, but here they're making it a dealbreaker in their relationship. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by making it a dealbreaker. While everyone has their boundaries, some might argue that body modifications like nose rings are personal choices and not valid reasons to break up a relationship unless there's a deeper issue.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a compromise and making it a dealbreaker. However, if the discomfort is genuine and they feel it's affecting their relationship, they might not be in the wrong for setting that boundary. But the way it's presented\u2014ultimatum and not considering the girlfriend's autonomy\u2014could tip the scales towards them being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because making a body modification a dealbreaker without compromise could be seen as controlling, and the girlfriend is right about her body autonomy. The author's reasoning about the hypothetical injury shows they might not be considering the girlfriend's perspective adequately.\n"
