We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, and they live together. He finds nose rings gross and uncomfortable. The girlfriend wants to get one, which leads to an argument. The author tells her that if she gets a nose ring, he can't be in a relationship with her. She feels controlled and says he's being hypocritical when she brings up the hypothetical of her being injured and him leaving as well. The author is confused because he doesn't want to be controlling but nose rings are a dealbreaker.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about personal autonomy versus relationship boundaries. The girlfriend is asserting her right to choose what she does with her body, which is a strong point. The author is saying that his discomfort is a dealbreaker, which might be a personal boundary. But is it reasonable?\n\nFirst, nose rings are a personal choice and a form of self-expression. It's her body, so she has the right to decide. The author's discomfort is valid, but is it enough to break up over? That's the question. The girlfriend's argument about being a dealbreaker for something she can control versus an injury she can't is a good point. If the author can't accept her choice to express herself in a way that's not harmful to him, does that make him controlling? \n\nOn the other hand, in relationships, partners do have certain dealbreakers. Maybe the author is being honest about his feelings. But the line between respecting each other's autonomy and having controlling behavior is thin here. If he's saying that her choice to get a nose ring would end the relationship, it seems like he's prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy, which could be controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid too. She's upset because he's making a condition that affects her body autonomy. Even if he says he agrees she should be in charge, his response is to end the relationship if she does something she wants. That seems like a conflict between his dealbreakers and her rights. \n\nThe author's reasoning about the hypothetical injury is interesting. He says he wouldn't leave her if she was injured and he found it uncomfortable. That shows he's willing to support her in that scenario, which is good. But when it's a choice she makes, he's not. That inconsistency might be the issue. \n\nIs it reasonable to consider nose rings a dealbreaker? That's subjective. Some people would find other things dealbreakers, like smoking or certain hobbies. But nose rings are non-harmful and a personal choice. So maybe the author is being overly controlling here. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author isn't compromising here; he's saying either she doesn't get the nose ring or they break up. The girlfriend is being denied her self-expression for his comfort. That could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his personal discomfort on his girlfriend's body autonomy. It's her choice to make, and his reaction is an overreaction, making him controlling rather than respecting her decision. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
