We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author mentions that nose rings gross them out and made them uncomfortable, so they told their girlfriend it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend felt controlled and argued that the author would support her if she were injured, even if it made them uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've been dating two years and live together. The author states they don't want to be controlling but find nose rings a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues that she should have autonomy over her body. The key point is whether the author is overstepping by making a body modification a dealbreaker.\n\nBody autonomy is a big issue here. The girlfriend has the right to decide what she does with her body, even if her partner is uncomfortable. However, the author is expressing their own feelings and boundaries. The problem arises when personal preferences start to infringe on a partner's autonomy. The author isn't forcing her to get a nose ring, but they are threatening to end the relationship if she does, which can be seen as coercive.\n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument about a hypothetical injury is valid. If the author would support her in that case, why not in this situation? Both scenarios involve the author being uncomfortable with the partner's appearance. The difference is that an injury isn't a choice, but a nose ring is. However, the principle of support during hardship versus enforcing personal preferences is different. Still, the ultimatum here is about enforcing a personal preference rather than supporting through a change.\n\nThe author's stance is based on personal discomfort, which is subjective. They are prioritizing their own feelings over the partner's autonomy. While it's okay to have preferences, making a dealbreaker out of a non-harmful body modification can be controlling. The author isn't wrong to feel uncomfortable, but using that as a reason to break up is where they might be in the wrong. The girlfriend's right to her body is a fundamental aspect of a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they are imposing their personal preferences as a dealbreaker without considering the partner's autonomy and the potential imbalance of power in the relationship.\n"
