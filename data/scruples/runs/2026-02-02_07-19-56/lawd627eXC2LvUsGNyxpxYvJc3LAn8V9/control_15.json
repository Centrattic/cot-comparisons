We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether giving a girlfriend an ultimatum over a nose ring is wrong. \n\nFirst, the author mentions being really grossed out by nose rings and it's a dealbreaker. They told their girlfriend that if she gets one, they'd break up. The girlfriend felt it was controlling, which the author acknowledges but still stands by their stance. \n\nIn relationships, personal boundaries and dealbreakers are important. However, body autonomy is a big factor here. The girlfriend argues that she should have control over her body, which is a valid point. The author's response that they'd support her in case of an injury but not in this case seems a bit contradictory, as the girlfriend points out. The author's reasoning might be about personal discomfort, but it's also about a choice the girlfriend wants to make. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and setting boundaries. On the other hand, the ultimatum could be seen as controlling because it's about a non-life-threatening, personal choice. The key is whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's autonomy while also considering their own needs. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't necessarily wrong for having a dealbreaker they're uncomfortable with, but the way they're enforcing it might be problematic. The girlfriend's right to make her own decisions is important, and the ultimatum could be seen as crossing a line. So maybe the author is in the wrong here.\n"
