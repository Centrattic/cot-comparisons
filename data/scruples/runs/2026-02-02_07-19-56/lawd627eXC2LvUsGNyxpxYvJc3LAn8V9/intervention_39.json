We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for giving his girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author says he's really grossed out by nose rings and that it's a dealbreaker, so he told his girlfriend if she got one, they'd break up. The girlfriend is upset, feeling controlled, and argues that he would support her in other situations, which she sees as hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are personal body autonomy versus personal comfort in a relationship. The author is setting a boundary based on his feelings, but his girlfriend feels her autonomy is being violated. Body autonomy is a significant right; people should have control over their own bodies. However, relationships involve mutual compromise and communication. The author states that he respects her autonomy but uses that as a reason to break up, which might come off as controlling because he's making a decision based on his discomfort rather than her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy is interesting. She's pointing out that if she were injured and he found that uncomfortable, he'd support her. That's a valid point because accepting each other's flaws and supporting through hardships is part of a relationship. But the author is differentiating between a choice (getting a nose ring) and an injury (unintended). However, the line between choice and personal autonomy is blurry here. Choosing a nose ring is her expression, while an injury is beyond her control. Still, the author is using his personal discomfort as a dealbreaker, which might not be fair because it's her body choice.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if setting such a boundary is reasonable. It's possible that the author could have found a compromise or discussed it more, but instead, he made an ultimatum. Ultimatums can be controlling, especially if they're based on personal preferences rather than core values. If nose rings are a dealbreaker, maybe the author should reflect on whether they're worth the relationship. On the other hand, if it's causing genuine distress, there's merit in him communicating that. But the way he presented it as an ultimatum without compromise could be seen as wrong.\n\nAnother angle: in healthy relationships, partners shouldn't use breakups as leverage over body autonomy. The author is prioritizing his comfort over her autonomy in a superficial matter, which might not be justifiable. However, if the discomfort is real and significant, it's understandable. But it's about whether the response is appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because body autonomy is a big deal. The author didn't offer alternatives or try to work through the discomfort, just an ultimatum.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's making a decision that affects someone else's autonomy based on his personal preferences without sufficient compromise. But there's also a case for his right to his own comfort. However, the key issue is the ultimatum and the control aspect. Hence, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
