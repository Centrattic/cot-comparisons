We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is grossed out by nose rings and told his girlfriend that if she gets one, he can't be in a relationship with her. The girlfriend feels like this is controlling, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves his girlfriend but finds nose rings extremely uncomfortable. He told her she should do what she wants, but if she gets a nose ring, he can't be with her. That's a big deal because it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend is upset because she feels like he's controlling her body choices, which is her right. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, people have different boundaries. If something is a dealbreaker, it's not necessarily wrong to say so. For example, if someone had a strong issue with smoking and it was a dealbreaker, they could say that. However, the line between personal boundaries and control can be thin. \n\nThe author's stance is that he can't be in a relationship with her if she has a nose ring. That's a significant demand because it's about her body autonomy. On the other hand, he did express that he supports her body autonomy in general, but the specific issue here is a dealbreaker. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to break up over something that doesn't affect him physically but just makes him uncomfortable? The girlfriend argues that if she were injured, he'd support her, so why is this different? The author's response is that it's a different situation. However, the girlfriend's right to choose her body is a fundamental part of her identity. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is respecting her autonomy. If he can't accept her choice in this matter, even though it's about her body, then he's imposing his preferences as a dealbreaker, which could be seen as controlling. But if it's genuinely a dealbreaker for him, then he's being honest about his limitations. \n\nThe problem arises when personal preferences become dealbreakers that disregard the other person's autonomy. Since a nose ring is a personal choice and not harmful to him, making it a dealbreaker might be unreasonable. However, if he's honest about this before the relationship is too deep, it's his right. But since they've been together two years, maybe it's too late, and he's causing unnecessary friction. \n\nIn the end, the author is prioritizing his own discomfort over her autonomy. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's being asked to sacrifice part of her identity for his comfort. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's using a personal preference as a dealbreaker without considering that her choice is about her own body.\n"
