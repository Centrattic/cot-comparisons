We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that the author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend that if she gets one, they would break up. The girlfriend felt controlled and argued that the author is being hypocritical because they wouldn't break up over an injury that affects her appearance.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about personal boundaries, autonomy, and whether breaking up over a nose ring is a controlling move. The author says they don't judge others with nose rings but find them uncomfortable. However, they're using it as a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues that she should have control over her body and that the author is being controlling.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, people have the right to their own preferences in a relationship. If someone is really uncomfortable with something, it's their choice to seek a partner who's okay with it. On the other hand, making someone choose between their body autonomy and the relationship might be seen as controlling, especially if the reason is purely aesthetic. The girlfriend's point about supporting her in case of injury is a good counterargument. The author's discomfort over a nose ring versus a medical condition might not be the same, but the argument is about whether the author can impose their preferences without being controlling.\n\nI think the author is in a tough spot. They genuinely feel that the presence of a nose ring would make them uncomfortable, but using a breakup as an ultimatum because of a personal preference could be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend's right to her body is a strong point. While the author isn't forcing her to do anything, setting a breakup condition based on a non-negotiable preference might be controlling. The fact that they can't see the hypocrisy in their argument (as the girlfriend points out) suggests a lack of consideration for her autonomy. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
