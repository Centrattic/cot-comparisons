We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's really grossed out by nose rings and gave his girlfriend an ultimatum. He says it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend is upset because he's being controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy is honest about his feelings and how nose rings make him uncomfortable. He's communicated this to his girlfriend and even acknowledges that others might find them nice. He loves her but says it's a dealbreaker. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels her autonomy is being invaded. She argues that she should have control over her body, which is a valid point.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The guy did talk about his feelings, but he's essentially setting a condition on their relationship based on a physical attribute she wants to express. That could be seen as controlling because he's imposing his discomfort on her decision. However, relationships do involve compromise, and if this is a genuine dealbreaker for him, maybe it's not entirely his fault.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypothetical scenarios, like if she were injured, is a good point. He says he wouldn't leave her in that case, which highlights inconsistency. If he can accept supporting her through injury, why can't he accept a nose ring she wants for personal expression? That makes him look a bit hypocritical. \n\nBut then again, personal preferences can be strong. The question is whether it's fair to use that as a dealbreaker. If it's a matter of personal taste, maybe it's not reasonable to end the relationship over it. However, if it's causing him significant discomfort and he's communicated that, there's a balance between his feelings and her autonomy. \n\nI think the issue is that he's prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy without considering alternatives. Maybe they could find a middle ground, like her getting a nose ring that's less noticeable to him, or him working on his discomfort. By giving her an ultimatum instead of seeking compromise, he's being controlling. So, the author is in the wrong because he's using his feelings as a dealbreaker without sufficient compromise or respect for her autonomy.\n"
