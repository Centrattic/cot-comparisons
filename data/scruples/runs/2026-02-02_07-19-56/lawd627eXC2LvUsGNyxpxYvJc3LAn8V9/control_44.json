We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting a nose ring, and the author giving her an ultimatum to break up if she gets one. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. They mentioned they don't judge others but it's a personal dealbreaker. The girlfriend feels controlled since she should have autonomy over her body. The author argues that they respect her autonomy but can't be in a relationship if she has a nose ring.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about a hypothetical injury causing discomfort is interesting. The author said they wouldn't break up if she was injured, but in this case, it's a choice. Maybe the difference is that an injury isn't her choice, whereas the nose ring is. So the author isn't being hypocritical because they aren't controlling her in the injury scenario.\n\nBut then, is it fair to break up over a body modification that doesn't affect the relationship otherwise? The author says it's a dealbreaker, which is their personal boundary. However, relationships require negotiation. If the girlfriend wants something that's a dealbreaker for the partner, maybe the author is using their autonomy to prevent her from making a choice. \n\nOn the other hand, if the discomfort is genuine and it's a dealbreaker, the author isn't controlling but setting their own limits. People do have different dealbreakers. But the girlfriend's autonomy is important. The author isn't saying she can't get a nose ring unless she leaves, but that if she does get one, they can't continue. That might be seen as respecting her choice but also their own limits. \n\nBut is it controlling? If the author is pressuring her to not get the nose ring, but in this case, they told her she can get it, but then break up. That's a bit of a paradox. By making it a dealbreaker, they are using their autonomy to avoid something that's a personal choice for her. However, if it's truly a dealbreaker, maybe it's not about controlling but about their own well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's point about supporting her in an injury is valid, but that's a different scenario. Injuries are involuntary, while a nose ring is a choice. So the author isn't being hypocritical. However, if the author's reaction to her getting a nose ring is similar to how they'd react to an injury, but in reality, they wouldn't break up over an injury, that's a conflict. But the author clarifies they wouldn't break up over an injury because they'd support her. So in the nose ring case, it's a voluntary choice, which is different. \n\nThe key is whether it's reasonable to have such a dealbreaker. Some people might find it unreasonable to break up over a body modification that's a form of self-expression. However, others might say that if it's a genuine dealbreaker, the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. \n\nIn terms of the question of being controlling, if the author is not forcing her to remove it but allowing her to choose and then walk away if she does, that's not controlling. It's about their own limits. However, if the author is making it a condition to prevent her from getting the nose ring, that could be controlling. But in the scenario, the author says she can get it, but then they'll break up. So it's not controlling, but setting a boundary. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. If the author is being honest and respectful, and the girlfriend is being honest about her wants, maybe it's a matter of incompatible values. The author isn't controlling but is honest about their limits. However, some might argue that the author is prioritizing their discomfort over their partner's autonomy. \n\nBut given that the author is allowing her to make the choice and then walking away, rather than trying to prevent her from getting the nose ring, it's more about their own dealbreaker. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, others might say that the author is being inconsiderate, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they are being honest and respecting her autonomy, even if it leads to a breakup, they aren't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
