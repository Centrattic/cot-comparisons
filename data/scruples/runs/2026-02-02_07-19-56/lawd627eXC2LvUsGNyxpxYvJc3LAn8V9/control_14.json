We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author giving their girlfriend an ultimatum regarding getting a nose ring.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. They told their girlfriend this, and she wanted to get one anyway. The author then made it a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup. The girlfriend felt controlled, while the author argues that it's about their own comfort.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, it's common for people to have dealbreakers based on personal preferences. However, the line between personal preference and controlling behavior can be blurry. The author's stance is that they love their girlfriend but can't be in a relationship with her if she has a nose ring. The girlfriend argues about bodily autonomy, which is a valid point.\n\nThe counterargument from the girlfriend is about hypothetical scenarios, like if she were injured. The author's response here might highlight a contradiction, but it's a different context. Injuries aren't a choice, unlike body modifications. The author's discomfort is real, but using it as an ultimatum might be seen as controlling. However, in long-term relationships, personal boundaries are part of the dynamic. If both partners can't compromise, it's a valid reason to part ways, even if it's about something like a nose ring.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is a reasonable expression of their boundaries or if it's overstepping. Since the author is honest about their feelings and the girlfriend is respecting their choice by considering breaking up, it's a mutual decision. The author isn't forcing her to remove a nose ring but is stating their own dealbreaker. So, while it might be a tough call, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they're clear and honest about their limits. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
