We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with a girlfriend they live with. They usually don't have much conflict, but this nose ring thing is causing a big argument. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. The girlfriend wants one. The author says they don't judge others with nose rings but find them unappealing. They told the girlfriend that if she gets a nose ring, he would be uncomfortable being in the relationship. The girlfriend feels controlled and argues that he should respect her autonomy over her body. She also brings up a hypothetical about her being injured and whether he'd leave her then, which he says he wouldn't, leading her to accuse him of hypocrisy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by making this ultimatum. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let me consider the key points. The author is expressing a strong personal dislike for nose rings. He acknowledges it's a dealbreaker for him, so he's not just being superficial but is prioritizing his own comfort. However, the girlfriend is asserting her right to make decisions about her body. The author's stance is that he can't be in the relationship if she gets a nose ring, which seems like a significant condition.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are things that one person can't compromise on. But the question is whether this is a reasonable dealbreaker. Body modifications like piercings are personal choices, and unless it's something that directly affects the other person's health or safety, it's more about personal preference. The author's discomfort is aesthetic, which can be a valid feeling, but is it fair to use that as a dealbreaker?\n\nThe girlfriend argues that the author is being controlling. Control in a relationship is about one person's decisions affecting the other's autonomy. If the author is trying to prevent her from making a choice about her own body, that could be seen as controlling. However, the author is also stating that his own feelings are a factor\u2014if he can't be comfortable in the relationship, then maybe he's not being fair either.\n\nThe hypothetical she brings up is interesting. If she were injured and he wouldn't leave her, but in this case he would, that does highlight a possible inconsistency. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over her autonomy in a situation where her choice isn't a health issue. It's about the difference between something she chooses versus something she can't control, but the author's response to the hypothetical might not address the core issue: his personal dislike versus her right to choose.\n\nIt's possible that the author is overstepping by making a body decision a dealbreaker. Relationships require compromise, and if one person's personal preference is so strong that it can't be compromised, it may indicate a problem. On the other hand, if the author's discomfort is genuine and affects their relationship, it's a valid concern. But the key here is that the girlfriend's decision doesn't harm him, unless he can't handle the visual aspect. That seems more about personal taste than something that should dictate the relationship's future.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his personal aesthetic preferences as a dealbreaker, which could be seen as controlling and doesn't respect her autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her body, and the author's reaction is more about his own discomfort than any real harm. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
