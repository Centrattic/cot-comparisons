We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and told the girlfriend they can't be in a relationship if she gets one. The girlfriend felt it was controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are mutual respect in a relationship, autonomy over one's body, and whether the author's stance is a reasonable boundary or overstepping. The author mentions they don't want to be controlling but believe it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues it's about her body, which is a valid point.\n\nIn relationships, it's common to have differing levels of acceptance for each other's choices. However, making something a dealbreaker can be problematic if it's not an actual dealbreaker. The author's reasoning is based on personal discomfort rather than something harmful. The girlfriend's right to modify her body is a significant factor here. \n\nThe argument that the author would support her if she were injured but not if she chooses a nose ring seems like a distinction without a meaningful difference. Both situations involve discomfort, but one is a choice and the other is an accident. However, the author might view them differently, but that could still be seen as inconsistent.\n\nThe girlfriend felt controlled, which is a valid emotional response. The author's ultimatum is a form of control, even if stated as a personal preference. Relationships require negotiation, and if one partner's comfort level is so high that it leads to breaking up over a body modification, it's a big decision. However, the author isn't forcing her to do something; they're stating their own limitations. \n\nBut the line between setting a boundary and being controlling can be thin. If the author genuinely finds it unmanageable, it's their choice to leave, but it's important to check if this is a legitimate boundary or a way to exert control. Since the author acknowledges the girlfriend's autonomy but still sets the ultimatum, it's a bit of a contradiction. They want to respect her autonomy but are making a decision that affects their relationship based on their discomfort. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, body modifications are a personal choice, and partners shouldn't impose restrictions unless it's part of a mutual agreement. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing their own feelings over their partner's wishes, which might be considered selfish. But at the same time, the author is honest about their feelings and isn't hiding it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ultimatum is justified. If it's a genuine dealbreaker for the author, they aren't necessarily wrong, but the way they presented it might be controlling. However, in relationships, people have to make compromises. The key is whether the author is willing to work through discomfort or if they're using it as a reason to dictate their partner's choices. Since the author says they don't want to be controlling but still issues an ultimatum, it's more on the side of being controlling. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
