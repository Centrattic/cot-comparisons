We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author giving their girlfriend an ultimatum regarding a nose ring.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is deeply uncomfortable with nose rings, to the point of being grossed out. They've communicated this to their girlfriend, who then expresses a desire to get one. The author's response is to say that if she does get a nose ring, he can't be in a relationship with her. That's a pretty severe reaction, essentially a dealbreaker.\n\nThe girlfriend reacts by feeling controlled and brings up a hypothetical about her being injured and the author supporting her. The author acknowledges that point but still stands by their position. \n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries, personal autonomy, and mutual respect. The girlfriend's right to modify her body is a significant factor here. Body autonomy is a fundamental right, and pressuring someone not to do something that's their personal choice can be seen as controlling. However, the author's discomfort is real and valid for them. But the key issue is whether the ultimatum is a reasonable boundary or if it oversteps.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are things that one person can't live with. However, when the dealbreaker is something that affects the other person's autonomy, it's tricky. The author is prioritizing their own comfort over the girlfriend's autonomy, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy\u2014if she were injured and he still stayed, but with a nose ring he breaks up\u2014is a valid point. It suggests that his reaction isn't about her well-being but his own discomfort, which could be a red flag about controlling behavior.\n\nHowever, the author did acknowledge her right to choose her body, which shows some awareness. The problem is enforcing a breakup based on a personal preference that doesn't directly harm him. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they're making a choice that affects the girlfriend's autonomy based on their own aversion, which isn't a sufficient reason to end a relationship. But some might argue that if it's a dealbreaker for the author, they are not at fault for prioritizing their own well-being.\n\nBut generally, relationships require compromise. If the author can't get past their discomfort, maybe the problem isn't the girlfriend's choice but the author's inability to accept her for who she is. That could be a deeper issue. So, in terms of being controlling, the author might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer leans towards \"A\" (the author is in the wrong).\n"
