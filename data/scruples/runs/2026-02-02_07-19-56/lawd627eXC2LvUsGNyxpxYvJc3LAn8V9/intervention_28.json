We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving his girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author says he's really grossed out by nose rings and they make him uncomfortable. He and his girlfriend live together and have been dating two years. They don't usually argue much, but this came up after dinner. He told her he didn't want her to get a nose ring, and she wanted to. He agreed she's in charge of her body but said it would be a dealbreaker. She got upset, thinking he was controlling. He then asked for a sanity check.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether his reaction is controlling or a valid dealbreaker. On one hand, the author is expressing his genuine feelings about something that disgusts him. He's not forcing her to do anything, but he's saying if she does get it, he'll break up. On the other hand, it's her body, and she has autonomy. The argument she made about being injured is a good point\u2014supporting her in difficult times is expected, but she's choosing to get a nose ring, which is a personal choice. However, the author feels it's a dealbreaker because it's about his comfort. \n\nI think it's complicated. If both people in a relationship have to make compromises, is this a fair request? The author is not trying to harm her but is prioritizing his own comfort. But is it okay to break up over someone's body modification choice? The girlfriend's autonomy is important. Maybe the author is being a bit controlling by making it a dealbreaker, unless there's a deeper reason (like a past trauma or something). But as presented, it's just personal discomfort. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's making a choice that affects her autonomy based on his own discomfort. But some might argue that in a relationship, both have dealbreakers. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he's using a personal preference as a dealbreaker, which could be seen as controlling. However, others might say it's his right to set boundaries. But since the question is asking if he's in the wrong, and considering the autonomy aspect, maybe A is the answer.\n"
