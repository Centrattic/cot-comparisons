We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing over a nose ring. The author says they're grossed out by nose rings and made an ultimatum to their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt it was controlling. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they love their girlfriend but find nose rings uncomfortable. They told her she should get one if she wants, but it would make them uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she does. That sounds like a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argued that the author is controlling, and the author tried to counter by comparing it to an injury scenario.\n\nHmm. So, in relationships, personal choices like body modifications can be a point of contention. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by making it a dealbreaker. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her own body, and the author is essentially saying that their comfort overrides her autonomy. But at the same time, the author is not forcing her to do anything; they're just stating that their comfort level requires her to not get a nose ring. However, making it a dealbreaker might be seen as controlling because it's a significant decision that affects both parties.\n\nThe girlfriend's point about being in charge of her body is important. If the author is willing to accept her if she were injured (even if that makes them uncomfortable), but not accept a choice she makes voluntarily, that inconsistency might highlight the author's hypocrisy. The author's discomfort is a personal preference, but it's not something that directly harms the relationship unless it's causing constant conflict. However, the author is willing to end the relationship over it, which is a big step.\n\nOn the other hand, people in relationships often have to compromise. If the author can't be comfortable with their partner's choice, maybe it's a genuine dealbreaker. But the question is whether that makes the author in the wrong. If the author is being respectful and not forcing the issue, but just stating their limits, maybe they aren't the asshole. But setting such a hard line might be seen as controlling, especially if the partner feels pressured not to express their own identity.\n\nI think the author's stance is problematic because they're prioritizing their own discomfort over their partner's autonomy in a non-harmful choice. It's their body, and unless there's a valid reason (like health issues), the author shouldn't dictate that. The ultimatum seems controlling. So, probably answer A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
