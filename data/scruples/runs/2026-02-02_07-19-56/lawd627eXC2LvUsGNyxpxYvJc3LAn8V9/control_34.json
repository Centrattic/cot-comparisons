We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about a guy who gave his girlfriend an ultimatum about getting a nose ring. He's really grossed out by them and says it's a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup threat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that he's uncomfortable with nose rings and can't be in a relationship if she gets one. He mentions he supports her autonomy in other cases, like if she were injured, but that's different. His girlfriend feels controlled and that he's using her body against her. \n\nNow, in relationships, dealbreakers are common. People have things they can't compromise on. But where it gets tricky is when it's about personal choices like body modifications. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by making this a dealbreaker. \n\nHe says he respects her autonomy, but then uses that as a reason to break up. There's a contradiction there. If she has the right to choose her body, then his reaction might be controlling. But he's also being honest about his feelings. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially if it's a personal choice not affecting him directly. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about being in charge of her body is valid. If the author can't accept that, maybe the issue is his own discomfort rather than her choice. The example he gives about an injury is different because it's not a choice. She's pointing out a hypocrisy, which might be a fair point. \n\nOn the other hand, in a healthy relationship, both partners should have dealbreakers. But when it comes to non-harmful personal choices, making them dealbreakers can be problematic. It might indicate that the author's feelings are more about his own biases than respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's imposing his personal discomfort onto his girlfriend's right to modify her body. However, some might argue that if it's a genuine dealbreaker for him, it's not entirely his fault. But the way he's framing it as a control issue and not just a personal preference could make him wrong. The answer might depend on cultural context too, but generally, respecting body autonomy is important. So leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
