We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend have been dating for two years, living together. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. Their girlfriend wants to get one. The author told her that if she got a nose ring, he couldn't be in the relationship. They had an argument, and the girlfriend felt controlled, while the author says they respect her autonomy but this is a dealbreaker. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is being honest about their feelings, which is important in a relationship. They don't want to be controlling, and they acknowledge the girlfriend's right to decide her own body. But at the same time, they are using this as a dealbreaker, which could be seen as controlling because they're saying they can't be in the relationship if she makes a choice that affects her own body. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's her body and she should have the freedom to make that choice. The author's ultimatum might be imposing their personal discomfort on her, which could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. The author's analogy of supporting her if she was injured is a valid point, but the difference is that getting a nose ring is a personal choice, whereas an injury is out of her control. However, the author might feel that the discomfort is significant enough to be a dealbreaker, but that could also depend on the strength of their feelings for her and their ability to manage that discomfort.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are personal, but they should be realistic and not infringe on the other person's autonomy. If the author's discomfort is so severe that they can't be in the relationship, maybe they need to evaluate whether that's their issue to handle, not the girlfriend's. However, it's also important to communicate boundaries. But if the author is truly okay with her making other choices about her body but not this one, that might be inconsistent.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy when comparing to an injury is a good point. If the author would stay with her despite her injury, why can't they handle a nose ring? The difference is that the injury isn't her choice, but the nose ring is. But the author might feel that the discomfort from the nose ring is more manageable or that they can't live with it, whereas supporting her through an injury is different. But that's subjective.\n\nIn terms of being controlling, if the author is allowing her to make other decisions about her body but this one is a dealbreaker, maybe it's not about control but about their personal limits. However, if the author is prioritizing their own comfort over her autonomy in a non-harmful decision, that could be problematic.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They are being honest, but their dealbreaker might be seen as overstepping. The key is whether the choice to get a nose ring harms the relationship in a way that's unreasonable. Since it's a personal aesthetic choice and doesn't affect the relationship's health, the author might be in the wrong by making it a dealbreaker. The girlfriend's right to autonomy is important, and the author should perhaps find a way to manage their discomfort rather than ending the relationship over it.\n"
