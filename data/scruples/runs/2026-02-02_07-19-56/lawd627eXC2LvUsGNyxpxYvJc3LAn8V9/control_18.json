We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the guy is in the wrong for giving his girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe guy says nose rings gross him out and make him uncomfortable. They've been dating two years, live together, and don't usually have much conflict. The argument came up when he mentioned his discomfort, and she wanted to get one. He told her it's a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup threat if she gets a nose ring. She felt controlled and that he's not respecting her autonomy over her body. He argues that he's not trying to control her, just that he can't be in a relationship where he's uncomfortable. She counters by asking if he'd leave her if she was injured, implying that his stance is inconsistent.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of control in a relationship. The guy is setting a boundary based on his personal preference, which is his right. However, when he frames it as a dealbreaker, it shifts from personal preference to a condition for staying in the relationship. That can be seen as controlling if it's about changing her appearance to fit his comfort level rather than addressing his own feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their body autonomy. By making her choice to get a nose ring a dealbreaker, he's essentially saying her decision about her body affects the continuation of their relationship. That's a significant power imbalance. It's about whether his discomfort justifies such a severe consequence. \n\nHe mentions he doesn't want to be controlling, but the ultimatum is a form of control. He's imposing his standard on her decision. However, he did present an option where he respects her choice but can't be with her, which shows he's considering her autonomy even if he's setting a boundary. \n\nThe girlfriend's comparison to supporting her in case of injury is a valid point. If he can support her through an injury he finds uncomfortable, why can't he support her choice to get a nose ring? This inconsistency might be a flaw in his reasoning. \n\nBut the key here is whether the nose ring is a personal choice versus an injury being an external event. The guy might feel that the nose ring is a choice they could avoid, whereas an injury is beyond control. However, the principle might still apply: can he accept her as she is, including her choices? \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries and dealbreakers, but when those dealbreakers relate to aspects of the other person's identity or autonomy, it can be problematic. The guy is prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy, which is a classic sign of a dealbreaker being a personal preference rather than a legitimate incompatibility. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the guy is likely in the wrong because he's using his personal discomfort to dictate her body decisions, which is controlling. However, the nuance is that he's not forbidding her from getting it but is choosing to end the relationship. That's a tough spot, but in terms of ethical standpoint, respecting her autonomy is more important than his discomfort. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
