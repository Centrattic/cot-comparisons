We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for giving his girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together two years, live together, and usually have little friction. The girlfriend wants a nose ring, and the guy says he's really grossed out by them. He told her it's a dealbreaker. She argues that he's being controlling, and he responded that he respects her autonomy but can't be in the relationship if she gets one. She's upset because he's using his discomfort as a reason to break up.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy versus personal boundaries. The guy is saying that his discomfort is a dealbreaker, which is his personal boundary. The girlfriend feels her autonomy is being violated because she's the one making the choice about her body. \n\nThe question is whether the guy is wrong. From a typical relationship advice perspective, people often say that you can't control someone else's body. However, if something is a dealbreaker for you, it's your right to communicate that. But there's a line between expressing a preference and making it a dealbreaker. \n\nIn this case, the guy is not trying to control her in an active way (like preventing her from getting it through force) but is saying that if she proceeds, he can't be in the relationship. That's a tough position because it's his personal preference affecting their relationship. The girlfriend's argument about the hypothetical injury is a common counterpoint\u2014why is her choice different from an injury? The guy's response is that supporting her through an injury is different from something she chooses. \n\nBut the problem is, if he's using his personal discomfort as a reason to end the relationship, is that fair? Some might say he should work through his discomfort for the sake of the relationship. Others might say that if it's a deep-seated issue and a dealbreaker, he's within his rights to prioritize his feelings. \n\nHowever, ultimatums like this can be seen as controlling because they force the other person to choose between their desires and the relationship. The key here is whether the guy is allowing her autonomy. He says he agrees she should be in charge of her body but can't be with her if she does it. That creates a conflict because respecting autonomy might mean respecting her choice even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nTypically, in such scenarios, the person making the ultimatum is considered at fault because they're making a personal preference a dealbreaker without considering the other's autonomy. Unless it's a matter of safety or health, personal appearance choices are usually seen as the individual's right. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's using his preference to control her body autonomy. But others might argue that relationships require compromise and that he's within his rights to set boundaries. \n\nBut the standard advice is that as long as the partner isn't harming the other, the other can't make it a dealbreaker. So, the author is being controlling and thus in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
