We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating two years, live together. The guy is really grossed out by nose rings and made it a dealbreaker. The girlfriend wanted to get one, which led to an argument. The guy said he'd break up if she got one, but then she challenged him by comparing it to an injury. He said he wouldn't leave her in that case, so she accused him of being hypocritical.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author (the guy) is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the key here? Well, the guy is stating his personal discomfort as a reason to end the relationship. But is it controlling? The girlfriend argues that she should have autonomy over her body. The guy does agree she should be in charge of her body, but then uses that to say he can't be in the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are usually about things that affect the relationship's viability. For example, if someone can't handle certain lifestyle choices that are important to the other person. But nose rings are a body modification that's a personal choice. The guy's issue is aesthetic and about his comfort. \n\nHowever, dealbreakers can vary. If he's truly certain that this is a dealbreaker, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he's phrased it, he's not just expressing discomfort but making it a condition for staying in the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is about autonomy. She's saying it's her body, which is a valid point. But the guy is also expressing his feelings. The question is whether his stance is controlling or just expressing his limits. \n\nThe comparison she made to an injury is interesting. If he wouldn't leave over an injury, why a nose ring? He says the situations feel different to him. But she's pointing out the inconsistency. Maybe he's being a bit hypocritical here, as both involve his discomfort, but one is her choice and the other isn't her fault. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different triggers. If nose rings are a dealbreaker for him, maybe it's not his fault. But is it fair to end a relationship over something so specific? Especially when it's about her self-expression. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. If it's purely about his comfort without any other factors (like health issues, etc.), then it's more about his personal preference. In that case, expecting the other person to change a significant part of their identity for his comfort could be seen as controlling. \n\nSo, the author is prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy. While it's okay to have personal preferences, making it a dealbreaker over something that doesn't affect the relationship's functionality (unlike, say, drug use or abuse) might make him the asshole. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
