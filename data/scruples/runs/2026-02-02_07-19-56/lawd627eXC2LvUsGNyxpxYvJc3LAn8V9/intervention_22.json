We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, and they live together. They usually don't have much conflict, but this nose ring issue has caused a big argument. The author says he's really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. When the topic came up, he told his girlfriend he didn't want her to get one. She wanted to get one, and he said it's a dealbreaker\u2014he would break up with her if she did. She felt he was being controlling. He tried to explain that he agrees she should have control over her body but that it makes him uncomfortable. She asked about a hypothetical where she's injured and he would support her, but he thinks it's different. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author finds nose rings personally uncomfortable and finds them gross, which is a dealbreaker. \n2. He communicated that to his girlfriend, leading to an argument. \n3. She felt he was being controlling. \n4. He tried to explain his position but still set a boundary. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider relationship dynamics, consent, and autonomy. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy, especially regarding their own bodies. The girlfriend is making a choice about her body, which is her right. The author's reaction is a personal preference, but setting a dealbreaker over something that isn't a health or safety issue can be seen as controlling. \n\nHowever, people do have dealbreakers in relationships, so if it's a genuine dealbreaker, is that wrong? The question is whether his reaction is justified. Since nose rings are a personal choice and not inherently harmful, the author is prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy\u2014if he would support her in an injury causing discomfort, then why not this? The author might feel it's different because one is a choice and the other isn't, but the girlfriend is arguing that both cause him discomfort. \n\nThe author's stance could be seen as controlling because he's making her body modification a condition for staying in the relationship. Even if he's not forcing her, by saying he would break up, he's using that as a threat to control her decision. \n\nOn the other hand, in any relationship, people have preferences and sometimes those can be dealbreakers for non-negotiable reasons. The question is whether that's reasonable here. If the issue is purely aesthetic and the author can't separate his feelings from the relationship, then it's a personal choice, but it does impose on her autonomy. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if he's being controlling by making her choice a dealbreaker, then he's in the wrong. But if it's a genuine dealbreaker that he's honest about, then it's a matter of compatibility. However, since the issue is about her body and not something that affects their relationship beyond aesthetics, it's more likely that the author is being controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's autonomy is important. The author is not wrong for having a preference, but when he turns it into a dealbreaker without considering the impact on her rights over her own body, he steps into controlling behavior. \n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
