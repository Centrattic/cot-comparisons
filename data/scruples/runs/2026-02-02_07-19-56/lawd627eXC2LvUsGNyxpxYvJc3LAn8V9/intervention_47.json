We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that the author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend they would break up if she got one. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels strongly that nose rings make them uncomfortable and see it as a dealbreaker. They love their girlfriend but can't get past this. On the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's controlling and that she should have autonomy over her body. She also points out the hypocrisy by asking if he'd break up if she were injured and looked different.\n\nSo, the key points here are autonomy versus personal discomfort. The author is setting a boundary based on their feelings, but the girlfriend feels it's a violation of her right to modify her body. In relationships, it's common to have differences in preferences, but when it becomes a dealbreaker, it's more complex. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being controlling. The author does acknowledge that the girlfriend should be in charge of her body but still insists that the nose ring is a dealbreaker. This might come off as controlling because it's imposing a personal preference into a decision that's otherwise the other person's choice. \n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument about injury is important. If the author would stay with her despite an injury that also causes discomfort, why is the nose ring different? The author might not see the comparison as valid because an injury isn't a choice, but the girlfriend sees both as things out of her control that the author is uncomfortable with. That could highlight a lack of consistency or empathy from the author.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has dealbreakers. Maybe the author is honest about their feelings and isn't forcing the issue beyond expressing their stance. They did give her the option to proceed, even though it's a breakup. So, there's a balance between respecting autonomy and personal limits.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're using a personal preference as a dealbreaker in a way that infringes on the girlfriend's autonomy. However, it's also valid to have personal boundaries. But the way it's framed as an ultimatum without compromise might make it controlling. The girlfriend's point about hypocrisy is a strong one. So, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted since relationships require both parties to make sacrifices.\n"
