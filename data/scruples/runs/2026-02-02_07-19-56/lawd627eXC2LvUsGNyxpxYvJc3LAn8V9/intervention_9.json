We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for giving his girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. \n\nFirst, the key points of the situation: The couple has been dating two years, lives together, and generally gets along. The girlfriend wants a nose ring, which the guy is really grossed out by. He told her that if she gets one, he'd break up with her. She felt it was controlling, and there was an argument.\n\nThe user, the person who wrote the question, thinks the author is in the wrong. They're asking for my opinion. I need to decide if the author was wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider the dynamics of the relationship. The man says it's a dealbreaker, but he also acknowledges that others might find nose rings nice. He argues that he's in favor of bodily autonomy. However, by making it a dealbreaker, he's imposing his discomfort onto his partner's choice. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's asserting her right to make decisions about her own body. The author's ultimatum could be seen as controlling, even if it's framed as respecting her autonomy. The comparison she makes to supporting her if she were injured is a good point. In that scenario, he wouldn't break up over her appearance changing due to an injury, but he would over a choice she makes. That inconsistency might make his stance seem hypocritical.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal boundaries. If nose rings genuinely make him uncomfortable and it's affecting their relationship, he has a right to express that. However, making it a dealbreaker might be an overreaction. It's a question of whether the discomfort is reasonable and if breaking up is an appropriate response.\n\nIn relationships, certain issues can be dealbreakers if they significantly affect the person's happiness. However, something as non-invasive as a nose ring might not justify ending a two-year relationship. The key is whether the author is being controlling or respecting his partner's autonomy. Since he's making a choice based on his own comfort rather than her well-being, it's more likely he's overstepping. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy is strong. If he can support her through an injury that changes her appearance, why not a choice she makes? It seems like the nose ring is a personal preference that doesn't harm him, whereas an injury is beyond her control. He's prioritizing his comfort over her autonomy here. \n\nIn conclusion, while everyone has the right to set boundaries, making a body modification a dealbreaker that leads to a breakup might be considered controlling and not respecting his partner's autonomy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
