We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving his girlfriend an ultimatum over a nose ring. The author says he's really grossed out by nose rings and made it clear that if she gets one, he can't be in a relationship with her. His girlfriend feels controlled and thinks he's being hypocritical, comparing it to a hypothetical injury scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is being honest about his feelings and his dealbreaker. On the other hand, his girlfriend is asserting her autonomy over her body. The question is whether setting such a condition is controlling or reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for people to have dealbreakers based on personal preferences. However, the line between expressing a preference and being controlling can be blurry. If the author is respecting her autonomy but setting a boundary for himself, that's one thing. But if he's imposing his discomfort on her in a way that's restrictive, that's another.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy is interesting. If he would stay with her through an injury that makes her look different, then why can't he accept a nose ring? The author's response is that the situations feel different to him\u2014supporting her through misfortune is different from a choice she makes for self-expression. That might be a valid distinction, but it could also come off as inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author did mention his discomfort before the ultimatum, and she was planning to get one. They had an argument, and then he gave her an ultimatum. Did he give her a chance to discuss it further, or was it a sudden decision? The way the ultimatum was presented might affect whether it's seen as controlling.\n\nAlso, relationships require compromise. If both partners have to make concessions, but here the author is essentially saying that he can't compromise on this, which is a significant demand. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being compromised.\n\nBut then again, everyone has their boundaries. If the discomfort is genuine and deeply felt, it's not necessarily wrong for the author to set that boundary. However, it's a matter of how it's handled. If the ultimatum is presented without room for discussion, it could be seen as controlling.\n\nIn some cases, people might handle such situations by seeking counseling or finding a middle ground. But sometimes, when a dealbreaker is truly non-negotiable, parting ways is the only option. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the situation is fair or balanced.\n\nConsidering all that, there are arguments both ways. But the key point is whether the author's actions are controlling. By making it a dealbreaker and giving an ultimatum, he's imposing his preference in a way that affects her freedom. This could be seen as controlling, hence the author might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's transparent about his limits from the start, it's his right. The answer hinges on the balance between personal autonomy and relationship boundaries.\n"
