We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about getting a nose ring. The situation is a bit complex because it involves personal discomfort versus bodily autonomy.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're really grossed out by nose rings and find them uncomfortable. They've been in a two-year relationship, and this came up after dinner, leading to an argument. The key point here is that the author told their girlfriend that if she got a nose ring, he would break up. The girlfriend feels this is controlling, which the author acknowledges but stands by their decision.\n\nThe question is whether this is a valid dealbreaker. On one hand, everyone has the right to their own body, and the girlfriend's choice to get a nose ring is her decision. On the other hand, relationships involve compromise. If something genuinely makes one partner uncomfortable to the point of affecting the relationship, it's a valid concern. However, the line between being respectful and being controlling is thin here.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about potential injuries that might make the author uncomfortable is a good point. It highlights the inconsistency: supporting a partner through an injury is expected, but the same isn't being asked for a nose ring. That could make the author seem hypocritical.\n\nBut the author argues that the situations are different. Injuries are involuntary, while a nose ring is a personal choice. However, the core issue is whether the author is overstepping by making it a dealbreaker. While personal discomfort is valid, using it to end a relationship might be seen as extreme unless there's more to it, like deep-seated issues or other unresolved problems.\n\nThe fact that the couple usually gets along well suggests that this is a specific issue rather than a pattern of control. However, making a decision about someone's body based on personal preference can come off as controlling, even if the person doesn't intend it that way. The author's stance is firm, but so is the girlfriend's right to self-expression.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are personal, but they should be discussed early on. Since the author didn't mention this before the relationship progressed, it's possible they didn't consider how important the nose ring is to their partner. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that it's a significant issue for her, and the author's response might not be as respectful of her autonomy as he believes.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using personal discomfort to control their partner's body choice, which can be seen as a breach of trust and respect in the relationship. However, if the discomfort is genuine and it's causing significant distress, it's a mutual issue. But the way it's presented here leans more towards the author overstepping.\n"
