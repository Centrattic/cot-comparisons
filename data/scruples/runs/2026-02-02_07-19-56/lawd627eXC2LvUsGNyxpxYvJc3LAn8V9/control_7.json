We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that the author finds nose rings gross and uncomfortable, and told their girlfriend that if she got one, they'd break up. The girlfriend feels controlled, and the author is questioning if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy. The girlfriend's argument is that she has the right to modify her body as she sees fit. The author's stance is that their discomfort is a dealbreaker, which they're entitled to, but the way they expressed it (an ultimatum) might be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus personal boundaries. The author is trying to set a boundary based on their personal feelings, which is their right. However, making the other person choose between a body modification they want and the relationship could be seen as controlling, especially if the modification isn't harmful. The girlfriend's point about potential injury is a good counter because it's a natural situation where support is expected despite discomfort, highlighting hypocrisy.\n\nBut then, the author isn't forcing her to get the piercing; they're just saying their discomfort is too much for them to handle in a relationship. It's a matter of dealbreakers being personal. However, using a relationship as leverage over personal choices can be seen as controlling. The author acknowledges that the girlfriend should be in charge of her body but then uses that as a reason to end the relationship, which might be contradictory.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author isn't wrong for having their own preferences, but the ultimatum approach might cross into being controlling. The answer might depend on whether the nose ring is a significant enough issue to justify breaking up, considering it's a personal choice. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's about bodily autonomy. So, the author might be in the wrong for making it an ultimatum rather than finding a compromise or accepting the choice even with their discomfort.\n"
