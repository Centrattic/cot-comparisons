We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum is in the wrong. So the situation is that they're in a two-year relationship, live together, and after a dinner conversation, the guy told his girlfriend he'd break up if she got a nose ring. She felt controlled, he felt it was a dealbreaker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy says nose rings gross him out. He respects her autonomy but can't be in a relationship if she gets one. She argues he's being controlling by making a body autonomy issue a dealbreaker. \n\nBody autonomy is a strong point. People have the right to modify their bodies. The guy's discomfort is valid, but using it as a breakup reason seems extreme. He's saying that her personal choice is a dealbreaker. Is that fair? Maybe it depends on whether it's a reasonable request or a controlling move. \n\nHe did acknowledge she should be in charge of her body but still set a breakup condition. That might be contradictory. She challenged him by comparing to a hypothetical injury, which he couldn't answer well. That makes the guy seem hypocritical. If he can support her through an injury, why not a nose ring? His reasoning might not hold up. \n\nOn the other hand, some people have specific turn-offs. But when it's about body autonomy, it's a tough line to draw. The guy could be in the right if this is a genuine dealbreaker for him, but he's putting pressure on her to conform. However, the way he's enforcing it could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe community often frowns on ultimatums that infringe on personal choices unless there's a deeper issue. The key here is if the nose ring is a non-negotiable because of his personal discomfort, which he's honest about. But the argument is about whether it's fair to break up over it. \n\nI think the answer leans toward AITA being on the author's side. He's making a decision based on his personal dislike, which may not be a legitimate reason to end a relationship. The girlfriend's perspective on autonomy is valid, and using a breakup threat over a body adornment might be seen as controlling. So the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
