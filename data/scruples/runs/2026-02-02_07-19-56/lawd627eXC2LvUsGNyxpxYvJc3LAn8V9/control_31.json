We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings and finds them gross. They've been in a two-year relationship with their girlfriend, who wants to get a nose ring. The author told her that if she gets one, he wouldn't want to be in the relationship anymore. The girlfriend feels this is controlling, and the author is conflicted because they agree she should have autonomy over her body but still see it as a dealbreaker.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here is about personal autonomy versus relationship dealbreakers. In relationships, it's common for people to have certain boundaries. If something is a dealbreaker, it's generally okay to express that. However, it's important to consider whether the issue is something that infringes on the other person's rights or autonomy. \n\nThe girlfriend argues that the author is being controlling by making a body modification a dealbreaker. On the other hand, the author is honest about their discomfort. The question is whether making a choice about body modification a dealbreaker is reasonable.\n\nI should also think about the context. The author isn't forcing her to do anything; they're stating their own limits. But they are essentially saying that her choice to modify her body would lead to the end of the relationship. That could be seen as using a relationship ultimatum over a personal choice. However, if this level of discomfort is genuine and a significant issue for the author, it might be justified from their perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison the girlfriend made: what if she was injured and looked different? The author said he would support her then, but the girlfriend points out the inconsistency. The difference here is that an injury isn't a choice, whereas a nose ring is a voluntary modification. The author's response here might highlight a double standard, but the context of choice vs. circumstance is different.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author did express their feelings honestly, which is important. However, the ultimatum might be seen as extreme. The question is whether the author is being reasonable in their stance or if they're overstepping by making it a dealbreaker.\n\nIn many cases, personal grooming and body modifications are seen as individual choices, and unless they cause harm or conflict, they shouldn't affect a relationship. But if one partner has a strong aversion that leads to significant discomfort, it's a valid concern. The issue becomes whether the author is respecting their girlfriend's autonomy while also acknowledging their own feelings.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is being controlling. If the author is allowing their girlfriend to make her own choice but is choosing to end the relationship because of it, they might not be controlling her per se. However, using a relationship as leverage for a body choice could be seen as a form of control. Alternatively, if the author is being transparent about their dealbreaker, it's a matter of compatibility rather than control.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing their genuine feelings and boundaries. They aren't forcing the girlfriend to do anything but are stating that their own comfort level is such that they cannot continue the relationship if she proceeds. It's a tough call, but in terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal values and relationship compatibility. So the answer is B (No).\n"
