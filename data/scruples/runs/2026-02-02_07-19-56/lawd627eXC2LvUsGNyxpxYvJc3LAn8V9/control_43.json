We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that the author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend it's a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup threat if she gets one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've been dating two years and live together. The author feels strongly about nose rings making them uncomfortable and sees it as a dealbreaker. The girlfriend sees it as controlling, emphasizing her autonomy over her body. The author acknowledges her right to her body but still sets a condition that if she gets a nose ring, they can't be in a relationship. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, personal body autonomy is a significant issue. People have the right to modify their bodies as they choose, especially non-harmful choices like a nose ring. If the author is making a decision based on appearance, it could be seen as controlling or prioritizing personal aesthetics over her autonomy. The girlfriend's argument about not breaking up over an injury is a key point here\u2014supporting each other through challenges is a cornerstone of relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their feelings. They didn't force her to remove one if she already had one, but are upfront about their dealbreaker. It's a personal preference, but using it as a dealbreaker might be seen as unfair, especially if it's not health-related or harmful. The author might not be in the wrong if they're transparent, but it's a judgment call. \n\nHowever, the act of making a body modification a dealbreaker could be considered controlling. Relationships require compromise, and this might be an unreasonable demand. The girlfriend's right to her body is a fundamental aspect here. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're imposing their preferences in a way that infringes on her autonomy. \n\nBut maybe the key is whether it's a matter of respect. The author respects her autonomy but still can't handle the discomfort. But if it's a dealbreaker, it's a matter of personal boundaries. However, some might argue that such a preference shouldn't override a partner's autonomy. The answer might hinge on whether controlling behavior is present. Since the author is allowing her to make the choice but ending the relationship, it's a complex situation. \n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have valid points, the act of making a non-harmful body modification a dealbreaker could be seen as prioritizing personal aesthetics over a partner's autonomy, which might be considered controlling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
