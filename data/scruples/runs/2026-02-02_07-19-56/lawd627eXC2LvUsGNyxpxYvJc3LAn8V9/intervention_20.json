We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who gives his girlfriend an ultimatum regarding getting a nose ring. He's really grossed out by nose rings and told her that if she gets one, he might break up with her. They live together and were in a two-year relationship with minimal issues before this argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that nose rings make him uncomfortable and he's honest about it. He even acknowledges that others might not mind them. He tried to communicate his feelings but ultimately set a dealbreaker. The girlfriend's side is that she wants autonomy over her body and feels controlled. She's upset because she sees his ultimatum as controlling, even though he's agreed she should have control over her body.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus personal preferences. The author is trying to express discomfort, which is valid, but setting an ultimatum based on personal discomfort might be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is about bodily autonomy, which is a significant issue. People have the right to modify their bodies as they choose without facing pressure from a partner unless it's a matter of mutual decision-making.\n\nThe author's argument that he's not controlling because he allows her to make the choice is a bit contradictory. By giving her an ultimatum, he's essentially controlling the outcome of the relationship based on her decision. Even if he's truthful about his feelings, the ultimatum itself can be seen as an overreach. The girlfriend's point about potential injury is a valid comparison; she's pointing out hypocrisy in his stance. The author's response that supporting her in the case of injury is different, but it's not the same as a voluntary body modification. However, the comparison highlights that he's using personal discomfort as a basis for a major decision affecting both of them.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are usually about non-negotiable values or behaviors, not personal aesthetics. If someone's appearance choice leads to a breakup, that's a heavy consequence. The author might be justified in his feelings of discomfort, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. It's possible he's not in the wrong if his feelings are genuine and he's communicated them honestly, but the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. Alternatively, he's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy, which is a core aspect of a healthy relationship.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the ultimatum is a reasonable response. Since the issue is about personal preference and not a harmful behavior, the author's demand might be unreasonable. The girlfriend's autonomy is a strong point, and using a breakup as a threat based on her choice to modify her body could be controlling. So the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
