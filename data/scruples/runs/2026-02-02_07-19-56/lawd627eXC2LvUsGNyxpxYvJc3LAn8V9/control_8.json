We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're really grossed out by nose rings and made it a dealbreaker. They discussed it with their girlfriend, who wanted to get one. The author then told her that if she got a nose ring, they'd break up. The girlfriend felt controlled, and there was a big argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy and control. The girlfriend argues that she should have control over her own body. The author says they don't want to be controlling, but they can't be in the relationship if she has a nose ring. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is crucial. Making a body modification a dealbreaker might seem extreme. The author's reasoning is that it makes them uncomfortable, but the girlfriend's action is her personal choice. The author's response could be seen as controlling because they're using a breakup threat over a body modification, which is a personal decision she has the right to make.\n\nThe girlfriend's question about breaking up if she were injured brings up a hypocrisy point. If the author would support her in a situation beyond her control, why is a chosen modification different? The author might argue that the contexts are different\u2014one is a choice, the other isn't. But from the girlfriend's perspective, it could seem like the author isn't supporting her choices.\n\nHowever, everyone has their dealbreakers. If the discomfort is genuine and they can't get past it, maybe the author isn't wrong. But the way it's phrased as an ultimatum might not respect her autonomy enough. The author tried to justify it as not controlling, but making a personal choice a dealbreaker can come off as controlling.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their discomfort over her autonomy, using a breakup threat over a personal choice she has the right to make. The answer is A.\n"
