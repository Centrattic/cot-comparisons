We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. The situation is that the author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend that if she gets one, he might break up. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating two years and live together. The author says nose rings are a dealbreaker, but the girlfriend feels it's about her autonomy. The key points here are personal boundaries, consent, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author argues that he respects her right to her body but can't be in a relationship if she has a nose ring. That seems like a personal preference, but when it comes to a relationship, certain preferences can become dealbreakers. However, the girlfriend might see it as controlling because he's using a breakup threat over a body modification she wants.\n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument about a hypothetical injury is interesting. The author acknowledges that if she were injured, he wouldn't break up, implying that he's willing to support her through that. But the difference here is that the injury is involuntary, while the nose ring is a choice. However, is that a valid distinction? Both scenarios involve discomfort with her appearance, but one is chosen, the other is not. The girlfriend might feel that the author is being inconsistent.\n\nNow, considering autonomy versus partnership. In a relationship, both partners have to make compromises. If one partner's choice in body modification is a dealbreaker for the other, it's a significant issue. But is it the author's right to impose such a condition? Or is it unfair to expect her to forgo her personal expression?\n\nThe author might not be controlling in the traditional sense, like dictating her every choice, but using a breakup as leverage over an aesthetic preference that's a dealbreaker could be seen as controlling. The line between personal boundaries and control can be thin. If the author is unable to accept her for who she is, including her personal choices, then maybe the relationship has deeper issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings. He's not trying to hide his discomfort. But the ultimatum itself could be seen as extreme. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss if there's a middle ground, but if it's truly a dealbreaker, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for having that line.\n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend values her autonomy and the author can't accept that, it might mean they're incompatible. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for stating his dealbreaker, but the way he presented it as an ultimatum might be problematic. However, in the context of a relationship, if something is a dealbreaker, it's the individual's right to set that boundary. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because it depends on how controlling the ultimatum is. But since he's being honest and respecting her autonomy otherwise, maybe it's not wrong. Alternatively, using a breakup threat over a non-harmful choice could be seen as controlling. Hmm. I need to weigh these factors.\n"
