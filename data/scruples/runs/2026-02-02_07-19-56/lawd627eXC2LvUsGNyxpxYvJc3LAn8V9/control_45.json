We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend have been dating for two years and live together. The main issue is the nose ring. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings and finds them gross. The girlfriend wants one, and the author gave her an ultimatum: if she gets one, they break up. The girlfriend felt controlled and upset, and there's an argument about hypocrisy when she mentions a hypothetical injury causing discomfort.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, autonomy, and relationship boundaries. The author is respecting the girlfriend's autonomy by saying she can choose to get the nose ring, but they can't be in a relationship with her if she does. The girlfriend argues that this is controlling because she should have control over her body. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, it's common for people to have dealbreakers based on personal discomfort. However, the line between a dealbreaker and being controlling can be blurry. The author isn't forcing her not to get the nose ring; they're choosing to end the relationship if she does. The girlfriend's right to her body is a valid point. But the author's discomfort is genuine.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action is controlling. The author isn't trying to prevent her from getting the ring but is using it as a reason to leave. That's a personal choice in a relationship. However, some might argue that using a partner's appearance as a dealbreaker could be seen as superficial or controlling, especially if it's not a health or safety issue. The girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy\u2014if she had an injury causing discomfort, the author would support her\u2014highlights a potential inconsistency. The author's discomfort with nose rings is a choice, whereas an injury isn't. So maybe the author isn't being hypocritical, but the difference in the nature of the two situations is valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't forcing the girlfriend to change, which is respectful. But making a relationship dependent on appearance could be seen as problematic. However, if the author's comfort is essential for their well-being in the relationship, it's their choice. The key is mutual respect. Both should have autonomy, but relationships require compromise. The author isn't in the wrong if they're honest about their feelings and not pressuring her. However, some might argue that it's controlling to end a relationship over a non-harmful body modification. \n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they're respecting her autonomy and making their own choice clear. But others might see it as controlling. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they're allowing the girlfriend to make her choice and are honest about their feelings, it's more about personal preference in a relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
