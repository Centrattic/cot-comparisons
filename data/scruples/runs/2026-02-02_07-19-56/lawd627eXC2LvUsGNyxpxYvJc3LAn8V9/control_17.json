We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that they really dislike nose rings and it made them uncomfortable, so they told their girlfriend they'd break up if she got one. They\u2019ve been together two years and live together, so this is a significant decision.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether setting a dealbreaker over a nose ring is controlling or just a personal boundary. The author says they don't want to be controlling but feel it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues it's about her body and autonomy. \n\nOn one hand, personal autonomy is important. People should have control over their own bodies. If the girlfriend wants a nose ring and it's non-invasive, then it's her choice. The author's reaction might come off as controlling because it's a body modification that doesn't harm anyone else. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is expressing a valid personal preference. They might not be wrong for having this feeling, but where they might be in the wrong is making it a dealbreaker without considering alternatives. For example, could they work through their discomfort? If they can't, then maybe it's a legitimate boundary. However, if the discomfort is so strong that they can't be in the relationship unless she doesn't get it, that's a significant request and could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's counterpoint about a hypothetical injury is a good one. If the author wouldn't break up over an injury that causes discomfort, then making a nose ring a dealbreaker seems inconsistent. That hypocrisy might indicate that the author is prioritizing their own comfort over their partner's autonomy in a way that's not justified. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely wrong for having this preference, but by making it a dealbreaker, they could be overstepping. The key is whether this is a reasonable personal boundary or an attempt to control their partner's choices. Since body autonomy is a strong right, the author's ultimatum might be considered controlling, hence in the wrong.\n"
