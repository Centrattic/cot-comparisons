We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the author is grossed out by nose rings and is giving his girlfriend an ultimatum about getting one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating two years and live together, so they're pretty involved. The author says nose rings are a dealbreaker for him. He respects her autonomy but still wants to end the relationship if she gets one. The girlfriend feels controlled and upset, which is a common reaction when someone's personal choice is met with a relationship ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are about body autonomy and relationship expectations. The author acknowledges she should have control over her body but still uses that as a reason to break up. That seems contradictory. Even if something is a dealbreaker, the way it's presented matters. ultimatums can be seen as controlling if they force the other person to choose between their own desires and the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument about hypothetical injuries is a strong point. It challenges the author's consistency in handling discomfort in the relationship. If he wouldn't break up over something beyond her control, why nose rings? That inconsistency might make his stance seem more controlling than genuine.\n\nAlso, in healthy relationships, compromise is essential. If the author can't accept her desire for a nose ring without it affecting the relationship, maybe the issue is about his own discomfort rather than her choice. It's important to differentiate between valid reasons for a dealbreaker and personal preferences that might not be worth losing a partner over.\n\nHowever, the author isn't threatening her directly but presenting his feelings honestly. He's trying to communicate his boundaries. But when it leads to a breakup ultimatum based on personal preference, that could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy. The line between personal boundaries and control can be thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, using an ultimatum over a personal choice that doesn't harm the relationship could be seen as the wrong approach. The girlfriend's right to her body is significant, and making it a dealbreaker might be inconsiderate. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
