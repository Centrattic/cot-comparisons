We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author is uncomfortable with nose rings and told their girlfriend it's a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup threat.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here. The girlfriend wanted a nose ring, and the author felt it was a dealbreaker. They argued, and she felt controlled. The author says they don't want to be controlling but still made it a dealbreaker. The girlfriend's argument was about autonomy over her body versus the author's discomfort. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, people have the right to make choices about their own bodies. On the other, relationships require compromise. But where's the line between healthy compromise and being controlling? The author is making a choice based on personal discomfort, which is their right. However, making it a dealbreaker could be seen as prioritizing their own preferences over the partner's autonomy. \n\nThe girlfriend's point about hypocrisy\u2014if she were injured and looked different, the author wouldn't break up\u2014is interesting. It's a comparison between personal choice (getting a nose ring) and involuntary change (injury). The author might see the difference, but the girlfriend feels the situation is similar in terms of discomfort. \n\nIs the author being controlling? If the author respects their girlfriend's autonomy but still can't accept the nose ring, maybe it's a valid preference. But making it a dealbreaker without negotiation could be seen as ultimatum, which is controlling. The question is whether the author is overstepping by making a personal preference a dealbreaker. \n\nIn relationships, some issues are dealbreakers. If the author finds nose rings so offensive that they can't be in a relationship, it's their choice. But others might argue that this is an unreasonable demand. The key is whether the author is respecting the partner's autonomy. The author acknowledges she should control her body but still refuses to accept it, leading to a breakup. That's a conflict between personal autonomy and personal preferences. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's preference is reasonable. Since nose rings are a form of self-expression, and many people find them acceptable, the author's discomfort might not justify a breakup. However, in relationships, partners do have to make sacrifices. The author might not be wrong in their feelings, but enforcing their preference as a dealbreaker could be seen as controlling. So, maybe the answer is yes, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nThe author says they don't want to be controlling, but their action is a form of control. The girlfriend's right to bodily autonomy is a strong point. Even if the author is uncomfortable, making it a dealbreaker without negotiation could be seen as imposing their will. So, probably the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
