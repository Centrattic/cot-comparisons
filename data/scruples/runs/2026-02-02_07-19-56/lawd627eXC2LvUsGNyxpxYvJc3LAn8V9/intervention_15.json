We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend says he's really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. He told his girlfriend he couldn't be in a relationship with her if she got one. She felt this was controlling, even though he acknowledged she should have autonomy over her body. The girlfriend argues that if she were injured and looked different, he wouldn't break up with her, so why the difference with a nose ring? The boyfriend says it's a dealbreaker for him.\n\nSo, the key points here are autonomy vs. personal boundaries. The girlfriend is asserting her right to modify her body as she sees fit, which is a valid stance. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is setting a boundary based on his comfort level. But when he frames it as a dealbreaker, he's essentially telling her that her choice could end the relationship. That can come off as controlling because it's imposing his preferences as a condition for the relationship's continuation.\n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument about injury is important. It highlights a potential inconsistency: supporting her through unavoidable physical changes but not those she chooses. This could make her feel that his objection is more about aesthetics than genuine support. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but turning it into an ultimatum crosses into controlling behavior by making her choice a dealbreaker.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy unless it directly affects the other person's well-being. Since a nose ring is a personal choice and not a health issue, the boyfriend's ultimatum seems to prioritize his comfort over her autonomy. The girlfriend's reaction about feeling controlled is valid because he's essentially saying her decision could end the relationship, which is a significant power imbalance.\n\nSo, while both sides have valid points, the act of making her choice a dealbreaker is what's problematic here. It's about respecting her autonomy versus enforcing his personal boundaries to the point of controlling the relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
