We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The key points here are about personal boundaries, autonomy, and relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that nose rings gross them out and make them uncomfortable. They love their girlfriend but see it as a dealbreaker. The girlfriend argues that it's controlling because she should have autonomy over her body. The author says they agree with her autonomy but still set a boundary that could lead to a breakup.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, it's common for people to have dealbreakers. However, the line between a personal preference and controlling behavior can be blurry. The author isn't forcing her to remove an existing nose ring but is saying they can't be in a relationship if she chooses to get one. That might be seen as a personal limit rather than control. However, the girlfriend feels controlled, which is a significant emotional response. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that their discomfort is a dealbreaker, but the girlfriend brings up a valid counterpoint about hypothetical injuries. The author acknowledges some hypocrisy here but still stands by their stance. This could indicate a lack of flexibility or empathy, which might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has different boundaries, and relationships require mutual respect. If the author's deep discomfort is genuine, they might not be wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. But pushing someone to change their body for them can be problematic. The fact that they live together and have been in a stable relationship adds weight to the potential impact of this decision.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's demand is reasonable. While they're not forcing her to remove a current piercing, they're preventing her from making a future choice that affects her body. This could be viewed as controlling because it's about her autonomy. However, if it's a non-negotiable for the author's own happiness, some might see it as a legitimate boundary. The answer hinges on whether the dealbreaker is reasonable and communicated constructively. The author might be wrong if they're prioritizing their discomfort over her autonomy without considering alternatives, but not everyone will see it the same way.\n"
