We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend have been dating two years, living together, and generally have low friction. They had a big argument when the author expressed discomfort with nose rings. The author made it clear that if the girlfriend gets a nose ring, they would break up. The girlfriend felt controlled, arguing that she should have autonomy over her body. The author tried to explain it's a dealbreaker due to personal discomfort, not because of any judgment. The girlfriend compared it to supporting her if she were injured, which the author didn't think they would break up over. Now the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. First, relationships often involve compromise. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable or controlling. The author says nose rings gross them out and make them uncomfortable, which is a personal preference. But they're using that as a dealbreaker. The girlfriend feels it's an ultimatum over her body autonomy.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is crucial. If one partner is making a decision about the other's body based on their own discomfort, that can be seen as controlling. The author acknowledges that others might find nose rings nice, but their personal discomfort is leading them to end the relationship. That seems like a conflict between personal preferences and mutual respect.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about being in charge of her body is valid. If the author can't accept that, it might be a dealbreaker, but it's also possible they're not considering the girlfriend's feelings and autonomy enough. The comparison to injury is interesting. The author says they wouldn't break up over an injury, which implies that some things are more important than personal discomfort. But nose rings are a choice, not an accident. So the situations aren't the same. Still, the girlfriend feels the author is being inconsistent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The factors here are autonomy vs. personal preferences. While everyone has their dealbreakers, using a partner's choice to modify their body as a reason to break up might be seen as controlling. The author's stance could be viewed as prioritizing their own comfort over the partner's autonomy. However, some might argue that if it's a genuine dealbreaker and the author has communicated it respectfully, they aren't in the wrong.\n\nBut the key here is that the author didn't discuss this before the girlfriend had plans to get a nose ring. They brought it up suddenly and made an ultimatum. If the author had previously expressed discomfort and the girlfriend decided to go through with it anyway, maybe the author has a case. But since the girlfriend was planning it and the author only raised the issue after it came up, the author might be seen as being controlling and not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy. The fact that the author is in their mid-20s and the relationship is two years suggests that maybe they should have discussed this earlier or found a compromise.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're imposing their personal preference as a dealbreaker without considering the girlfriend's autonomy and the potential imbalance in how they handle different situations (like injury vs. choice). Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
