We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. The author is uncomfortable with nose rings and sees it as a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup. The girlfriend argues that the author is being controlling and that she should have autonomy over her body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of autonomy in relationships. It's generally accepted that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The girlfriend's argument that she should be in charge of her body is valid. However, the author's discomfort is real and personal. But where is the line between personal preferences and controlling behavior?\n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's desire to get a nose ring is to make it a dealbreaker. That's a significant decision, but is it controlling? If the author respects her autonomy, they should accept her decision even if it's something they dislike. However, if the author can't be comfortable in the relationship without that change, then their own boundaries are also important. \n\nThe girlfriend's counterargument about hypothetical injury is a good point. If the author would stay with her if she had an injury that made her look different, why break up over a choice she makes? This highlights potential inconsistency. The author's reaction might be seen as controlling because it's a choice the girlfriend is making, not an involuntary change. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their feelings. They didn't force her to remove a nose ring if she already had one, but they're setting a boundary based on their own comfort. The key issue is whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's autonomy versus imposing their preferences. \n\nIn relationships, certain preferences can become dealbreakers if they significantly affect one's happiness. But when it comes to body autonomy, especially elective choices like piercings, the line is thin. The author's action might be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over the girlfriend's autonomy, which could be viewed as controlling. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision to make the nose ring a dealbreaker might be within their rights if they can't be happy otherwise. However, the way they presented it\u2014insisting she not get it and then breaking up if she does\u2014could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's right to choose her appearance is a strong point. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy, even if they're being honest about their feelings.\n"
