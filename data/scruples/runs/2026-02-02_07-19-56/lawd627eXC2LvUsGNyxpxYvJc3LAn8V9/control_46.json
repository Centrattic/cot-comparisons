We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author says they're really grossed out by nose rings and find them uncomfortable. They told their girlfriend that if she gets a nose ring, they can't be in a relationship. The girlfriend feels this is controlling, and the author is conflicted because they acknowledge it's her body but still don't want her to get it. The key points here are about personal boundaries, autonomy, and whether the author is overstepping.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that the author is being controlling by making a decision about her body. The author counters that they're just expressing discomfort. The question is whether this is an ultimatum, which is a dealbreaker. The author mentions they don't want to be controlling but feel it's a dealbreaker.\n\nNow, in relationships, certain things can be dealbreakers if they conflict with core values or cause significant discomfort. However, the issue here is body autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to modify her body as she sees fit. The author's reaction might be valid in terms of their own feelings, but using it as an ultimatum could be seen as controlling because they're essentially saying her choice affects their willingness to stay in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's point about a hypothetical injury is a good counter. If the author would stay despite an injury that makes them uncomfortable, they might be being inconsistent. The author's discomfort is real, but the ultimatum implies that their comfort takes precedence over her autonomy in this specific case.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, it's possible they're not in the wrong if they genuinely find nose rings a dealbreaker and communicate it upfront. However, using an ultimatum on something that's a personal choice (like a nose ring) might be seen as controlling. The balance between respecting each other's boundaries is key. If the author didn't express this discomfort earlier, it might be more of an issue. But in this case, they mentioned it after the fact, which could be where the problem lies. The girlfriend felt her autonomy was being challenged, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for making a personal choice about her body a dealbreaker without finding a compromise or addressing the issue before it became an ultimatum. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to make sure. Wait, but if it's a genuine dealbreaker, some might say they're not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that the author didn't consider the hypothetical injury scenario and the girlfriend's autonomy more strongly suggests that the author's stance is controlling. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
