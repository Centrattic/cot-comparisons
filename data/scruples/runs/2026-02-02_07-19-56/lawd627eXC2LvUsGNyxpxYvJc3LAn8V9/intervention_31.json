We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy giving his girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. He says nose rings gross him out and that it's a dealbreaker for him. He told her she should get one if she wants, but he'd break up with her if she does.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. \n\nFirst, body autonomy is a big factor here. The girlfriend wants to modify her body, which is her right. The author is using his feelings about her appearance as a reason to break up. That could be seen as controlling. He's prioritizing his own comfort over her autonomy. \n\nOn the flip side, in relationships, people do have dealbreakers. If something is truly a dealbreaker, it's part of their values. But is using appearance as a dealbreaker reasonable? It's subjective. Nose rings are a personal choice, not harmful. If the guy can't get past his discomfort, maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. But does that make him wrong? \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about being hypocritical\u2014if he would stay with her if she was injured, why leave over her choice? That's a good point. The author's reasoning might be inconsistent. \n\nHowever, people have different thresholds for what's dealbreakers. If he's clear and honest, maybe it's not his fault. But making someone choose between their body autonomy and the relationship is a heavy-handed approach. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's using his personal discomfort with a non-harmful body modification as a reason to break up, which can be seen as controlling. The answer is A.\n"
