We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, is really grossed out by nose rings. They live together and have been mostly friction-free until this argument. The girlfriend wanted to get a nose ring, and the author told her that if she did, he might break up with her. She felt controlled and upset, arguing that the author is being hypocritical when he mentions supporting her if she were injured. The author is now asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author says he doesn't judge people with nose rings but finds them uncomfortable. That's important because it's a personal preference. However, making it a dealbreaker could be problematic. The girlfriend's argument is about autonomy over her body, which is a valid point. She's in control of her own body, and the author's reaction might be seen as controlling if he's pressuring her not to get the piercing for his comfort.\n\nThe author's counter-argument is that he's not trying to control her but is honest about his feelings. However, by making it a dealbreaker, he's essentially telling her that her choice could end the relationship. That's a significant ultimatum. The girlfriend's question about breaking up if she were injured is a good point. If the author would support her in that scenario, why not here? It seems like a double standard because the discomfort is similar, but one is a choice and the other is an accident. But the author's response is that the contexts are different, which might be a valid distinction. However, the girlfriend might see it as the author prioritizing his comfort over her autonomy in the nose ring case, but not in the injury case.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author approached the topic directly, which is good, but the way he made it a dealbreaker might be too harsh. Relationships require compromise, and if this is a non-negotiable for the author, it could be a problem. However, if it genuinely causes him significant distress and he's communicating that honestly, it might not be entirely his fault. Yet, the key issue is whether his reaction is reasonable or overstepping.\n\nIn many relationships, personal grooming choices are up to the individual unless they affect the other person's well-being. A nose ring is a personal choice and doesn't directly harm the author. The author's discomfort is his own issue to manage, and using it as a reason to break up might be seen as prioritizing his feelings over her autonomy. The girlfriend's right to make decisions about her body is a strong point here.\n\nAlso, the author's comparison to an injury is a bit tricky. If she were injured, the author's support would be about caring for her despite the change. In this case, the change is elective, so the author's stance could be seen as less about supporting her through hardship and more about imposing his preferences. That might make his position seem less reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's using his personal discomfort as a reason to pressure his girlfriend not to make a choice about her own body, which can be viewed as controlling. While it's okay to express feelings, making it a dealbreaker without compromise could be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend's valid argument about autonomy and the author's potential hypocrisy add weight to the idea that he's in the wrong here.\n"
