We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author says they're grossed out by nose rings and that it's a dealbreaker, leading them to break up if she gets one. The girlfriend argues it's controlling. \n\nFirst, the key points here are autonomy and dealbreakers. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her body, which is a significant point. However, the author believes their comfort is so important that they can't be in a relationship if she gets a nose ring. That's a heavy stance.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are personal, but they should be discussed early. The couple has been together two years and lives together, so maybe this was a late discussion. The author might not have communicated this issue before, which could make it seem controlling. The girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy when comparing to potential injuries is a good point\u2014supporting her through tough times versus changing her appearance for his comfort might be seen as inconsistent.\n\nHowever, personal boundaries are valid. If someone finds something extremely uncomfortable, they might feel justified in their stance. But the line between personal preference and control can be thin. The author's ultimatum could be seen as prioritizing their comfort over her autonomy, which might be problematic.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer probably leans towards the author being in the wrong because forcing a partner to not modify their body for one's comfort might be controlling. However, it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit. But the main issue is whether the author's dealbreaker is reasonable and discussed adequately. Since it's a late decision and affects her autonomy, the answer is likely A (yes, author is wrong).\n"
