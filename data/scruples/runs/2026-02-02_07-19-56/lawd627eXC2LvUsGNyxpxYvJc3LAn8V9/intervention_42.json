We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author gave their girlfriend an ultimatum about getting a nose ring, which they find gross and uncomfortable. They ended up breaking up because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating two years and live together. The girlfriend wants a nose ring, which the author really dislikes. The author's stance is that they can't be in a relationship if she gets one. The girlfriend argues that it's controlling and about autonomy over her body.\n\nThe author claims not to be controlling, but the ultimatum seems like a control issue. Autonomy is a big factor here. People generally have the right to modify their bodies as they choose, especially if it's elective. The author is prioritizing their comfort over her autonomy, which could be seen as one-sided.\n\nThe girlfriend's point about hypothetical scenarios (like an injury) is valid. If the author wouldn't break up over an injury, why a nose ring? That brings up the issue of fairness and consistency. The author is making a choice based on aesthetics, which is subjective, while the girlfriend's argument is about bodily autonomy and mutual respect.\n\nHowever, relationships do involve compromise. The author might feel that this is a dealbreaker, but it's important whether there's been prior discussion. If this was a sudden ultimatum, it might be seen as unfair. Also, the author's reaction to the hypothetical shows a lack of consideration for her perspective.\n\nIn many cases, expecting a partner to change their appearance for your comfort can be seen as controlling. The key is mutual respect. The author's refusal to accept her decision, despite her autonomy, might tip the balance towards them being in the wrong. Unless there's a deeper reason (like cultural or religious reasons), it's about personal preference, which shouldn't override another person's autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're imposing their discomfort on the girlfriend's choice over her body. They should have addressed it earlier or found a compromise instead of an ultimatum.\n"
