We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who gave their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is uncomfortable with nose rings and told his girlfriend it's a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup threat. The girlfriend argues that he's being controlling and hypocritical, especially when he mentions that he wouldn't break up over an injury that affects her appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy. The girlfriend wants to make a personal choice about her body. The guy is saying that if she goes against his wishes, he'll end the relationship. That seems like a form of control because he's imposing his discomfort on her physical autonomy. The key point here is whether his discomfort justifies a breakup. \n\nHypocrisy angle: He says he would support her if she was injured, but in that case, it's not a choice. She's comparing it to a situation where he might have to accept something involuntary. His breaking up over a voluntary choice might be seen as inconsistent. That's a valid argument from her side.\n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are common, but they should be reasonable and not infringe on the other person's autonomy. Wanting a nose ring is a personal choice. If one partner's comfort level requires the other to change their body in a way they don't want to, that's a significant issue. However, the guy is making it clear that he can't be in a relationship if she gets a nose ring. \n\nThe problem is that this ultimatum is putting pressure on her to conform to his preferences, which could be seen as controlling. Healthy relationships require mutual respect. If he can't respect her choice to modify her body, even if it makes him uncomfortable, then maybe the issue is more about his inability to handle differences rather than the nose ring itself.\n\nOn the other hand, he's transparent about his feelings. He didn't hide his discomfort. The question is whether that's enough to justify a breakup. But if he's willing to accept other involuntary changes but not this voluntary one, it does seem hypocritical. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he's prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy and is using a controlling ultimatum. The answer would be A.\n"
