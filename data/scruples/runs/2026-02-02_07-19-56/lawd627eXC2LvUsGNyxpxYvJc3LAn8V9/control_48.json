We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with their girlfriend, and they live together. They don't usually have conflicts, but this nose ring thing is causing a big argument. The author is really grossed out by nose rings and finds them uncomfortable. The girlfriend wants to get one. The author told her that if she gets a nose ring, he might break up because it's a dealbreaker. She felt controlled and brought up a hypothetical about her being injured, which he agreed he wouldn't leave her for. She thinks he's being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is expressing a strong personal discomfort, which is valid. But he's using that as a dealbreaker, which could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's argument is about autonomy over her body. She has the right to modify her body as she sees fit, and the author's ultimatum might be infringing on that. However, relationships do involve compromise. If both parties can't agree on something that affects their comfort, maybe the issue is about whether the author's feelings are reasonable.\n\nBut wait, nose rings are a personal choice. The author is saying he can't be in a relationship if she gets one. That's a big ask. On the other hand, the girlfriend is arguing that her body is hers to decide. The author might not be in the wrong if his feelings are genuine, but he's setting a boundary that's based on a personal preference rather than something harmful. However, using a relationship as a way to control someone's body choices could be problematic. Also, the author acknowledges that it's a dealbreaker, which might make it his own issue rather than hers. \n\nThe girlfriend's hypothetical about injury is a good point. If she were injured in a way that made him uncomfortable, he wouldn't leave, which suggests that his reaction isn't about supporting her through challenges but about a personal aesthetic preference. That does seem hypocritical. \n\nSo the key points are autonomy vs. personal discomfort. The author's ultimatum could be seen as controlling, especially if it's not a matter of health or safety. The girlfriend's right to her body is important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's using a personal preference as a dealbreaker without considering that it's her choice. But maybe there's a middle ground where they can find a solution, like the author working on his discomfort or the girlfriend reconsidering. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's imposing his preferences on her body, which is a fundamental right, he might be in the wrong. So answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
