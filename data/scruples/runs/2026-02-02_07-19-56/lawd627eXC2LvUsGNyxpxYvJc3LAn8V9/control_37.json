We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the guy is really uncomfortable with nose rings and told his girlfriend he would break up if she got one. She felt it was controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy, especially regarding personal choices like body modification. The author is asserting that a nose ring is a dealbreaker, which might be a personal preference, but is it reasonable?\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about autonomy is valid. She chose to get a nose ring to express herself, and the author is imposing his discomfort as a condition for the relationship continuing. That could be seen as controlling because he's making her choice between her own desires and the relationship. But the author says he's not trying to control, just expressing his feelings. However, making it a dealbreaker might cross a line.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different dealbreakers. If someone is uncomfortable with something that's important to their partner, it's a legitimate reason to reconsider the relationship. However, the line between personal preference and control is thin. The author's reasoning is that it's a dealbreaker, but the girlfriend feels it's her body and her choice. The comparison she makes to supporting her if she were injured is a good point. If he can support her in that case, why not in this? It might be inconsistent.\n\nBut the difference is that an injury is unavoidable, while a nose ring is a choice. The author might feel that his discomfort is significant enough to affect the relationship. Still, pressuring someone to change their appearance for you could be seen as disrespectful. The key is whether the author is respecting her autonomy. By making it a dealbreaker, he is effectively telling her to choose between her body and the relationship, which can be controlling. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy. However, some might argue that personal dealbreakers are valid. But the act of ultimatums in such matters can be controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is a red flag, and the author's stance could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
