We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together two years and lives together. The guy is really grossed out by nose rings and told his girlfriend that if she gets one, he'd break up. She felt controlled because she wants autonomy over her body. He argues that he's not judging others but just being honest about his discomfort. She countered with the hypothetical about her being injured, making him rethink.\n\nSo, the key points here are autonomy vs. personal preferences. The guy is clear that it's a dealbreaker, but is that reasonable? On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important in relationships. On the other, he's asking her to change something about herself to accommodate his comfort, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about body autonomy is strong. People should have the right to modify their bodies as they choose. By making her choose between getting a nose ring and the relationship, he's imposing a personal preference as a dealbreaker. That might not be fair unless there's a deeper issue.\n\nBut the user also mentioned that he's not trying to be controlling; he just finds it gross. It's a bit of a gray area. In relationships, partners often have to make compromises. However, expecting someone to forgo a body modification that's important to them could be seen as the wrong approach. The hypothetical about injury is a good counter because you wouldn't break up over that, so why a choice she makes?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether personal preferences can be dealbreakers regardless of their impact on the other person. Since the nose ring is a personal choice and not harmful, using it as a reason to break up might make him the asshole. So, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy without a valid reason beyond personal dislike.\n"
