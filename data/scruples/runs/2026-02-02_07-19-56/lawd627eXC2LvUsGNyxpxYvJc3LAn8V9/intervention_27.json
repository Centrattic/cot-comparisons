We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the guy is really grossed out by nose rings and told his girlfriend it's a dealbreaker. She wanted to get one, and he said if she does, they'd break up. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy says he's not judging others, just that nose rings make him uncomfortable. He loves his girlfriend but feels this is a dealbreaker. She's upset because she feels he's being controlling. The key issue here is whether his stance is reasonable or if it's overstepping.\n\nIn relationships, personal choices like body modifications can be a point of contention. The girlfriend's right to autonomy over her body is a valid point. If she wants to get a nose ring, it's her body, so the guy's opposition might be seen as controlling. However, he's also expressing his feelings honestly. The problem is whether his reaction is excessive. \n\nThe concept of a dealbreaker is subjective. If something is a dealbreaker for someone, it's their personal choice. But in this case, the nose ring isn't causing physical harm; it's a cosmetic choice. The girlfriend might see this as him trying to control her appearance, which can be a big issue in relationships. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about being in a relationship despite an injury is a good parallel. If the guy would stay with her through an injury that affects her appearance, then his stance on the nose ring might seem inconsistent. It's about whether his discomfort is valid enough to justify ending the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy is genuinely uncomfortable and it affects their relationship dynamics, maybe it's reasonable for him to set that boundary. But the line between honest communication and being controlling is thin here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if his reaction is based on personal dislike rather than a mutual discussion and compromise. Body autonomy is important, and if he can't accept that, maybe the real issue is his inability to accept his partner's choices. But if he's being honest about his feelings and she's also being honest about her desires, both have valid points. However, the fact that he's using a breakup as a threat over a non-harmful choice might lean towards him being the asshole. The girlfriend's right to autonomy is a strong point here.\n"
