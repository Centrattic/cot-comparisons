We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. They mentioned being really grossed out by nose rings and that it's a dealbreaker, even though they love their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that personal preferences can affect a relationship, and if something is a dealbreaker, they have the right to set that boundary. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels controlled, as body autonomy is a significant issue. The author argues they don't want to be controlling but also feel their comfort is important.\n\nThe key points here are dealbreakers vs. controlling behavior. In relationships, it's common for people to have non-negotiables. If the author clearly communicated this before the relationship became serious, maybe it's their right. However, if this is a sudden ultimatum, it might seem controlling. The girlfriend's argument about hypotheticals\u2014like her being injured\u2014highlights inconsistency. The author's comfort vs. supporting their partner through challenges is a valid concern. \n\nBut the difference is that a nose ring is a choice, while an injury isn't. The author's stance might be reasonable if it's a genuine dealbreaker, but the way it's presented could be seen as controlling. The argument about hypocrisy might not fully apply because the contexts are different. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't necessarily wrong if they're honest about their dealbreaker. However, it's important to consider if the girlfriend's autonomy is being respected. If the author is willing to accept other limitations but not this one, maybe it's a personal preference. But if the ultimatum is causing significant distress without a clear justification, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong. Because they're imposing a personal preference as a dealbreaker without considering the girlfriend's autonomy, which can be seen as controlling. Relationships should allow both partners to make choices about their bodies, even if it causes discomfort. Unless it's a mutual agreement on such matters, using it as a dealbreaker is problematic.\n"
