We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the guy gives his girlfriend an ultimatum about getting a nose ring. He's really grossed out by them, and he says it's a dealbreaker for him. She argues that he's being controlling by not allowing her to modify her body as she wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy's stance is that nose rings make him uncomfortable, and he can't be in a relationship if she gets one. He acknowledges that she should have control over her body but still makes it a dealbreaker. The girlfriend feels that his reaction is controlling and not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, dealbreakers are personal, but the line between personal preferences and controlling behavior can be blurry. The key here is whether his reaction is reasonable. Nose rings are a form of self-expression, and while he's not judging others, his personal discomfort is leading him to impose a condition on his partner. That could be seen as controlling because he's asking her to change her appearance to accommodate his feelings, which might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's point about hypothetical situations where he'd support her despite her looking different (like an injury) is a good counterargument. If he wouldn't break up over an injury, why a choice like a nose ring? That suggests inconsistency. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if it's a genuine dealbreaker for him, he's not in the wrong for being honest about his feelings. But the issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy. Making her choose between her self-expression and the relationship could be seen as the wrong approach. Instead of an ultimatum, maybe he should work on managing his discomfort or discuss the issue more collaboratively. \n\nGiven that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
