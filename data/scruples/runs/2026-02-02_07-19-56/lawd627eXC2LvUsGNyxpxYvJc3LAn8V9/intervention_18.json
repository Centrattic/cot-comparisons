We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The author mentions that nose rings make them really uncomfortable and that they told their girlfriend it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend felt it was controlling, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid reason for their discomfort\u2014they\u2019re honest about how it affects them and love their girlfriend but see it as a dealbreaker. On the other hand, the girlfriend argues about autonomy over her body, which is a significant point. People should have the right to modify their bodies as they choose, and the author's stance might be seen as imposing his preferences.\n\nHowever, in relationships, both partners have to make compromises. If the author finds nose rings a dealbreaker, maybe they should have discussed this earlier. The fact that the conflict arose after two years might indicate that the author didn't address it sooner, which could contribute to the problem. The girlfriend's point about potential injury is also a good counter\u2014it highlights the difference between personal choice and circumstances beyond control.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being controlling or if it's a genuine dealbreaker. If it's a dealbreaker, then it's not necessarily wrong to express that. But if it's more about personal preference without a strong justification, it might be seen as controlling. The author does agree that the girlfriend should be in charge of her body but still sets a condition. That contradiction could make the situation look like the author is being controlling, even if their intention is to express a dealbreaker.\n\nAlso, considering societal norms, body modifications are a personal choice, and expecting a partner to forgo that could be seen as infringing on their autonomy. The author's discomfort is real, but the decision to break up over it might be extreme. The girlfriend's argument that the author would support her if she had an injury (which isn't her choice) versus choosing a nose ring (her choice) is a valid distinction. The author's response to her hypothetical scenario shows they understand the difference but still set a condition, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the ultimatum might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's not a matter of health or safety. The girlfriend's right to autonomy is a strong point, and the author's decision to make it a dealbreaker could be viewed as controlling. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
