We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for two years, and they live together. He's really uncomfortable with nose rings and even grossed out by them. When the topic came up, he told her he didn't want her to get one, which led to an argument. She felt he was being controlling, and he countered that he respects her right to her body but can't be in a relationship if she has a nose ring. She compared it to a hypothetical injury scenario, which made him think. Now he's wondering if he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are about personal autonomy versus personal boundaries. The girl wants to get a nose ring, which is her choice, but the guy finds it so uncomfortable that he's considering breaking up. The question is whether he's overstepping by making it a dealbreaker.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries in a relationship. If something makes you uncomfortable and it's a dealbreaker, it's not necessarily wrong to communicate that. However, it's important to consider if the issue is something that's within the other person's control and whether it's a reasonable expectation. \n\nIn this case, a nose ring is a personal choice and part of self-expression. The guy is asking her to forgo a personal decision because of his discomfort, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. The girlfriend's point about hypothetical injuries is interesting because it's a situation she can't control. The user acknowledges that he wouldn't break up over an injury, so it might highlight inconsistency in his reasoning.\n\nHowever, the user does mention that he agrees she should be in charge of her body but still sees it as a dealbreaker. This contradiction is a problem. If he's okay with her making choices about her body in other cases but not this one, it could be seen as controlling. The fact that he's made an ultimatum might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nBut at the same time, if it's a genuine dealbreaker for him, he's not wrong to express that. However, the way he's framed it as a non-negotiable might be the issue. Relationships require compromise, and if one person's comfort level is so low that it affects the relationship, it's a problem. The key is whether the issue is a reasonable one. Since nose rings are a common form of body modification and not harmful, his discomfort might be more about personal preference than a valid reason to break up.\n\nAlso, the comparison to an injury is a good point. If he can't support her through an injury but can't handle a nose ring, that inconsistency shows he's prioritizing his own comfort over hers in a situation he controls. That seems unfair.\n\nSo weighing all this, I think the author is in the wrong because he's making a personal preference a dealbreaker without considering the impact on his partner's autonomy and the potential inconsistency in his reasoning.\n"
