We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. So, the situation is that the girlfriend wants a nose ring, but the author is really grossed out by them and said it's a dealbreaker. They ended up arguing, and the girlfriend feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's right here. The author says they don't want her to get a nose ring and would break up if she does. The girlfriend argues that it's her body and that the author is being controlling. But the author claims they agree she's in charge of her body but can't handle the discomfort. \n\nThe girlfriend's point about a hypothetical injury is interesting. If the author wouldn't break up over that, why a nose ring? The author says they're different because one is a choice and the other isn't. But maybe the girlfriend is pointing out inconsistency. \n\nI think the key here is whether it's reasonable to break up over a body modification that's not harmful. The author's discomfort is personal, but can they impose that on their partner? Relationships require compromise, but there are dealbreakers. However, body autonomy is important too. If the author truly can't be in a relationship with her if she gets it, that's a personal boundary. But is that a valid dealbreaker? Some might say it's controlling to expect your partner to change their appearance for you. Others might say it's valid if it's causing significant discomfort. \n\nThe girlfriend feeling controlled is a red flag. The author's stance could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. Even if they agree she should have control, setting an ultimatum based on personal dislike might not be fair. The author should consider if there's a middle ground or if their feelings are too strong. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is wrong) because they're making a demand about their partner's body based on personal dislike without considering her autonomy. But if the author's comfort is a dealbreaker, maybe it's not wrong. But usually, in relationships, you can't expect your partner to alter their appearance unless it's harmful. So leaning towards A.\n"
