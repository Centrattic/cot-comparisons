We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's really grossed out by nose rings and told his girlfriend that if she gets one, he'll break up with her. They've been dating for two years and live together. \n\nFirst, the user is asking if the guy is in the wrong by giving her an ultimatum. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the guy is honest about his feelings and says it's a dealbreaker. He's not trying to control her, but he's also setting boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend argues that he's being controlling by making a decision about her body.\n\nThe guy mentions that he respects her autonomy but can't handle the discomfort. That seems like a valid feeling, but maybe there's a way to work through it without breaking up. However, if it's a dealbreaker for him, he's not wrong in setting that boundary. The girlfriend's point about a hypothetical injury is a good one\u2014suggesting that supporting her in that scenario is important, but maybe that's a different context. Injuries aren't choices, whereas getting a nose ring is. \n\nBut wait, does that make his stance fair? He's choosing to end the relationship based on a choice she makes about her body. That could be seen as controlling because he's making her decision about her body affect their relationship. However, if it's truly a dealbreaker for him, he's not being inconsiderate, just honest about his limits. \n\nI think the key here is whether it's reasonable for him to have such a strong reaction. Nose rings are a common form of self-expression, and while his feelings are valid, they shouldn't override her autonomy. However, in relationships, people do have dealbreakers. If getting a nose ring is important to her and he can't accept that, maybe the problem is that their values are incompatible in this area. \n\nBut is it wrong of him to hold that line? If he's not pressuring her before she even gets it, but then reacts this way after she expresses a desire for it, maybe he's being a bit late in bringing it up. They live together, so they spend a lot of time together. His discomfort is significant, but so is her right to modify her body. \n\nSo, is he controlling? If he's saying he'll end the relationship over it, that's a big consequence. But it's his choice to make. However, the fact that he's making her decision about her body affect the continuation of the relationship could be seen as controlling. The girl's argument about hypocrisy is a good point\u2014supporting her in a situation where she can't control her appearance (injury) but not supporting her in a choice she makes (nose ring) seems contradictory. \n\nBut maybe the difference is that the injury is involuntary, while the nose ring is a choice. Still, his reaction to both might be similar (discomfort), but in the case of an injury, he's supposed to support her. So, if he's not willing to do the same in a voluntary choice, that could indicate a problem. \n\nIn conclusion, while his feelings are real, setting an ultimatum based on a choice about her body could be seen as controlling. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's making her decision about her own body a dealbreaker for the relationship. However, if it's a genuine dealbreaker for him, he's also being honest about his limits. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards yes, he's in the wrong because he's not allowing her autonomy without consequence.\n"
