We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. They mentioned they're really grossed out by nose rings and made it a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup if the girlfriend gets one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect and autonomy in relationships. The girlfriend argues that the author is being controlling by not allowing her to make a personal choice about her body. On the other hand, the author is expressing a genuine discomfort that affects their relationship.\n\nDealbreakers are a common part of relationships. If something is a dealbreaker for one person, it's their right to communicate that. However, the line between a dealbreaker and being controlling can be thin. The key here is whether the author is respecting their girlfriend's autonomy. The author says they agree she should be in charge of her body but still make it a dealbreaker. That seems contradictory because if they truly respect her autonomy, they might need to accept her choice even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nThe girlfriend's point about being hypocritical\u2014if she were injured and looked different, the author wouldn't break up\u2014highlights inconsistency. The author's discomfort with a nose ring is a choice she makes, whereas an injury isn't. This difference might be valid, but the girlfriend feels the author isn't being consistent in their support.\n\nHowever, personal preferences and dealbreakers are subjective. The author has every right to their feelings, but making a choice about their partner's body based on those feelings can be seen as controlling. The fact that they're in a stable, two-year relationship with little friction suggests that this ultimatum is a significant overreaction unless there's a deeper issue.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The author expressed their feelings, but the girlfriend felt it was controlling. The author needs to balance their comfort with their partner's autonomy. Since the girlfriend is making an active choice, the author's refusal to accept it might be crossing a line into controlling behavior, even if their discomfort is genuine.\n\nIn conclusion, while everyone has dealbreakers, the author's insistence on this matter, despite acknowledging the girlfriend's autonomy, seems to infringe on her right to make choices about her body. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
