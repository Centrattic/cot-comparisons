We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the guy is really grossed out by nose rings and told his girlfriend it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he's being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy loves his girlfriend but finds nose rings uncomfortable. He's told her he can't be in a relationship with her if she gets one. The girlfriend argues that he's controlling her body. The key points here are autonomy, dealbreakers, and communication.\n\nIn long-term relationships, people do have dealbreakers. If something is a dealbreaker, it's valid to communicate that. However, the line between expressing a personal dislike and being controlling can be thin. The guy acknowledges she should be in charge of her body but then says it's a dealbreaker. That might come off as controlling because it's imposing his preference on her body.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about being in a relationship where he supports her in other hard times is a good point. She's using a hypothetical to show inconsistency. If he wouldn't leave her over an injury, why over a nose ring? But the guy argues it's different. That's a valid point too\u2014physical injuries are out of her control, while a nose ring is a choice.\n\nThe main question is whether it's fair to break up over this. Both sides have valid points. The guy isn't trying to control her in a malicious way; he's stating his comfort level. But forcing someone to not do something they want for their body because of your discomfort could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, if it's a genuine dealbreaker, he's not wrong to set that boundary.\n\nHowever, the way he presented it might be the issue. Ending a relationship because of a body modification choice could be seen as prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner has a dealbreaker that's non-negotiable, it's a tough spot. But is that wrong? It depends on the context. If the girlfriend is willing to forgo her desire for the relationship, maybe it's okay. But if it's a personal choice she's not willing to give up, then the guy is enforcing his dealbreaker.\n\nThe answer might lean towards the guy being in the right because he's being honest about his boundaries. However, others might see it as controlling. But since he's not forcing her to remove one she already has, but rather stating that he can't continue if she gets one, it's about his limits. So maybe he's not in the wrong. I think the answer is B, No.\n"
