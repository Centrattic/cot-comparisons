We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. The author says they're really grossed out by nose rings and that it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend felt controlled, and the author ended up breaking up if she got one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's discomfort is real, and they love their girlfriend. But the girlfriend has autonomy over her body. The author's reaction seems to be about their own comfort rather than the girlfriend's well-being. However, in relationships, it's common for people to have certain boundaries. The key issue here is whether the author is being controlling or respecting their partner's autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend argued that the author was being hypocritical by comparing it to an injury. If the author supported her through an injury, then why not a nose ring, which she chooses for herself? The author's stance might come off as controlling because they're using their discomfort as a reason to impose a condition on her body. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries, but one person's preferences shouldn't override the other's bodily autonomy unless it's a safety or health issue. The author is prioritizing their own discomfort over the girlfriend's choice, which could be seen as selfish. However, if the author is honest and both parties are okay with the dealbreaker, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But in this case, the girlfriend was upset, suggesting that the author crossed a line. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
