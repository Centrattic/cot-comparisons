We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the guy is upset because his girlfriend wants a nose ring, and he finds them gross. They've been together two years, live together, and usually get along. The argument happened after dinner when the topic came up.\n\nHe says nose rings make him uncomfortable, and he told her if she gets one, they might break up. She's upset because she thinks he's controlling and not respecting her body. He agrees she should control her body but still says it's a dealbreaker. She argues about being hypocritical if she had a different situation, like an injury. He says supporting her would be right, but this feels different.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about relationship boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy. He's saying he can't be in the relationship if she has a nose ring. That seems like a big deal. But he's also honest about his feelings. However, using something like a nose ring as a dealbreaker might be controlling, especially if it's not a health or safety issue. She has the right to make choices about her body. His response of breaking up over it could be seen as prioritizing his discomfort over her autonomy. But he's also being honest about his feelings. The key is whether it's fair to use that as a dealbreaker. Maybe he's not wrong to express his feelings, but setting that ultimatum is problematic. The answer might lean towards A because he's using a personal preference as a dealbreaker, which can be controlling.\n"
