We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about getting a nose ring. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author says nose rings gross them out and made them uncomfortable, to the point of being a dealbreaker. The girlfriend felt controlled and argued that the author should support her choice. The author acknowledges she should be in charge of her body but still sets a condition that might end the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy and relationship expectations. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. However, one person's preference shouldn't override the other's autonomy unless it's a mutual agreement. The author is clearly stating a boundary, but is it reasonable?\n\nDealing with dealbreakers can be tricky. If something is a non-negotiable for one person, it's their right to communicate that. However, the method of communication matters. The author didn't force the girlfriend to remove an existing ring but was giving an ultimatum on a future action. The girlfriend's argument about potential injury is a valid point\u2014why is a choice different from a medical issue? The author's response might indicate inconsistency, but maybe the context is different. A choice to get a piercing is voluntary, whereas an injury is involuntary. That distinction might matter, but it's a thin line.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being controlling. The girlfriend feels controlled, which is a red flag. However, the author isn't preventing her from doing something she's already done; they're expressing discomfort and setting a boundary. If the girlfriend is willing to accept this boundary, maybe it's okay. But if the author breaks up solely for a preference, that might be seen as unreasonable. \n\nIt's also important to consider if the author's reaction is within their rights. Everyone has the right to be in a relationship where they feel comfortable. However, the reaction might be extreme if the nose ring isn't harmful. The girlfriend's right to her body is a strong point. The author's discomfort is their feeling, but it shouldn't dictate another person's choices unless both agreed on such terms beforehand.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're making a choice about their partner's body based on their discomfort, which could be seen as controlling. However, if they've communicated this before and the girlfriend continued with the decision despite knowing, it's a different scenario. From the given info, the ultimatum seems to come up suddenly, which might not respect the girlfriend's autonomy. The author's stance could be a dealbreaker for them, but enforcing it in this context might be overstepping.\n"
