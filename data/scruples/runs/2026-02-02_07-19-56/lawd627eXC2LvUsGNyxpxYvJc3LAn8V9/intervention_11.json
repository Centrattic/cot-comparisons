We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author gave their girlfriend an ultimatum about getting a nose ring. The main issue is about whether that ultimatum crossed the line into being controlling or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is really uncomfortable with nose rings and finds them gross. They mentioned it's a dealbreaker. The girlfriend wants it, which is her personal choice. The author's stance is that while they agree she should have autonomy over her body, they can't be in a relationship if she gets one. That does sound like a dealbreaker, but is it controlling?\n\nThe girlfriend feels controlled because the author is pressuring her to not get something that's her body. But the author is clear that their discomfort is the reason. The girlfriend's counterargument about a hypothetical injury is interesting. The author acknowledges that they wouldn't break up over an injury, which shows they support her in that case. The girlfriend sees hypocrisy because in both scenarios, the author is uncomfortable, but the author sees the difference between a choice and an injury.\n\nSo, the key here is whether setting a dealbreaker over a body modification is controlling. If both partners had discussed their boundaries earlier, maybe they could have adjusted expectations. But since they live together and have been dating two years, maybe this is a new issue. The author is being honest about their feelings and setting a boundary. However, if the girlfriend feels that the author is imposing their preferences on her body, that's a valid concern.\n\nIn relationships, both partners have to make compromises. The author is asking the girlfriend to compromise on something she wants, and she's not willing. The author's stance is that they can't compromise on this, leading to the ultimatum. While it's their right to have such a dealbreaker, it's important to consider if it's fair or if it's an unreasonable expectation. Since the author isn't forcing her to get the nose ring but is saying they can't be in the relationship if she does, it's a matter of whether the author's boundary is reasonable. However, if the author didn't discuss this earlier, it might come off as a sudden ultimatum. But given that the author explained their feelings and the girlfriend still wants it, the author is being honest about their limits. So maybe they are not in the wrong, but it's a tough call.\n"
