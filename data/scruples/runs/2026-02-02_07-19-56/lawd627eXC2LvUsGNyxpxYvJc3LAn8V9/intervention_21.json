We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup ultimatum over a nose ring. The author says they're really grossed out by nose rings and made it a dealbreaker, leading to a break-up. The girlfriend felt controlled and hypocritical when he wouldn't support her in this choice, even though he said he supports her body autonomy.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is asserting their personal dislike, which is valid, but turning it into a dealbreaker might be where it gets complicated. The girlfriend's argument is about autonomy and the hypocrisy of not supporting her choice while expecting support in other situations.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's choices unless they're fundamentally incompatible. If nose rings are a dealbreaker, maybe they weren't compatible in the first place. The author is prioritizing his personal comfort over her autonomy, which could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's point about hypothetical injuries highlights the inconsistency in his stance\u2014supporting her in difficult times but not in a personal choice.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing her to remove an existing nose ring but is opposing a future choice. That might be different. But when he says he can't be in a relationship if she gets one, it does set a boundary that she disagrees with. The question is whether that's controlling. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because while personal preferences are valid, making someone change their appearance as a condition for staying in a relationship crosses into controlling behavior. The girlfriend's autonomy is a significant factor here, and the author's refusal to accept it despite her right to choose her body might be the controlling aspect. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
