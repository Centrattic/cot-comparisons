We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a guy who's really grossed out by nose rings and gave his girlfriend an ultimatum: if she gets one, they break up. They've been dating two years, live together, and this caused a big argument.\n\nFirst, I should consider the guy's perspective. He says he's not judging others but nose rings make him uncomfortable. He loves her but sees it as a dealbreaker. He told her he agrees she can control her body but that he can't be in a relationship with her if she does. That's a tough stance. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels controlled. She argues that he's telling her what to do with her body, which is a valid point. She also brings up a hypothetical about breaking up if she were injured, which the guy says he wouldn't. He sees a difference between her choice and an injury, but she feels it's hypocritical. That's a good point\u2014why is one a dealbreaker but the other isn't? Maybe because the nose ring is a choice she's making, whereas an injury isn't. But does that make the ultimatum okay?\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. When someone's comfort in the relationship hinges on a partner changing their appearance, that can be seen as controlling. The guy is prioritizing his own discomfort over supporting her autonomy. Even if he's not forcing her physically, the ultimatum is a form of pressure. Relationships often require compromise, but this seems like he's not willing to find a middle ground. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't mention this earlier until after dinner when they were talking suggests maybe it's a new issue that came up after two years. If it's a dealbreaker, maybe it should have been discussed sooner. But that's not clear here. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about supporting her in other situations versus in this case is important. The guy's reasoning might not hold up when compared to other hypotheticals. If he's willing to support her through an injury but not a choice she makes, there's inconsistency. That could mean he's being controlling or not considering her autonomy fully.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the guy's discomfort is real, but using it to demand she conform or face a breakup is a significant control tactic. The girlfriend's autonomy might be the more important factor here. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's imposing his preferences on her body and using it as a dealbreaker without considering the broader implications on their relationship and her rights to her own body.\n"
