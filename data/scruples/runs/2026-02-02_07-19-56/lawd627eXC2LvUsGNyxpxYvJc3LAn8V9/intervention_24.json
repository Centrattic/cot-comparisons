We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that the author is really grossed out by nose rings and told their girlfriend that if she gets one, he can't be in a relationship with her. The girlfriend feels controlled and upset, arguing that he's being hypocritical when considering supporting her if she were injured. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics of the relationship. They live together and have been dating two years with little friction. The issue here is a matter of personal preference versus bodily autonomy. The author's discomfort is real, but the girlfriend's autonomy is also a significant factor.\n\nThe author acknowledges that others might like nose rings and doesn't judge them, but for himself, it's a dealbreaker. That's where the conflict arises. The key point is whether imposing a personal preference as a dealbreaker is reasonable. If it's something that can't be overcome, maybe it's a valid decision for the author. However, is it controlling? The girlfriend feels controlled because the author is making a choice about her body, even though he says she can choose to get it and he'll leave.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypothetical injury is interesting. She's pointing out that supporting her in that case would be the right thing, implying that the author's stance on the nose ring is inconsistent. The author's response is that it's different, but the comparison might highlight a lack of support in non-critical situations. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the author can't accept this aspect of his girlfriend's identity, maybe it's a dealbreaker, but he needs to consider whether his reaction is about genuine discomfort or a deeper issue. However, the girlfriend's right to her body is a strong point. The author's ultimatum might be seen as controlling because he's deciding what she can and cannot do with her body, even if he acknowledges her autonomy in words. The ultimatum itself is the controlling act, regardless of his reasoning.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's using his personal discomfort to dictate his girlfriend's bodily choices, which is a form of control. The girlfriend's right to her body is a fundamental aspect of personal autonomy in a relationship. Even if it's a dealbreaker for him, the way he's approaching it\u2014giving an ultimatum\u2014could be seen as not respecting her autonomy enough. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
