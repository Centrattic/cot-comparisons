We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum. The situation is that the author is really uncomfortable with nose rings and told the girlfriend that having one would be a dealbreaker, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels strongly that nose rings make them uncomfortable and that it's a dealbreaker. They tried to explain their feelings but set a clear ultimatum. The girlfriend, on the other hand, felt that this was controlling, as she should have autonomy over her body. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus personal comfort. The author's stance is that they shouldn't have to be in a relationship where they're uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's right to modify her body is a significant factor. In healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to express themselves, unless the issue is something that genuinely affects the relationship beyond just appearance. \n\nThe author argues that it's a dealbreaker, but is a personal aesthetic preference enough to justify ending a relationship? It depends on how essential that aspect is to the individual. However, using it as an ultimatum without considering the other person's autonomy might be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's question about hypothetical injuries adds another layer. The author's response there might indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings, as supporting her through hardship is expected, unlike a choice she makes for self-expression. \n\nBut then, the line between personal preferences and controlling behavior can be thin. If the author is okay with accepting other differences and supports her in other areas, a nose ring might not be a valid dealbreaker. However, if this is a genuine, deep-seated discomfort that affects their relationship negatively, the author might not be wrong in setting that boundary. \n\nHowever, the way the author presented it as an ultimatum could be problematic. In relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The girlfriend's right to her body is fundamental, so the author's insistence here could overstep. It's possible the author isn't being controlling but is instead prioritizing their own comfort, which isn't necessarily wrong, but it's a tough call. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't malicious, using personal aesthetics as a dealbreaker might be seen as inconsiderate towards the partner's autonomy. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
