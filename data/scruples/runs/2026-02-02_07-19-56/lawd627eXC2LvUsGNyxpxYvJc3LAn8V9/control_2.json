We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about the nose ring ultimatum is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his girlfriend he would break up with her if she got a nose ring because it grosses him out. She got upset, saying he was controlling, and he tried to explain that he's not controlling, just honest. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together two years, live together, and usually don't have friction. The issue here is about body autonomy versus personal boundaries. He's saying that nose rings are a dealbreaker for him, even though he doesn't judge others. She feels he's being controlling by trying to influence her decision.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for people to have dealbreakers, but the key is whether those dealbreakers are communicated respectfully. He did communicate his feelings directly, which is important. However, making a breakup conditional on her body modification might be seen as controlling because it's about her autonomy. She has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if it's something that upsets her partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about hypocrisy\u2014like if she were injured and looked different\u2014does make the author consider his stance. But there's a difference between supporting someone through an injury (which is involuntary) versus choosing to modify one's body for aesthetic reasons. However, the author's discomfort is real, and he's honest about it.\n\nOn one hand, being upfront about dealbreakers is part of a healthy relationship. On the other hand, pressuring a partner to change their appearance can be problematic. The line between a valid concern and control can be thin. Since the author is allowing her to make the choice but stating that he can't be in the relationship if she does it, it's a matter of whether the choice is hers to make regardless of his feelings.\n\nIn some relationships, such a dealbreaker might be acceptable if both parties are honest. But others might see it as controlling because it's about her body. The fact that the argument arose shows that this is a sensitive issue. The author is not forcing her to comply but is setting a boundary. However, the fact that it's a breakup ultimatum based on her aesthetic choice could be seen as inconsiderate, even if communicated honestly.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's prioritizing his discomfort over his partner's autonomy. However, others might argue that personal boundaries are valid. But given the context of body autonomy and the potential for control, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
