We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.\n\nAfter dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. \n\nI'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their girlfriend an ultimatum about a nose ring. They're really grossed out by nose rings and it's a dealbreaker for them. The girlfriend feels like it's controlling and that she should be able to do what she wants with her body.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about autonomy vs. personal boundaries. The author is saying that even though they agree the girlfriend should control her body, they can't be in a relationship if she gets a nose ring. That seems like a big deal. But is it the author's place to dictate such a thing?\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to their own comfort and boundaries. If something is a dealbreaker for them, maybe they shouldn't be in a relationship where that's an issue. But on the other hand, can they really expect their partner to give up an expression of herself just because it makes them uncomfortable? The girlfriend argues that it's controlling, which makes sense because it's about her body. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by saying if she really wants it, she should do it, but that they'd break up. That's a tough position. It's possible they're just being honest about their feelings, but using a breakup as a consequence for a personal choice might be seen as extreme. The girlfriend's point about hypothetical injuries is a good counter\u2014she's pointing out that supporting her through something else would be expected, so why not support her in this choice? The author's response is that it's different, but maybe not justified.\n\nI think the key here is that while the author isn't wrong to have their own preferences, using a breakup as a consequence for a non-harmful personal choice (like getting a nose ring) could be seen as controlling. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're prioritizing their discomfort over their partner's autonomy in a way that's not about safety or health. So, maybe answer A.\n"
