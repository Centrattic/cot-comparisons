      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The situation is a discussion between the author and their significant other (SO) about cheating. The author's argument is that sleeping with someone else is always intentional or a result of changing circumstances, not an accident. They call it a deliberate act with no respect and are disgusted by it. The SO took offense, compared it to accidental murder, and argued that under certain situations, it can be accidental. The author got defensive and their SO accused them of cheating, leading to a more intense argument.\n\nFirst, I need to determine whether the author's statement was wrong. The key point here is the definition of \"accidentally\" sleeping with someone. In common language, people might say things like \"we ended up sleeping together\" when it wasn't the initial plan, but it's more about the sequence of events rather than a true accident. A true accident is when something happens without intention or awareness. For example, if someone were to physically sleep with another person by mistake, like confusing their identity in the dark, that's a stretch but possible. However, most cases of cheating involve some level of decision-making, even if it's impulsive. \n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme. Murder is a crime that can be accidental in the legal sense, like in self-defense without intent. Cheating, though, is a consensual act between two people, so the concept of accident doesn't fit as neatly. The author is emphasizing that there's an element of choice and awareness, which is valid. But the SO might be using \"accidental\" to mean something that wasn't planned but still happened, which can be a matter of perspective. \n\nThe author's use of words like \"disgusting\" and the strong reaction could be seen as judgmental. The SO's offense might stem from feeling that the author is dismissing their views or being too rigid. The author then overreacted by \"rioting back\" harder than necessary, which might have escalated the situation. They also mention the SO accused them of cheating when they were defensive, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's wrong to say that sleeping with someone can't be accidental. The author's stance is technically correct because consensual sexual activity requires intent. However, in personal relationships, such black-and-white statements can be hurtful, especially if the partner feels their experience or perspective is being invalidated. The argument here escalated because of the defensive and aggressive response from the author rather than a calm discussion. \n\nTherefore, while the author's initial statement has some validity, their reaction and the way the argument unfolded might place them at fault. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because of the heated response and the dismissal of their partner's viewpoint, even if the initial statement isn't entirely incorrect.\n"
