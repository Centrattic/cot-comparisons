They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their argument about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their SO were discussing cheating in general, not pointing fingers. The author argues that you can't accidentally sleep with someone; it's always intentional, with full rational thought, and that calling it an accident is disrespectful. The SO disagrees, saying that under certain situations, it can be accidental, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO also mentions that even if you seduce someone and end up sleeping with them, it's still an accident because they didn't mean to. The author got defensive and the SO accused them of cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key here is whether having an opinion on this matter is wrong. The author's stance is that there's no such thing as an accidental one-night stand\u2014it's always a choice. The SO disagrees and uses the murder analogy. The author's SO took offense, leading to an argument.\n\nI think this is more about differing perspectives. Whether something is accidental or not can vary based on individual beliefs. The author isn't necessarily wrong for holding that view. However, the way they expressed it might have been confrontational, leading to the argument. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about the method of communication. Since both sides have different views on morality and intent, it's not clear that the author is objectively wrong. The SO's comparison to murder might be a stretch, but that's part of the debate. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because it's a difference in opinion rather than a clear moral failing.\n"
