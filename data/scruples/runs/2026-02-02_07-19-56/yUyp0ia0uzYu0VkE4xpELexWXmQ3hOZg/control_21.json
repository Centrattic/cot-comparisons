They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation involves a disagreement with their SO about whether cheating can be accidental. The author argues that it's always intentional, while the SO thinks it can be accidental like accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. The author's stance is that any sexual encounter outside a committed relationship is a conscious choice, so there's no accident involved. The SO counters with examples where someone might get into a situation that leads to cheating without planning. The comparison to accidental murder is a strong analogy; the author might not agree with that comparison.\n\nI should think about consent and responsibility. The author believes that even if someone is in a situation, they have control over their actions. The SO argues that sometimes situations can lead people to act against their intentions. But is there such a thing as an accidental sexual encounter? Maybe if someone is blackout drunk and can't consent, but that's not the same as cheating. However, in the scenario described, the SO's example is about seduction without intent, so it's more about being led into a situation without planning to sleep with someone.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement is wrong. The author's point is that there's no accident in cheating, which is a moral stance. The SO's argument is that circumstances can lead to it. The question is whether the author is wrong in making that claim. Since the SO is comparing it to murder, which is a more severe analogy, but the author might not have considered the nuances of different situations. However, from a moral perspective, the author's position that intent matters is valid. But maybe the author is missing scenarios where someone might not have the presence of mind to make a decision, leading to accidental cheating. However, that's debatable. Legally, intent is crucial, but in relationships, the line might be blurry. The author's assertion might be too strict, but it's a matter of perspective. The SO's reaction is about the comparison to murder, which could be an overreaction, but the author's stance might be seen as not considering situational factors. However, the author's position is that it's always intentional, so in that case, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's a middle ground. The author's argument is that intent is there, so no accident. But if someone is in a situation where they lose control, maybe they can't be held fully responsible. However, that's a stretch. So, the answer is B.\n"
