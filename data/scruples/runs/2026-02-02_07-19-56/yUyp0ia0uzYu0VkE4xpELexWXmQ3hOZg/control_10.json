      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a discussion between the author and their significant other (SO) regarding whether sleeping with someone can be considered \"accidental\" or \"situational.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone can't be accidental because it's a deliberate act requiring rational thought and consent. They see it as a choice, not an accident. The SO, on the other hand, claims that in certain situations, like after drinking or being in a specific environment, someone might end up sleeping with another person without intending to. They compare it to accidental murder, which is a strong analogy and might be a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental.\" In real terms, can consensual sex ever be accidental? Well, maybe if there was a misunderstanding or if someone was incapacitated (like drunk), but that's not really an accident\u2014it's a violation. If both parties are conscious and aware, then they are making a choice. However, some might argue that in situations where people are under the influence or caught up in the moment, they might not have control over their actions, but that's different from an accident. Also, consent is a big factor. If someone is in a situation where they can't consent (like blackout drunk), then it's not consensual and thus not \"sleeping with someone\" in the right sense.\n\nThe author's SO is using the term \"accidental\" in a way that might be trying to justify or downplay intentional actions. The author is right to point out that if you're in a situation where you're engaging in sexual activity, even if it's not premeditated, you're still making a conscious decision. However, the author's response was to call it \"disgusting\" and lacking respect, which might have been harsh and offensive to the SO. The SO took offense, which led to an argument. The author admits to rioting back harder than necessary, so maybe they overreacted.\n\nNow, considering AITA questions, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable. The author's stance is factually correct in that consensual sex requires consent and thus isn't accidental. However, the way they expressed it (calling it \"disgusting\" and lacking respect) might have been disrespectful, leading to the SO's reaction. The SO's analogy to accidental murder is flawed but they might be trying to make a point that some people see their actions as outside their control. The author's harsh response might be where they went wrong, not the initial argument itself.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the initial statement, but their reaction was more problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone, the answer would depend on whether the statement itself is wrong. Since the author is correct in the literal sense that consensual sex isn't accidental, but their tone and response might have been the issue. But the question is about the initial statement, not the reaction. The SO's reaction might be over the top, but the author's initial statement is correct. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
