They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) regarding whether sleeping with someone can be considered an accident. The author argues that it's never accidental and requires intentional decisions, while the SO claims it's possible under certain situations, comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that any sexual activity is a conscious choice, so calling it an accident is invalid. They see it as a lack of respect and as something with full rational thought. On the other hand, the SO thinks that circumstances can lead to unintended outcomes, hence accidental sleeping with someone. The example given is like seduction leading to a situation where the person might not have intended to sleep together but did so because of the circumstances.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about intent and the definition of \"accidental.\" The author is firm that any action, including sleeping with someone, is a deliberate choice. The SO argues that context and situations can override intent. The author's response was to riot back, which escalated the situation, and the SO accused them of cheating when they were defensive.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the author's initial statement might have been a strong opinion, but expressing a differing view isn't inherently wrong. However, the way they reacted\u2014rioting back harder than necessary\u2014could be problematic. Arguments can become heated, and how each person responds matters. The author's SO took offense, which could be due to feeling judged or misunderstood. The author might not be in the wrong for having a different opinion, but the way they handled the conflict might have contributed to the escalation.\n\nThe comparison to accidental murder is extreme. Murder is typically considered a deliberate act, so using that analogy might be flawed. The SO's argument here could be seen as trying to justify unintended consequences, but the analogy might not hold. However, the author's dismissal of the SO's viewpoint as \"naive\" and calling them an idiot if they don't see it their way is confrontational and disrespectful. That could have caused the SO to feel attacked, leading to their defensive reaction.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties might have valid points, but the way they expressed their views led to conflict. The author's assertion might be seen as rigid, not allowing for different experiences or situations. However, the SO's example of seduction and situational factors leading to unintended sex might be a valid perspective for some people. The author's response, though, was overly defensive and aggressive, which is where the problem might lie.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's initial stance isn't necessarily wrong in terms of opinion, but their reaction\u2014rioting back and being defensive\u2014might be where they're at fault. The SO's offense could stem from feeling disrespected by the author's strong language. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the conflict rather than the opinion itself.\n"
