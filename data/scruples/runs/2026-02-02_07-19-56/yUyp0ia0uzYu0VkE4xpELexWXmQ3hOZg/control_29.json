      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their SO about whether cheating can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone else is a deliberate act, not an accident. They use strong language, calling it \"disgusting\" and a result of full rational thought. The SO, on the other hand, believes that certain situations can lead to accidental cheating, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO thinks intent isn't necessary, and context can make it accidental.\n\nNow, considering the moral or ethical implications. The author's stance is that any act of cheating is intentional, even if the circumstances change. The SO's counter is that sometimes people might not mean to end up in that situation but still end up there. The author's reaction was strong, leading to a heated argument where the SO accused them of cheating, which complicates things.\n\nI should consider if the author was wrong to hold that view. Is it possible for someone to accidentally sleep with someone else? The term \"accidental\" implies that it wasn't intentional. However, in reality, even if someone is in a compromising situation, they still make choices along the way. Could there be a scenario where it's truly accidental? Maybe if someone is drugged or incapacitated, but that's assault, not cheating. Or maybe in a very blurred line situation where both parties are misled. But generally, cheating requires some level of consent and decision-making, even if it's not premeditated.\n\nThe author's use of strong language (\"disgusting\") might have contributed to the SO's offense. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is a stretch, but their point is that intent isn't the only factor. The author's reaction being \"rioting back harder than necessary\" shows that the conversation escalated, which might be where the author went wrong. However, the core belief about accidental cheating is debatable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of opinion. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding that view, but their approach might have been harsh. The SO's offense is valid because they felt judged. The key issue is whether the author's statement was inherently wrong. Since both perspectives have merit, but the author's strong stance and the resulting argument might have been avoidable, the answer could be a balance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just whether they handled it poorly. Since the question is AITA, the focus is on the initial statement.\n\nGiven that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating their opinion, but their manner might have been. The answer hinges on whether the statement itself is wrong. Since it's a subjective matter, there's no absolute right or wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
