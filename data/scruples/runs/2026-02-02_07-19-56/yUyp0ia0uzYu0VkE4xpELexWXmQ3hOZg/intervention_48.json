      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their stance on whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author's SO is upset, comparing it to accidental murder. The author thinks it's always intentional, the SO thinks there are situations where it's not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. \"Accidental\" usually means unintended. So if someone ends up sleeping with someone without intending to, could that be considered an accident? The author argues no, it's always intentional or situational. The SO's example is about being seduced, getting somewhere, etc., without meaning to proceed. \n\nBut wait, if someone is in a situation where they didn't plan to sleep with someone but the circumstances led them there, is that really accidental? The author might see it as a lack of self-control or poor decision-making. However, others might argue that in the heat of the moment, people might act on impulse without prior intent. The comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, but it's meant to highlight that even if unintended, the action still happened due to the situation.\n\nThe author's response was defensive and possibly harsh. They called it \"disgusting\" and claimed no respect, which might have added to the SO's offense. The SO felt disrespected and accused the author of being naive. The argument escalated, leading the author to riot back, which they admit was unnecessary. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are whether the argument was justified. The author's initial statement is a matter of opinion, but the way they defended it might have been dismissive and harsh. The SO's perspective is valid in that people can act on impulse, and not all situations are premeditated. The author's refusal to consider that scenario might have been the root of the conflict. The author's defensive reaction and the comparison to murder could have been inflammatory. \n\nOn the other hand, the SO's example of \"accidentally\" sleeping with someone by being seduced might involve some level of consent and active participation, which complicates the \"accidental\" label. The author's stance that it's not accidental could be seen as more responsible, but the way they communicated it was problematic. The SO's offense is valid because the author dismissed their view without understanding their reasoning. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's position isn't inherently wrong, but their approach to the conversation and the subsequent reaction contributed to the conflict. However, the core argument about whether it's accidental is subjective. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to consider if that's the case. The answer might hinge on whether the author's opinion is wrong or just poorly expressed. Since the author's belief isn't factually incorrect, but their handling of the conversation was poor, maybe the answer is not wrong. But the user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, so I have to reconcile that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is wrong because they dismissed the possibility of situational factors entirely. In some contexts, situations can influence decisions, making it hard to label as purely intentional. The author's absolutist stance might be inflexible. The SO's example isn't about premeditation but circumstances leading to unintended actions. So, in that case, the author's position is too rigid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being too dismissive and not acknowledging situational factors. \n\nBut I'm a bit torn. The author's point is valid in that actions require intent, but the SO's point is about circumstances. Maybe both have elements. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial question says \"AITA for saying you can't 'accidentally' sleep with someone?\" So the author is taking a stance that it's never accidental. If the SO argues that in some cases it is, then the author is wrong to say it's never possible. Thus, the author is in the wrong because they dismissed a possibility that the SO is asserting. The answer would be A.\n"
