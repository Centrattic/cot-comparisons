They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author argues that it's never accidental and requires intent, while their SO disagrees and compares it to accidental murder. They had a big argument, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made a strong statement that sleeping with someone isn't an accident, which led to conflict. The SO took offense, brought up the comparison to accidental murder, and the author reacted strongly, leading to accusations of cheating. The question is about whose fault it is.\n\nI should consider communication in relationships. The author's stance seems pretty rigid, dismissing their partner's perspective. Maybe they could have expressed their opinion without being so judgmental. On the other hand, the SO's comparison to accidental murder might be hyperbolic and invalidating. But the author's reaction was also excessive, leading to a defensive response. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to listen and understand each other's viewpoints. The author's initial statement might have been too absolute, not leaving room for different experiences. The SO might be referring to situations where people engage in sex without planning to, maybe due to alcohol or emotional situations, but the author considers that intent is always there. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction of \"rioting back\" harder than necessary shows they escalated the conflict. They also took the accusation of cheating personally, which might have been an overreaction. The SO's argument isn't without merit, but the way both parties handled the discussion was problematic. \n\nThe key here is that both sides contributed to the conflict, but the question is specifically about the author's fault. The author's initial statement was a generalization that could be seen as dismissive of their partner's experience. They didn't consider that their partner might have a different perspective based on their own or others' experiences. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's tone and refusal to consider alternative viewpoints likely contributed to the argument. They might have been too quick to judge and not open to discussion. However, the SO's comparison to accidental murder is also an issue. But the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their approach was rigid and dismissive, leading to conflict. They failed to communicate effectively and respect their partner's perspective, which is crucial in such discussions.\n"
