They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The situation was a discussion between the author and their SO about cheating. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone must be intentional, not accidental, and they called it \"disgusting.\" The SO took offense, comparing it to accidental murder and arguing that situations can lead to it without intent.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's statement is inherently wrong. The author is asserting that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, not an accident. The SO counters that sometimes people get into situations where it happens unintentionally. The author's SO is upset because they feel the author is too rigid in their view, dismissing the possibility of situational factors.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they might believe that labeling it as an \"accident\" minimizes responsibility. They might think that even in a situation, the person still makes active choices. The SO, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being judgmental and not acknowledging that people can lose control or be influenced by circumstances beyond their initial intent.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is wrong. The author's statement isn't necessarily incorrect; it's a matter of perspective. Different people have different views on consent and intent. The problem here might be more about how the author communicated their opinion rather than the opinion itself. If the author was dismissive or used harsh language (\"disgusting\"), that could have contributed to the SO's offense. However, the core argument about intent versus situation is subjective. So, the author isn't factually wrong, but perhaps their delivery or the judgmental language caused conflict. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just the communication style. Since the opinion is debatable, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
