They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. They and their SO had a discussion about cheating. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone can't be accidental\u2014it's always intentional, with full rational thought and no respect. The SO disagrees, arguing that situations can lead to it being accidental, even comparing it to accidental murder. The SO's example is about seducing someone, getting to a place, and doing the deed, claiming it's accidental because the person didn't mean to do it.\n\nThe author thinks the SO is wrong and that the SO's view is naive. The SO took offense, leading to an argument where the author defended their position too harshly, causing the SO to accuse them of cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical implications. The author's position is that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, which might be a bit rigid. However, the SO's argument that it can be accidental by situation is more flexible. The author's response was to riot back harder, which escalated the conflict. The SO felt accused of cheating when they were just defending their viewpoint. The author's harsh reaction might have been the main issue here. While the initial argument might have valid points on both sides, the way the author defended their stance caused the problem. The key is whether the author is wrong in their initial statement or the way they handled the disagreement. Since the question is about being in the wrong generally, not just the argument's escalation, but the initial statement's validity.\n\nSome might argue that situations can influence decisions, making it a gray area. The author's insistence that it's never accidental might be too black-and-white, not accounting for impaired judgment or situational pressures. However, the SO's example of \"accidental\" as not intending to sleep with someone but ending up doing it because of the situation is debatable. The author's comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder is a criminal act, while sleeping with someone isn't inherently criminal. The author's harsh reaction and labeling the SO's view as naive could be seen as dismissive. So, the author's wrongdoing is more about the reaction than the initial belief, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. If the SO's viewpoint is considered valid by some, then the author's stance is too rigid, making them in the wrong. However, if the author's position is seen as a valid perspective, then it's the SO who's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether you think the initial statement is wrong. If the author's stance is too absolutist, then A (yes, in the wrong). If it's a matter of differing opinions, then B (no).\n"
