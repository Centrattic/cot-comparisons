They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a partner and their significant other about whether sleeping with someone can be considered an \"accident\" or a result of the situation versus a deliberate choice.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone isn't accidental\u2014it's a deliberate act, either with intent or due to changing circumstances. They see it as a choice made with rational thought. The SO, however, thinks that in certain situations, it can be accidental, comparing it to accidental murder. They use examples like seduction or being in a specific scenario where even if you didn't plan to sleep with someone, it happened because of the situation.\n\nNow, I need to consider societal perspectives. The author's stance is that any sexual activity is a conscious decision, which is a stricter view. The SO's view allows for situational influences where someone might not have intended to sleep with someone but ended up doing so due to pressure, alcohol, or other factors. This could relate to the concept of \"situational cheating\" where people might justify their actions based on the context.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong to hold their position. If we consider that people can make decisions under the influence or in altered states, maybe they don't fully realize their actions. However, the author's point is that even in those cases, there's a choice involved. The comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder requires intent, even if accidental, but that's not the case here. Sexual activity typically requires active participation.\n\nThe SO's argument relies on the idea that intent is absent, but the author is countering that intent is present in some form. The question is about morality and perspective. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their belief that it's a conscious choice. Disagreement doesn't mean they're wrong. The SO's strong reaction might stem from a different moral viewpoint, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for their stance. The answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
