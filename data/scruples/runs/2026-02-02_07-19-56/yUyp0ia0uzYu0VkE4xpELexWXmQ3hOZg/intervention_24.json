They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple discussing cheating, where the author argues that sleeping with someone can't be accidental, while their SO disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author believes that any sexual activity is a conscious decision, so it's not an accident. The SO argues that situational factors can lead to it happening without intent, like accidental murder. The author got defensive and was accused of cheating, leading to an argument.\n\nI should consider if the author's position is valid. The key point is whether consensual sex can be accidental. Legally, consent is a factor, but the term \"accidental\" usually implies lack of intent. If both parties are consenting, it's not accidental. However, the SO's comparison to accidental murder is a stretch because murder requires intent, but in that analogy, maybe they mean unintentional but resulting from the situation. That's a flawed comparison because murder is a crime, but the analogy might be trying to say that sometimes actions are influenced by circumstances beyond control.\n\nThe author's insistence that it's never accidental might be too rigid. People might believe they were \"swept away\" by the moment, even if they had some intent. But legally and ethically, it's a conscious choice. The SO's argument could stem from a belief in situational ethics or lack of control. The author's response was heated, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for holding that view? Maybe not in terms of their opinion, but the way they expressed it caused a rift. The SO took offense, so perhaps the author could have been more open to discussion. However, the core of the debate is about differing moral views. The author isn't necessarily wrong for having that opinion, but their reaction (rioting back) was excessive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance or their reaction.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider if the author's position is factually incorrect. If the author claimed that all such acts are intentional, that's a strong statement. But in reality, people might not have full control over their actions in certain situations, like under the influence or emotional states. However, consent is mutual, so it's not an accident from both sides. The author's view that it's always intentional is a valid moral stance, but the SO's view is also a perspective. So, the author isn't factually wrong, but maybe their approach was too rigid.\n\nThe answer would hinge on whether holding such a belief, despite differing opinions, is being wrong. Since both sides have valid points, the author isn't in the wrong for their opinion. The conflict arises from communication issues rather than one being objectively right. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
