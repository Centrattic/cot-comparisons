They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental or situational.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that any sexual encounter is intentional, not accidental, and that classifying it as an accident is disrespectful. Their SO disagrees, using the analogy of accidental murder to suggest that in certain situations, people might end up sleeping with someone without initially intending to, but still doing it because of the circumstances.\n\nThe author's SO uses the term \"accidental\" to describe scenarios where the situation changes once they're out and about. The author is firm in their stance, calling the SO's view naive. The conversation escalates, and the author responds more heatedly, leading the SO to accuse them of cheating when they become defensive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider if the author's stance is invalid. The key here is the definition of \"accidental\" in this context. The author believes that any sexual activity requires active decision-making, so it can't be accidental. The SO argues that under certain circumstances, people might not have the opportunity to make a conscious decision, hence calling it situational or accidental.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's perspective might be seen as rigid. People's behavior can be influenced by various factors, including peer pressure, emotional states, or circumstances that cloud judgment. The comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder requires intent, but sexual activity could be influenced by factors that reduce conscious control. However, the author's point is that even in those situations, there's a choice involved, so it's not truly accidental.\n\nThe author's response escalating the argument might be a problem. Even if they had a valid point, responding more heatedly than necessary could be seen as inconsiderate. The SO felt offended, which might indicate that the author's approach was harsh or dismissive of their perspective. The author's insistence on their viewpoint without acknowledging the complexity of the situation could contribute to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author might not be entirely wrong in their belief but could be wrong in how they communicated it. The SO's example of accidental sleeping with someone might be a stretch, but the author's reaction was unnecessarily aggressive. The SO's comparison to murder is a poor analogy, but the author's defensiveness led to accusations of cheating, which is a serious claim. \n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. They might be pointing out that the author's rigid stance and harsh reaction contributed to the problem. Even if the author's belief is understandable, the way they handled the disagreement was problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions (their reaction) were in the wrong, regardless of their initial stance. The SO's perspective might not be entirely valid, but the author's defensive and escalated response likely made things worse. So, the author is partially at fault for how they handled the conversation, even if their initial argument isn't entirely incorrect.\n"
