They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) regarding whether one can \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The author argues that you can't accidentally sleep with someone because it's always a deliberate act, while the SO thinks that under certain situations, it can happen accidentally, even comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They believe that sleeping with someone requires intention and rational thought, so it's not accidental. They find it disgusting if someone claims it was an accident. Their SO, on the other hand, thinks that situations can escalate, leading to it without prior intent. The SO uses the example of seduction and being in a situation where it happens, so they consider it accidental.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the definitions of \"accidental\" and \"situational.\" The author is taking a strict stance that any sexual encounter is intentional, while the SO is suggesting that context and circumstances can lead to it without prior intent. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, but maybe they're trying to say that sometimes actions are a result of circumstances rather than premeditation.\n\nThe author's response might have been too harsh, leading to an argument. The SO felt offended, which is valid because people might have different views on intent versus circumstances. The author called their SO's view naive and an idiot, which could have escalated things. Also, the author admitted to rioting back harder than necessary, which might make them at fault for the argument's escalation.\n\nBut is the author wrong in their initial statement? Well, whether or not it's possible to \"accidentally\" sleep with someone is subjective. Some people might feel pressured into situations they didn't intend, or maybe they thought they were in a committed relationship but it wasn't clear. However, the author's absolute stance that it's never accidental could be seen as dismissive of the SO's perspective. The SO might feel that their experiences or understanding of how situations unfold isn't acknowledged.\n\nThe term \"accidental\" in this context is tricky. If someone enters a situation with the intention to not sleep with the other person but ends up doing so due to the circumstances, does that count as accidental? The author might argue that even in heated moments, there's a choice involved. But the SO might feel that sometimes decisions are made impulsively, not considering all consequences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible both have valid points. The author's stance is more about accountability, while the SO's is about the complexity of human behavior. However, the author's reaction to the SO's view might have been too confrontational, leading to the argument. The SO felt their perspective was invalidated, which could mean the author was dismissive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for not respecting their SO's viewpoint and for escalating the argument. The initial statement might not be \"wrong\" in itself, but the way it was handled and the subsequent reaction could be where the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their response was too harsh and dismissive, leading to conflict.\n"
