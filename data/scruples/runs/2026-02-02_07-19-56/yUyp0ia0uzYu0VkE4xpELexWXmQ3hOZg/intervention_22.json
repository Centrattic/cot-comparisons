They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion that you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The scenario involves a disagreement between the author and their partner about whether cheating can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the argument. The author believes that sleeping with someone outside the relationship requires intent and isn't accidental. Their partner argues the opposite, using the analogy of accidental murder. The author's response was defensive, leading to conflict.\n\nI should think about consent and responsibility here. The author's stance is that cheating is a conscious choice, implying that there's no such thing as an accident. Their partner, however, thinks that situations can escalate without prior intent. The key here is whether the author's position is valid or if they're dismissing legitimate perspectives.\n\nThe partner's example of accidental murder is a bit extreme, but maybe they're trying to say that intentions aren't always clear. However, comparing cheating to murder might be an exaggeration. The author's reaction of being defensive and causing a bigger argument could indicate they didn't handle the disagreement well, even if their initial point had merit.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding their belief. If the author's belief is that cheating requires intent, that's a valid personal view. However, the way they reacted (rioting back, being defensive) might be where they went wrong, not necessarily the opinion itself. The problem could be in the delivery rather than the opinion.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in general. If the author's claim that it's never accidental is incorrect, then they might be in the wrong. However, from a moral standpoint, most people would agree that cheating is a choice, even if situations can lead to it. The partner's argument might be minimizing the role of intent, which the author is emphasizing.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for their belief? It's possible that there are situations where people might feel they were \"trapped\" into a situation, but the author's absolute stance that it's never accidental could be too rigid. However, the main issue here is the argument itself. The author's reaction was aggressive, but the question is about whether their opinion is wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's belief that sleeping with someone isn't accidental might not be entirely wrong, but their handling of the argument could be. However, based on the content of their belief, I think the author is correct in asserting that intentional action is involved, so they might not be in the wrong. But if the question is about the argument itself, maybe the answer is different. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the core opinion is defensible.\n"
