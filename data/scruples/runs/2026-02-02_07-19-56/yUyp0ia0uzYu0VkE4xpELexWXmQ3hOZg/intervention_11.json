They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and their SO regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author argues that it's always intentional or situational, while the SO claims it can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's position is that any sexual encounter requires conscious decision-making, so calling it an accident is wrong. The SO uses the analogy of accidental murder, suggesting that in certain situations, people might end up sleeping together without intending to. But comparing accidental murder to accidental sex seems problematic. Accidental murder is a real legal term, but does that analogy hold here?\n\nThe author's SO argues that even if someone seduces another person, it's still a choice, not an accident. The author is taking a hard line, saying it's never accidental. The SO takes offense, leading to a big argument. The author then reacts strongly, and the SO accuses them of cheating, which seems like a stretch.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key issue is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. The author's view is that any sexual activity is a conscious choice, so there's no such thing as an accident. The SO's counterexample of an accidental situation is questionable because even if someone is in a situation where they end up sleeping together, the decision to engage is still theirs. The author's point that it's always intentional makes sense, especially since legal systems typically require intent for many actions. However, people might have different perspectives. The author's SO might be using the term \"accidental\" to mean that external factors or circumstances led to the encounter, not that they were physically forced. But the author is right that it's a choice made in the moment, so calling it an accident is misleading.\n\nThe author's reaction might have been too harsh, but the initial statement that sleeping with someone can't be accidental isn't inherently wrong. However, the way the author expressed their opinion and the subsequent argument might have been more about the SO's interpretation than the author's actual stance. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is a problematic analogy because murder and sex have different contexts. The author's SO might be using hyperbole, but the author's response was defensive, leading to escalation.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's statement is factually correct (that it's not accidental), then they aren't wrong. However, if the SO's perspective is that they feel invalidated by the author's absolute stance, there might be room for compromise. But legally and ethically, the author's point holds that actions require intent. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
