They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for arguing that you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The scenario is a discussion between the author and their SO about cheating. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone isn't an accident and requires intent, while the SO argues that in certain situations, it can be accidental, comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. An accident typically implies a lack of intent or a mistake. If someone engages in sexual activity, it's usually a conscious choice, even if influenced by situational factors. The author's position is that there's no such thing as an accidental sexual encounter\u2014it's always a deliberate decision. The SO, however, thinks that under certain circumstances, people might not realize the consequences, hence calling it accidental. \n\nBut wait, even if someone is drunk or in a situation where they lower their inhibitions, the act of having sex still requires consent and active participation. So maybe the author is right in saying there's intent involved. However, the SO's comparison to murder is a bit extreme. Murder can be accidental in cases of negligence, but sexual activity isn't the same. The author's argument is that you can't accidentally sleep with someone because it's a choice, even if the decision is influenced by external factors.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. They might believe that situational factors can lead to non-intended sexual encounters, like under the influence or in a compromising situation. But the author's point is that even in those cases, the person is making a choice at each step. So, is the author in the wrong for dismissing the possibility of accidental sexual encounters? It's a matter of perspective. The key is whether intent is necessary for the act. If the author's stance is that there's no such thing as an accident in this context, they might be oversimplifying. However, the SO's argument that it's accidental might be minimizing their own agency in the situation. \n\nAlso, the argument escalated because the author reacted strongly. The SO might feel disrespected by the author's claim that their view is naive. The author's response of being defensive and the SO accusing them of cheating complicates things. But the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their initial statement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's position is that there's no accidental sex, which is a valid perspective, but the SO's counterargument isn't entirely wrong either. However, the author's insistence might come off as judgmental. Depending on the context and how it's framed, the author could be seen as in the right for emphasizing intent, but their reaction might be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on consent and agency.\n"
