They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a person and their significant other (SO) regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (the person writing the AITA post) argues that having sex with someone can't be accidental because it requires rational thought and intent. They think it's a conscious decision and call it \"disgusting,\" which might indicate a strong judgment. The SO, on the other hand, claims that in certain situations, like being in a bar or a party, it's possible to end up sleeping with someone without intending to, and even compares it to accidental murder. The SO uses the argument that even if you didn't plan it, the circumstances led to it, so it's still considered accidental.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here are the definitions of \"accidental\" in this context. The author is using a strict definition where any physical intimacy requires intent, so there's no room for accidents. The SO is using a more situational or circumstantial definition, where even if the intention wasn't there, the actions leading up to it might have been influenced by the environment or emotions, making it seem accidental.\n\nI should think about whether the author is being too rigid in their view. Is it possible that in some cases, people might not have intended to sleep with someone but ended up doing so due to situational pressures, like peer pressure, alcohol, or emotional states? The author's assertion that it's always intentional might not account for all scenarios. For example, if someone is under the influence of alcohol and makes poor decisions, they might later claim it was an accident or a mistake, even if they technically consented. That's a common debate in discussions about consent and responsibility.\n\nHowever, the author's strong language (\"disgusting,\" \"no respect\") might contribute to the conflict. Even if the author's point has some validity, the way they expressed it could be seen as judgmental and dismissive of their partner's perspective. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is an extreme analogy, but that might be their way of emphasizing their view that intent isn't the only factor.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely wrong in their belief that intent plays a role, but their approach in the conversation could be problematic. They might be oversimplifying the issue and not considering nuances. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong,\" which could mean both the stance and the manner.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both the validity of the argument and the behavior. If the author was dismissive and used harsh language, they might be seen as contributing to the conflict. The SO's reaction (\"rioting\") could be a result of feeling judged or not heard. The author's defensive response and the SO's accusation of cheating (even if not serious) might indicate that both parties escalated the situation.\n\nSo, the author's stance might not be completely wrong, but their handling of the conversation could be. The answer might depend on whether the question is about the opinion's validity or the behavior during the argument. If the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation (i.e., their actions and words), then maybe they are partially responsible. If it's about the correctness of their opinion, maybe not. But the AITA usually considers both.\n"
