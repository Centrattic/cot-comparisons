They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The main issue is the debate over whether sleeping with someone can be considered accidental. The author argues that it's always intentional, while their SO thinks it can be situational or accidental, even comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conversation was general, not directed at either partner. The author's stance is that any sexual encounter is a deliberate choice, not an accident. The SO, however, believes that circumstances can lead to it without direct intent, maybe through seduction or being in the right place at the right time. The comparison to accidental murder is a strong one, but that's a legal and moral concept where intent matters a lot. In law, there's a difference between murder and manslaughter based on intent. However, in personal relationships, the line might be more subjective.\n\nThe author and SO have a significant disagreement here. The author's insistence that it's never accidental might come off as rigid or not acknowledging the complexity of human behavior. The SO's argument that intent isn't necessary for it to be accidental might be a misunderstanding of what constitutes intent in such situations. The author's strong reaction and the SO's taking offense led to a heated argument. The author admitted to reacting more harshly than necessary, which could indicate they escalated the conflict, even if their initial point was from a place of principle.\n\nNow, considering who is in the wrong. The author's position is a matter of opinion, so there's no inherent right or wrong. However, the way the argument was handled might be where the fault lies. The author's claim that it's \"disgusting\" adds judgment, which could be hurtful. The SO's example of accidental murder is a problematic analogy because it's a stretch and might be using hyperbole. The author's defensive reaction leading to more conflict suggests they might have overreacted. But since the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their position, it's tricky. If the relationship has differing views on consent and intent, both sides might have valid points from their perspectives. However, in such disagreements, maintaining respect and understanding is key. The author's rigid stance without room for discussion might contribute to the conflict. So, while the author isn't necessarily wrong in their opinion, the way they handled the argument could be considered at fault.\n"
