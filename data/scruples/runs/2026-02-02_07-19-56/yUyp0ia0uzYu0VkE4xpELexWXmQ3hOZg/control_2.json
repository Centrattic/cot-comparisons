They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with their SO regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental or situational.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone isn't an accident; it's a deliberate act that requires rational thought and intent. Their SO, on the other hand, thinks that under certain circumstances, it can happen accidentally, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO's argument is that even if you're seducing someone and end up sleeping with them, if you didn't mean to, it's still an accident.\n\nThe author's SO took offense, and the conversation escalated. The author admitted to reacting more harshly than necessary. The SO even accused them of cheating because they were defensive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and common understandings. Cheating usually involves intent, but the definition can vary. Some people might see cheating as any sexual activity outside a committed relationship, regardless of intent. Others might argue that if it's a slip-up without prior intent, it's accidental. However, legally and ethically, even if someone claims it was accidental, the act itself is still a choice. The comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder is a crime with intent, whereas the comparison here is trying to equate a consensual act with a serious crime, which is a stretch.\n\nThe author's stance is that the act requires intent and isn't accidental. The SO's argument seems to hinge on the idea that situations can lead to unintended consequences. The problem arises from differing definitions. The author's SO might be using a more forgiving perspective where situational factors can override intent. The author is more rigid, seeing any sexual activity outside the relationship as a breach of trust, regardless of circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for holding that view. The author isn't cheating themselves, but they are expressing an opinion. The SO is upset because they perceive the author's view as not acknowledging the complexity of real-life situations. The author's reaction was defensive and harsh, which contributed to the conflict. However, the initial statement about intent vs. accident is a matter of perspective, not necessarily wrong.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, both sides have valid points. The author isn't wrong for believing that sexual activity requires intent, but they might not consider situations where emotions or circumstances cloud judgment. However, since the author isn't the one who cheated, but rather is expressing their opinion, which is valid even if it's not the same as their partner's, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). They might need to work on communication, but the stance itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
