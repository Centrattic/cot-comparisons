They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a disagreement with their SO about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author says it's not possible, while the SO argues it can be. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone isn't accidental\u2014it's a deliberate choice. They argue that even if the situation changes, it's still a conscious decision. The SO, on the other hand, compares it to accidental murder, suggesting that under certain circumstances, people might end up sleeping with someone without intending to. They use the example of seduction and being in a situation where it happens, claiming it's not premeditated but a result of the environment.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The key here is the definition of \"accidental\" versus \"situational.\" The author is firm that it's not accidental, while the SO is using a more flexible definition where external factors lead to the action without initial intent. \n\nIn real life, people often use \"accidental\" in different ways. Some might mean a complete lack of intent and awareness, while others might use it more loosely for situations where intent was there but not premeditated. The author's position is that any sexual encounter requires intent at some level, making it not accidental. The SO's argument is that the circumstances can push someone into it without prior intent, hence \"situational.\"\n\nThe author's statement that it's \"disgusting\" and lacks respect might have contributed to the SO's offense. The author's strong language could have made the discussion more confrontational. Additionally, the author reacted strongly, which might have escalated the situation. The SO's example of accidental murder is hyperbolic but used to make a point. The author's defensiveness when accused of cheating suggests the conversation took a turn into personal attacks, which isn't helpful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong not because their stance is inherently incorrect, but because of how they communicated it and reacted. The absolutist statement that it's never accidental, combined with disrespectful language, could make the author partially at fault. Also, escalating the argument instead of listening might tip the balance. However, there's a valid debate about the semantics of \"accidental\" here. But given the context of the argument and the reactions involved, the author's approach was problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
