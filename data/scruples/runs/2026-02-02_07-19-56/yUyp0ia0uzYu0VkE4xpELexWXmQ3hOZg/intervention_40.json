They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their significant other (SO) had a discussion about cheating. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone isn't an accident; it's intentional or situational but not accidental. The SO disagreed, arguing that it can be accidental, similar to accidental murder. The author got defensive, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's statements were wrong. The author's main point is that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, not an accident. They called it \"disgusting,\" which might have been harsh. The SO felt offended and compared it to accidental murder, suggesting that sometimes people might not intend to sleep with someone but end up doing so due to the situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for their perspective. The author's position is valid in that most actions, including sexual ones, require some level of consent and decision-making. However, the term \"accidental\" in this context is debatable. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is an extreme analogy, but it's a way to argue that sometimes people might not intend to commit an act but do so under the circumstances. \n\nBut the author's response was to dismiss the SO's viewpoint, leading to a defensive and harsh reaction. The author might have been wrong in their approach, perhaps not considering the nuance in the SO's argument. The use of strong language like \"disgusting\" could have escalated the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's point isn't entirely incorrect. Most people would agree that sexual activity requires some level of active participation. However, the way the argument was handled might have been the issue. The author's SO felt that their perspective was invalidated, leading to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely wrong in their belief, but the manner in which they expressed it could be problematic. The SO's feelings were hurt, and the author's defensive reaction worsened the situation. So while the author's stance isn't factually incorrect, their approach in the discussion might have been the main issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's perspective is seen as dismissive or invalidating, even if they have a point, they might still be in the wrong for how they handled the conversation.\n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario. The SO's argument about accidental sleep might not be realistic, but the author's response was overly harsh. The author could have acknowledged that while it's not purely accidental, there are situations where people might make poor choices under the influence, but that's still a choice. However, the author's use of \"disgusting\" and dismissing the SO's opinion entirely might be the main problem here. So the author's wrong might not be in their belief but in their communication style and unwillingness to consider nuance.\n"
