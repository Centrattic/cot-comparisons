They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for their argument about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that sleeping with someone can't be an accident. They argue it's always a conscious choice, regardless of the situation. The SO disagrees, using the analogy of accidental murder and suggesting that under certain circumstances, people might end up sleeping together without fully intending to.\n\nI need to evaluate the reasoning here. The key issue is the definition of \"accidental\" in this context. If the SO is saying that someone didn't mean to sleep with the person at the time but ended up doing so due to the situation, does that qualify as an accident? Or is the author right that such actions require conscious decision-making, making it impossible to be accidental?\n\nIn legal terms, \"accident\" usually implies an unintended consequence without intent. However, in a relationship context, the line can be blurry. People might argue that under the influence of alcohol, emotional stress, or other situational factors, someone might lose control or not think clearly, leading to actions they didn't plan. But the author counters that even in such cases, there's a level of conscious choice involved, making it not truly accidental.\n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder involves intent, even if it's not premeditated. However, accidental murder might occur due to negligence or a mistaken action, which is different from a consensual act like sleeping with someone. The analogy might be weak here.\n\nThe author's perspective is that any sexual activity requires conscious participation, so calling it accidental is a way to justify the action. The SO's argument might stem from the idea that sometimes people can be swept up in the moment, leading to unintended consequences. But the author believes that's an excuse.\n\nIs the author wrong for holding this view? It depends on societal norms and personal values. The author isn't wrong for having their opinion, but perhaps they were too rigid in dismissing their SO's perspective. The SO might feel that their view is valid and the author was too judgmental. The argument escalated because both sides didn't see eye to eye, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't do anything wrong per se; they expressed their opinion. However, the way they reacted (rioting back) might have been overly harsh, which could be where the fault lies. The SO took offense, possibly because they felt judged or invalidated. The author's insistence that situations can't lead to accidental sleepovers might come off as dismissive of the SO's experience or feelings.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's stance is objectively wrong or just a disagreement in values. Since both sides have valid points, but the author's insistence and the SO's reaction led to conflict, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, their defensive and harsh reaction could be seen as contributing to the problem. The question is whether their initial statement was wrong. The answer is B (No), but with the nuance that their reaction might be problematic.\n"
