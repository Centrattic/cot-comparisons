They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. They had a disagreement with their significant other (SO) about whether cheating can be accidental. The author argues that sleeping with someone is always intentional, not accidental, and that claiming it's an accident is disrespectful. The SO disagrees, saying that under certain situations, it can happen without intent and compares it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions of \"accidental\" in this context. If someone claims they didn't mean to sleep with someone, does that make it accidental? The author's stance is that any sexual encounter involves conscious decisions, so it's not accidental. The SO's argument is that situations can lead to it without prior intent, hence making it accidental. The comparison to accidental murder is a strong analogy but might be flawed because murder is typically considered intentional unless proven otherwise, whereas sexual encounters might have more gray areas.\n\nThe author's response was defensive and harsh, leading to the SO accusing them of cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because the author dismissed the SO's perspective and escalated the argument. The key points to evaluate are whether the author's statement was valid and if their reaction was appropriate.\n\nThe author's main point is that any sexual activity is a choice, so it can't be accidental. However, some people might argue that under the influence of alcohol, emotional vulnerability, or other factors, someone might engage in a sexual act without fully intending to, hence classifying it as accidental. The author's dismissal of the SO's counterarguments and the comparison to murder might have been seen as dismissive and invalidating, which could be why the SO took offense.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's statement was a personal opinion without attacking the SO's experiences, maybe not. But the way the argument escalated and the author's defensive response might indicate that they were in the wrong. Also, the comparison to accidental murder is problematic because it's a stretch and could be seen as minimizing the SO's valid perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's viewpoint is a personal belief, their rigid stance and the way they handled the disagreement led to conflict. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author didn't consider the SO's perspective and reacted in a way that caused harm, even if their initial statement was a belief they held.\n"
