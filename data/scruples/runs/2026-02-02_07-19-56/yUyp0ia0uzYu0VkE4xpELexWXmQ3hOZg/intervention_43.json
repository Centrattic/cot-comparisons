They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their argument about whether sleeping with someone can be an accident. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author says you can't accidentally sleep with someone. They argue that it's always intentional, even if the situation changes. The SO disagrees, comparing it to accidental murder and saying it's possible if you're in a certain situation. The author got defensive, maybe overreacted, and the SO accused them of cheating. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about definitions of \"accidental\" and the context. The author's stance is that any sexual encounter requires conscious decision-making, so it's not accidental. The SO believes that under certain pressures or situations, it could happen without full intent, hence \"situational.\"\n\nI need to consider if the author's position is valid. For example, if someone is drunk or in a compromised state, they might not make clear decisions. But legally, consent is a big factor. If someone is too intoxicated to consent, it's not considered mutual, but the author is talking about \"accidental\" in terms of intent. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, since murder is a crime and intent is a factor. But the analogy might not hold because sexual acts are different from murder. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction was to riot back harder than necessary, leading to accusations of cheating. That seems like an overreaction, which complicates things. Even if the initial point has some truth, the way they responded might have been problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for holding their opinion, but their response to the disagreement escalated things. The SO's argument that it's a \"result of the situation\" might have some validity if considering situational influences like peer pressure, alcohol, or emotional vulnerability. However, the author might argue that there's still intent involved, even if it's not premeditated.\n\nIt's a nuanced issue. Legally, consent and intent are crucial. But in the context of the relationship, the way they handled the discussion led to conflict. The author's stance might be seen as rigid, not allowing for the complexity of human behavior. The SO's example of \"seduce a person, get somewhere, etc.\" might be stretching the definition of accidental. But the author's point is that there's always some level of intent, even if it's not planned.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for their initial argument, but their reaction (rioting back harder) was definitely part of the problem. The SO's argument might have some merit in considering situational factors, but the comparison to accidental murder is flawed. So the answer might hinge on whether the initial statement is wrong, or just the reaction afterward.\n"
