They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between them and their SO regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author argues it's always intentional, while the SO believes it can be situational or accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, so calling it an accident is wrong. The SO counters with examples where someone might be seduced or in a situation where things escalate without prior intent. The comparison to accidental murder is a strong metaphor, implying that sometimes actions can be unintended but still occur. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is understanding the nuances of intent versus circumstances. The author's stance is rigid, dismissing the possibility of situational factors influencing behavior. The SO's argument is that context matters, and people might engage in actions they didn't plan due to the environment or pressure. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, suggesting that the author's position is too absolute. But maybe the issue isn't about who's right but how they handled the argument. The author admitted to rioting back harder than necessary, which might have escalated the conflict. However, the initial disagreement stems from differing views on morality and ethics. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author was dismissive and didn't consider their SO's perspective, that could be problematic. However, if the SO's view is that the author's stance is unrealistic, then the author's rigidity might be the issue. The comparison to accidental murder is a stretch, but people might use such metaphors to emphasize their point. \n\nThe author's response being overly defensive and causing the SO to accuse them of cheating suggests that communication broke down. Even if the author's viewpoint isn't inherently wrong, the way they reacted might be. But the core of the question is whether the author's initial position is wrong. \n\nConsidering that human behavior can be complex, with intent and circumstances interacting, the author's absolute stance that it's never accidental might not account for all scenarios. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the possibility of situational factors, even if they believe cheating is always intentional. However, if the author's main point is about respecting relationships and not using excuses, their stance might be valid from their perspective. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because their position is too rigid, not allowing for the complexity of human actions. But the SO's comparison might be flawed. Still, the author's refusal to consider situational aspects could be the issue here.\n"
