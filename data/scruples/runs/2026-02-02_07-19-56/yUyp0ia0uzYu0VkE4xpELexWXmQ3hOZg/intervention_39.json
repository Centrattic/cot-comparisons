They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a disagreement between the author and their significant other regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone isn't an accident because it's a conscious decision made with full rational thought, and they call it \"disgusting.\" Their SO disagrees, saying that under certain situations, it can be accidental, even comparing it to accidental murder. The SO's example includes seduction, being in a place where it happens, etc., and claims the person didn't mean to do it.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of \"accidental\" and the context of consent and intent. Legally and ethically, consent is crucial. If someone is in a situation where they are pressured or manipulated, it might be considered non-consensual, but the term \"accidental\" here is tricky. Intentionality is a big factor. The author is taking a strict stance that any sexual activity is intentional because it requires active participation. The SO is suggesting that external pressures or situations can lead someone to make a choice they didn't intend to make, hence \"accidental.\"\n\nI need to consider if the author's position is valid. The author's argument is that there's no such thing as an accidental sexual encounter because both parties have to consent, and thus it's a deliberate choice. However, the SO's perspective is that in the heat of the moment or under certain circumstances (like being in a bar or a party), someone might end up in a situation where they don't plan on sleeping with someone but it happens. The comparison to accidental murder is hyperbolic but highlights the difference in how intent is perceived.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's statement that it's \"with no respect\" and \"disgusting\" might come off as judgmental, which could contribute to the conflict. The SO taking offense might be because the author is dismissing their perspective without considering situational factors. The author's reaction of rioting back and being defensive might have escalated the situation, leading to the accusation of cheating, which is a serious claim.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's viewpoint is a matter of opinion. However, the way they expressed it, especially calling it \"disgusting\" and not respecting the SO's perspective, could be seen as inconsiderate. The SO's argument that intent isn't the only factor and that situations can influence decisions is valid in many psychological and sociological contexts. So the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that nuance and for being dismissive. Also, the reaction escalating the argument suggests that the author could have handled the discussion better.\n\nBut I should also consider that the author's stance isn't entirely without merit. Consent is a mutual decision, and if both parties are agreeing, then it's a choice. However, the term \"accidental\" in this context is more about unintended consequences rather than a lack of intent. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder is a serious crime, and even if it's accidental, it's still a result of actions. But in sexual contexts, the idea that someone might not plan to sleep with someone but end up doing so due to the situation is more about how people perceive their own agency in different scenarios.\n\nThe author's statement that it's done \"with no respect\" and being called naive by the SO indicates a clash in values. The author's position might be based on personal ethics, but dismissing the SO's experience as impossible could be seen as invalidating. The key issue here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong for their beliefs but in how they expressed them and reacted to the disagreement.\n\nIn conclusion, while both perspectives have elements of truth, the author's dismissive and judgmental tone, along with the defensive reaction, likely contributed to the conflict. The SO's argument about situational factors leading to unintended outcomes is a valid psychological perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that nuance and for escalating the argument.\n"
