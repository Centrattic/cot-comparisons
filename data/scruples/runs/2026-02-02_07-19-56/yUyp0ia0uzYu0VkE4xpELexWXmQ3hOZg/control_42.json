They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for their argument about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) about the concept of accidental infidelity.\n\nFirst, the author argues that sleeping with someone isn't accidental; it's always intentional or situational, and they find the idea of accidental cheating disrespectful. The SO, on the other hand, compares it to accidental murder and insists that under certain circumstances, it can happen without intent. They even give an example where someone might be seduced, end up in a situation, and sleep with someone unintentionally. The author took offense and got defensive, leading to an argument where the SO accused them of being naive or an idiot, and the author responded more intensely than necessary. Now, the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nTo evaluate this, I need to consider both sides. The core issue is the definition of \"accidental\" behavior. The author's stance is that any sexual encounter requires intent, so calling it accidental is a way to justify cheating. The SO's argument is that sometimes people can find themselves in situations that lead to infidelity without conscious intent. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's perspective isn't inherently wrong. They have a valid point that actions leading to infidelity usually involve some level of decision-making. However, the problem here isn't just the argument's content but how it was handled. The author's response was defensive, leading to a riot, and the SO felt accused of cheating. The key here is the emotional impact and communication style. Even if the author's viewpoint isn't factually incorrect, the way they expressed it caused harm, which might make them at fault in the relationship context.\n\nThe SO's use of the accidental murder analogy is problematic because it's a stretch and could be seen as minimizing the seriousness of cheating. However, their perspective is that circumstances can lead to actions without malicious intent. The author's strong reaction and defensiveness might have been unnecessary, escalating the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, how arguments are handled is crucial. Even if the author's initial point is valid, their response was overly aggressive, leading to the SO feeling attacked. The SO's reaction, while perhaps over the top, might stem from feeling that the author didn't acknowledge their viewpoint. \n\nSo, considering both the content and the manner of the argument, the author might be at fault for responding too harshly. While the initial disagreement isn't inherently wrong, the way it was handled could be seen as the author's fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the defensive and aggressive response, even if the initial argument isn't entirely invalid.\n"
