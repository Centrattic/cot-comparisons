They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) about whether sleeping with someone can be considered accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that any sexual encounter is intentional, requiring rational thought and choice, so calling it an accident is wrong. They see it as a deliberate act, not something that happens without intent. The SO, on the other hand, believes that in certain situations, like being seduced and ending up in a scenario where it happens without prior intent, it can be accidental. They compare it to accidental murder, implying that intent isn't present despite the outcome.\n\nI should consider if the author's stance is valid. The key here is the definition of \"accidental.\" In everyday language, people might use \"accidental\" to describe unplanned actions, but legally and morally, actions that lead to consequences usually require intent or recklessness. For example, if someone is physically capable of stopping but doesn't, it's not an accident. However, in some contexts, people might use \"situational\" to mean that circumstances led to the act without prior intent. The author is challenging the use of \"accidental\" as a defense for cheating, which is a common debate.\n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is a strong analogy. Murder requires intent, so calling it accidental doesn't fit legally. But in other scenarios, people might argue that if someone didn't plan to commit murder but it happened due to the situation, it's not their fault. However, this is a flawed comparison because even if it's not premeditated, there's usually some level of intent or negligence involved.\n\nThe author's reaction caused a conflict, leading to accusations of cheating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their initial statement. The author's main point is that cheating isn't accidental, which is a valid opinion. However, the way the conversation escalated, with the author \"rioting back harder than necessary,\" suggests that their reaction might have been excessive. But the initial statement itself is a matter of opinion. The SO's offense might be due to personal beliefs, but the author isn't wrong for holding that view. \n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have valid points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their stance. The core issue is differing opinions on the semantics of \"accidental\" in the context of cheating. The author's mistake might be in the intensity of the reaction, but the initial statement is a matter of perspective. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
