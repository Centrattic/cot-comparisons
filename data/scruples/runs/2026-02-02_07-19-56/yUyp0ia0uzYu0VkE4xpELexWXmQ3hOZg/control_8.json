      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong after a disagreement with their SO (significant other) about whether sleeping with someone can be an accident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone can't be accidental because it requires conscious decisions and actions. They mention things like going out with the intention to sleep with someone, or situations changing once out, but insist it's always a choice made with rational thought. They call it \"disgusting\" if it's done without respect. The SO disagrees, saying that in certain situations, it can be accidental, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO's argument is that even if you didn't plan to sleep with someone, the situation could escalate, and they can still claim it was accidental because they \"didn't mean to.\"\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The key points here are about consent, intent, and definitions of \"accidental.\" The author's stance is that any sexual activity is intentional, which is a strict view. The SO introduces the idea that circumstances can lead to unintended outcomes. The comparison to accidental murder seems hyperbolic, as murder is a legal term where intent matters. However, in the context of consensual sex, the line between intention and situational factors can be blurry.\n\nThe author's response was to riot back and become defensive when the SO accused them of being naive. The SO felt the author was being rigid and dismissive. The author's use of strong language (\"disgusting,\" calling the SO an idiot) might have escalated the conflict. However, the SO's analogy to murder is problematic because it's not a fair comparison\u2014sexual activity is consensual, and murder is not. The SO's argument that \"didn't mean to\" doesn't absolve responsibility in consensual contexts. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding their view, but their reaction (rioting back) was unhelpful. The SO's comparison to murder is a flawed analogy. The core issue is whether actions that lead to sexual activity can be considered accidental. Legally, consent requires intent, so even if someone claims it was accidental, both parties must consent. But the author's absolute stance that there's no such thing as an accidental sexual encounter might not account for situations where both parties consent but it wasn't premeditated. However, the author's dismissive attitude and the SO's overreaction both contributed to the conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for their belief, but their defensive response was excessive. The SO's argument has flaws, but their reaction was also over the top. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's core argument isn't factually incorrect (intent is required for consent), but their response was harsh, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about who was more reasonable. Since the author's position isn't wrong in terms of the logic (intent is required for sexual activity), the answer is B.\n"
