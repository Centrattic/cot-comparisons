They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on a specific situation involving their SO. The author made a strong statement that you can't accidentally sleep with someone, arguing it's a deliberate act. The SO disagreed, using the analogy of accidental murder. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's main point is that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, not an accident. The SO, on the other hand, believes that situational factors can lead to unintended consequences, hence \"accidental\" sex. The SO's argument is that even if you didn't plan it, the situation can lead to it happening without prior intent.\n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental.\" The author sees intent as necessary for it to be intentional, while the SO thinks that being in a certain situation can lead to it without prior planning. The author's statement might come off as judgmental, using words like \"disgusting\" and implying a lack of respect. That could have been offensive to the SO, especially if they felt it was a personal attack.\n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is a strong analogy, though it might be hyperbolic. It's possible they were trying to emphasize that even if you don't plan it, the situation can lead to it. However, the author might see this as trivializing serious issues like murder by comparing it to sex. That could escalate the conflict.\n\nThe author's reaction was to \"riot back harder,\" indicating a defensive and possibly aggressive response. The SO then accused them of cheating, which adds another layer of conflict. The question is whether the initial statement was wrong. The author's stance is about intent and responsibility, but their language and reaction might have been harsh, leading to the argument.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone claims a sexual encounter was a mistake or situation-driven, the author's perspective holds that it's a choice. However, the way the author expressed this, especially calling it \"disgusting\" and attacking the SO's reasoning, could be seen as invalidating their experience or feelings. The SO's offense is understandable if they felt judged or misunderstood.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's initial statement isn't factually wrong in terms of intent being a factor, but the way they delivered it and the language used may have been hurtful. The SO's perspective also has validity in acknowledging that situational factors can influence actions. The conflict arose from differing definitions and the author's judgmental tone. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the approach, even if their point about intent has some merit.\n"
