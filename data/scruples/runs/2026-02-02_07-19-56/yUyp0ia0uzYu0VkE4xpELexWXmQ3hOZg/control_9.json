They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing the possibility of cheating and whether it can be considered an accident. The author argues that you can't accidentally sleep with someone because it's a conscious decision, while their SO claims it can happen due to situations and compares it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's stance is that any sexual encounter is a deliberate act, not accidental. Their SO counters that under certain circumstances, like being in a situation where things escalate, it could happen unintentionally. The SO uses the analogy of accidental murder, implying that intent isn't always there, even if actions lead to a result.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, it's subjective. The concept of \"accidental\" in this context is debatable. If someone's actions lead to sleeping with another person without prior intention, does that count as an accident? The author might argue that even if intentions change during the situation, it's still a choice made at the moment, not an accident. The SO's comparison to murder is a strong analogy but might not hold in practical terms since murder is a criminal act where intent is a key factor. Sexual relations don't carry the same legal framework, but the analogy is meant to highlight the difference in intent.\n\nThe author's SO might be right that people can be in situations where they didn't initially intend to have sex but end up doing so. However, the author's point is about respecting the decision-making process and the intention behind actions. The key here is whether \"accidental\" is a valid term here. Legally, consent is required for sexual activity, which implies a conscious decision. So in that sense, it's not an accident because consent is given, even if the person didn't plan for it. But in social terms, people might use \"accidental\" to mean that the situation led to it without prior intent.\n\nThe author's SO's argument might stem from a belief that sometimes people lose control or are influenced by the moment, leading to actions they didn't plan. The author's strong reaction suggests they value intentionality and respect in such matters. The conflict here is more about differing perspectives on human behavior and accountability.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The author isn't necessarily wrong for holding their view, but their SO isn't wrong for believing otherwise. However, the author's insistence that it's never accidental might be seen as dismissing the SO's experience or perspective, which could be where the problem lies. The author's response was defensive and led to accusations of cheating, which might indicate a harsh reaction rather than a wrong belief.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. The issue is more about differing viewpoints rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
