They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) regarding whether cheating can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone else is always a deliberate act, not an accident, and that comparing it to accidental murder is extreme. The SO, on the other hand, believes that under certain circumstances, it could be accidental, like being in a situation where things escalate without intention.\n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental\" in the context of cheating. The author sees it as a conscious decision, while the SO argues that external factors or situations might lead to it unintentionally. The SO used the analogy of accidental murder, which the author finds problematic. \n\nI should consider if the author's stance is too rigid. Maybe there are scenarios where someone might not intend to cheat but ends up in a situation that leads to it. However, the author's point is that even in such cases, there's a choice involved, so it's not truly accidental. \n\nThe SO's argument about not meaning to do it could imply a lack of responsibility, which the author rightly challenges. Comparing cheating to accidental murder might trivialize the intentional nature of both actions. The author's strong reaction might stem from the belief that cheating is a deliberate act, not an accident.\n\nBut the author's response was defensive and led to an argument. They admitted to overreacting (\"rioted back, much harder than necessary\"). The SO felt accused of cheating, which complicates things. The author's initial statement might have been a general opinion, but the way they enforced it led to conflict. \n\nIs the author wrong in their opinion? Not necessarily, but in the way they communicated it. The problem might be more about how the argument escalated. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their stance, not just their reaction. \n\nIf the core issue is the belief that cheating can't be accidental, some might argue that situations can influence actions, making it debatable. But others might agree with the author that it's always a choice. However, since the SO took offense and felt accused, the author's approach might have been too dismissive of their perspective. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at intent and behavior. The author's initial statement was a personal opinion, but the way they enforced it led to conflict. They might not be \"in the wrong\" for their opinion, but their reaction might be. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the initial statement and the subsequent argument. \n\nConsidering the options A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No), the answer might hinge on whether the opinion itself is wrong. If the author's view is too rigid and ignores situational factors, they might be at fault. But if they're standing by their belief that intent matters, they might not be. However, the comparison to accidental murder is problematic, and the author's defensiveness escalated things. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because while having the opinion is okay, the way it was presented and the subsequent argument shows a lack of consideration for the SO's feelings and perspectives, leading to conflict unnecessarily.\n"
