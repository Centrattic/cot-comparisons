They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether sleeping with someone can be considered an accident. The author argues that you can't accidentally sleep with someone; it's always a conscious decision. Their partner disagrees, saying that in certain situations, it can be accidental, comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. What does \"accidental\" mean here? An accident usually implies unintentional actions without intent. But sleeping with someone is a deliberate act, right? Even if someone is drunk or in a situation where they think they're in a relationship, isn't there still some level of intent? The partner's example about seduction and getting somewhere suggests that there's some intention involved, even if they claim they didn't mean to sleep with the person. But maybe the partner is thinking of situations where someone gets into a situation they didn't plan, like maybe a one-night stand that wasn't intentional? But even then, someone has to consciously decide to have sex. If someone is blackout drunk, could they be considered to have accidentally slept with someone? But that's more about consent and responsibility, not necessarily intent.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's always a conscious decision, so there's no accident. The partner is pushing back, maybe thinking of scenarios where the decision wasn't premeditated but still happened in the moment. However, even in the moment, the decision to have sex is a choice. The comparison to accidental murder is a bit of a stretch because murder is a criminal act that can be accidental (like in self-defense without intent), but sleeping with someone is a consensual act (assuming it's consensual here). So maybe the partner's analogy is flawed.\n\nThe author's SO took offense, which might be because they felt the author was dismissing their perspective or being judgmental. The author's reaction was defensive, leading to a conflict. The question is whether the author was wrong in their stance. The key points are: Is there such a thing as an accidental sexual encounter? If someone says they didn't mean to sleep with someone but did, is that valid?\n\nI think the author's perspective is more about the necessity of intent, while the partner is considering situational factors. But in reality, any sexual act requires some level of intent, even if it's spur-of-the-moment. So the author isn't entirely wrong in their assertion. However, the way they presented it might have been dismissive of the partner's experiences or scenarios they were describing. The partner might feel invalidated, leading to the offense. So while the author's argument has merit, their delivery and the conflict escalation might be where they went wrong. The answer might depend on whether the author's stance, though correct in some way, caused unnecessary harm in the relationship by not considering nuances. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled the disagreement rather than the content of their argument. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Alternatively, maybe the author is not wrong because they have a valid point about intent, but their approach was flawed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation, which includes both the argument and the resulting conflict.\n"
