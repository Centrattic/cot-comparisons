They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about whether sleeping with someone can be considered an accident or situational, leading to a conflict between the author and their significant other (SO).\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that consensual sexual activity isn't accidental\u2014it's a deliberate choice. They compare it to not being able to \"accidentally\" go out with the intention to sleep with someone, emphasizing rational thought and intent. On the other hand, the SO believes that under certain circumstances, like when a situation changes, one might end up sleeping with someone without prior intention, hence \"accidental\" or situational. The SO even compares it to accidental murder, implying that intent isn't always the case.\n\nThe author's SO took offense, feeling that the author is being judgmental and not understanding the nuances of how situations can escalate. The author then defended their stance more aggressively, leading to the SO accusing them of cheating, which the author denies.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's initial statement was inherently wrong or harmful. The author's point is about intent in sexual activity, which is a valid discussion topic in relationships. However, the way they expressed it might have been dismissive of the SO's perspective. Using strong language like \"disgusting\" could have been hurtful, and the comparison of accidental sleeping to accidental murder might not be the best analogy, as it could minimize the SO's feelings.\n\nThe author's reaction was defensive and overly aggressive, which contributed to the conflict. While the initial disagreement might not be entirely the author's fault, the escalation and harsh language likely played a role in the argument. The SO's perspective is also valid in that people can make decisions based on the moment, even if they didn't plan it in advance. The author's refusal to acknowledge that possibility might have been disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. The author could have approached the discussion with more openness, while the SO could have communicated their feelings without feeling judged. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's stance isn't factually incorrect, but the manner in which it was delivered and the subsequent defensive reaction are problematic. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the conflict.\n"
