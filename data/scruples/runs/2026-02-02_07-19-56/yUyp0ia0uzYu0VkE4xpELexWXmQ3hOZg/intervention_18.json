They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their argument about accidental cheating. The author's main point is that sleeping with someone can't be accidental, while their SO argues that in certain situations, it can be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author believes that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, so it's not accidental. They think it's a result of rational thought and intent, and they're upset that their partner thinks otherwise. The SO, on the other hand, uses the analogy of accidental murder to suggest that someone could be in a situation where they end up sleeping with someone without intending to, and that's considered an accident.\n\nThe user, the one asking the question, thinks the author is in the wrong. They might be considering that maybe the author was too rigid in their stance or didn't consider other perspectives. But I need to evaluate if the author's position is valid or if they're wrong.\n\nThe problem here is the definition of \"accidental\" versus \"situational.\" The author is using a strict definition where any sexual activity is a choice, hence not accidental. The SO is using a more flexible definition where the outcome is unintended, even if there were actions leading to it. The author's argument might be seen as oversimplifying the complexities of human behavior. For example, someone might not plan to sleep with someone but could end up in a situation where it happens due to alcohol, emotional vulnerability, or other factors. \n\nHowever, the author's point is that the person in the situation made choices that led to the encounter, so it's not truly accidental. The SO is arguing that the intent wasn't there, so it's an accident. This is a philosophical debate about intent versus outcome. The author might be in the wrong if they dismiss their partner's perspective without understanding the nuances. Relationships require empathy and consideration for different viewpoints, so being rigid here could be problematic.\n\nThe author's reaction was also more intense than necessary, leading to the argument. Their defensive response might have been inappropriate. If the author dismissed their partner's feelings and didn't listen, that's a problem. The SO's analogy might be flawed (accidental murder vs. accidental sex), but the author's dismissal without discussion could be seen as the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not being open to another perspective and for reacting too strongly. Even if the author's logic is sound, how they presented it and reacted could harm the relationship. So the answer would be A.\n"
