      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author and their SO were discussing cheating in general. The author argued that sleeping with someone isn't an accident but a deliberate choice, even if circumstances change. Their SO disagreed, saying it can be accidental, like accidental murder. The SO felt offended and compared it to a situation where someone might be seduced and not mean to sleep with someone. The argument escalated, and the SO accused the author of cheating when they got defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider definitions. The author is saying that any sexual encounter requires conscious decision-making, so there's no such thing as an accident. The SO is countering that some situations can lead to it without intention, similar to accidental murder. The key here is whether \"accidental\" applies to consensual sex. \n\nLegally, sexual acts require consent, which implies some level of intent. But people might use \"accidental\" in a different way, maybe meaning that the situation led them to it without planning. However, even in those cases, there's intentional behavior, just perhaps not premeditated. So the author's point is that there's no real accident involved because both parties are making choices in the moment. \n\nThe SO's example of accidental murder is a bit of a stretch. Murder requires intent, even if it's not premeditated. But the comparison might be to show that some actions can be unintended in context. However, consensual sex isn't like a crime; it's a mutual decision. So the author's stance makes sense from a logical standpoint.\n\nBut the problem here is the argument style. The author might have dismissed their partner's viewpoint too harshly, leading to an argument. Even if the author is factually correct, the way the argument played out might be where the issue is. The SO felt accused of being naive, which could hurt their feelings. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because the argument was handled poorly, even if the original point had merit. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in general, not just the argument escalation. \n\nSo, the author's initial statement might be factually correct, but the way they presented it could have been insensitive. The SO's example of seduction might be a scenario where someone feels they were led into it against their will, but if it's consensual, it's still a choice. However, if the SO felt pressured or manipulated, that's a different context, which the author didn't address. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer depends on whether the author was wrong in their assertion. If the author's statement is technically correct but the delivery was poor, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is ignoring the possibility of non-consensual or coerced situations, that's a problem. But the original discussion was about cheating in general, not non-consensual acts. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's point is logical, but their handling of the argument led to conflict. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the initial statement. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the statement itself has merit, even if the argument was handled poorly. However, if the SO's point about \"situational\" cheating is valid in certain contexts, like emotional manipulation leading to unintended consequences, then maybe the author oversimplified. But consensual sex inherently involves intent, so the author's stance is defensible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for the statement itself, but the argument escalation is a separate issue.\n"
