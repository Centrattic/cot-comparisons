They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person (the author) in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a disagreement with their significant other (SO) regarding whether sleeping with someone can be an accident.\n\nThe author's main point is that you can't accidentally sleep with someone. They argue that it's always intentional, involving rational thought and a lack of respect. Their SO, on the other hand, believes that under certain circumstances, it can be accidental, even comparing it to accidental murder. The argument escalated, with the author getting defensive and their SO accusing them of being naive and even cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of both sides. The author's stance is that any sexual activity is a conscious decision, and thus not accidental. The SO argues that circumstances can lead someone to sleep with someone else unintentionally. \n\nIn real life, people often use terms like \"it just happened\" or \"we were caught up in the moment\" when discussing unplanned sexual encounters. However, legally and ethically, most societies consider sexual activity to require consent and active participation, which implies intentionality. The concept of \"accidental\" in this context might be more about justifying the action rather than the literal lack of intent. \n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is problematic because murder requires intent, whereas the SO is trying to equate a lack of prior planning with complete lack of intent. This analogy might be flawed because even if not premeditated, the act itself involves active participation at the moment.\n\nThe author's reaction might have been overly defensive and harsh, contributing to the argument. However, their initial statement about not being accidental isn't necessarily wrong. The SO's frustration might stem from feeling that the author doesn't understand or invalidate their perspective. \n\nCommunication issues seem to be at the core here. The author might not have considered that their SO is using \"accidental\" as a metaphor for situations where people make poor decisions under the influence of circumstances, rather than literally meaning it was an accident. Misunderstandings in communication can lead to conflicts like this.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't factually incorrect in stating that sleeping with someone isn't an accident. However, they might be missing the nuance in their SO's point. The SO might be referring to situations where people didn't plan for it but still made a choice in the moment. The author's rigidity in their stance might have caused them to dismiss the SO's viewpoint, leading to the argument. \n\nBut considering the author's argument is based on the idea that such actions are intentional, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The SO might be using the term \"accidental\" in a different way. However, the author's response escalated the situation, which could be seen as their fault for not handling the conversation calmly. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's initial assertion is factually correct (which it is) and whether their reaction was appropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the initial statement, then the author isn't wrong. But if the argument is about how they handled the conversation, then they might have been wrong in their reaction. The user's question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong for the situation described, so the main focus is on the initial statement and the subsequent argument.\n"
