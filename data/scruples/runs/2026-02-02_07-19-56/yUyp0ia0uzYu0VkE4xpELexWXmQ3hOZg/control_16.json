They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation involves a disagreement with their SO about whether cheating can be accidental. The author argues that sleeping with someone isn't an accident and requires intention, while the SO compares it to accidental murder and claims it's due to the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. The author says that \"accidentally\" sleeping with someone isn't possible because it requires conscious decision-making. The SO thinks that under certain circumstances, like being in a situation where things escalate, it can happen without intent. The comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, but maybe the SO is trying to say that even if you don't intend to, the situation can lead to actions you didn't plan.\n\nThe author's stance is that any sexual activity is a choice, so it's not accidental. The SO's argument is that sometimes people might not foresee the consequences of their actions in the moment. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's position is a matter of opinion. They have a right to their view, but the way they expressed it\u2014calling it \"disgusting\" and saying there's no \"situational\" cheating\u2014might have been confrontational. The SO felt offended, so the author's tone and words might have contributed to the conflict. However, the core belief that intent matters isn't inherently wrong. It's more about how the discussion was handled. The author's SO might be taking a different perspective, but neither view is objectively right or wrong. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding their opinion, but maybe they could have approached the conversation more compassionately. Since the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" considering the context and the SO's feelings, it's a judgment call. However, the author's opinion isn't factually incorrect, just a different perspective. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. The user's actions (rioting back) might indicate they escalated the conflict, but the original statement's validity is separate. The answer hinges on whether the belief itself is wrong. Since the belief isn't factually wrong, even if the expression was harsh, the answer is B.\n"
