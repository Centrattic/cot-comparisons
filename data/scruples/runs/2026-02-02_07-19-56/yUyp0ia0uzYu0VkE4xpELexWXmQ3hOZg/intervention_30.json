They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nFirst, the author argues that sleeping with someone isn't accidental because it requires conscious decisions. Their partner disagrees, using the analogy of accidental murder and suggesting that situations can lead to unintended outcomes.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that cheating is a deliberate act, which makes sense because consent and intentionality matter. However, the partner's perspective is that certain situations can create pressure or opportunities that lead to unintended actions, hence an \"accident.\" \n\nBut is cheating really accidental? In real life, even if someone claims they didn't plan it, the act still requires consent and active participation. The term \"accidental\" usually implies a lack of intent, which might not apply here. The partner's comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder typically requires intent, whereas the scenario here is different. \n\nThe author's reaction escalated the argument, which might have been a mistake in communication. However, the core belief about the nature of cheating isn't necessarily wrong. The problem might be more about the partner's justification using a weak analogy and the author's defensive response leading to conflict.\n\nSo, considering that the author's initial statement has some validity but the way they handled the argument might have been harsh, but the main issue is whether the author's viewpoint is wrong. I think the author is not in the wrong because the act of sleeping with someone does involve conscious decisions, making it intentional. The partner's argument seems like a stretch. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
