They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their stance on accidental cheating.\n\nThe situation is that the author and their significant other had a discussion about cheating. The author argues that sleeping with someone can't be accidental; it's always intentional or due to changed circumstances but not a true accident. The SO disagrees, comparing it to accidental murder, saying that if someone is in a situation, they might do it without intending to. The author got defensive and the SO accused them of cheating, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that any sexual encounter is a conscious choice, even if the circumstances change. The SO believes that in certain situations, people might end up sleeping together without intending to, hence \"accidental.\" \n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental.\" In most contexts, an accident implies that the outcome wasn't intended and happened without conscious decision. However, when it comes to sexual activity, many might argue that it requires active participation, making it hard to call it an accident. The SO's analogy to accidental murder is extreme because murder requires intent, but the author's point is that even if the situation leads someone to act, it's still a conscious decision.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they dismissed their SO's perspective too harshly, leading to the argument. However, if the SO is using the term \"accidental\" in a way that the author finds misleading, their reaction might be justified. The fact that the author rioted back harder than necessary suggests they might have overreacted, contributing to the conflict. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author's stance is wrong. If the author is correct that consent and intent are required, then there's no such thing as an accidental sexual encounter. However, some might argue that in very drunk or altered states, people might not be in control of their decisions, leading to situations they didn't intend. But that's more about impaired judgment rather than the act being accidental.\n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder is an act requiring intent, whereas the author's point is that even in situations, the person chooses to engage. The author's reaction might have been too harsh, but their initial stance isn't necessarily wrong. The problem might be the communication breakdown rather than the validity of the author's position.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
