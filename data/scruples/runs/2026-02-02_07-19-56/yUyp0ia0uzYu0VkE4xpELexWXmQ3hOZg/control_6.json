      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author and their significant other (SO) were discussing cheating in general, not directed at each other. The author made a strong statement that you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. They argue that any such encounter is intentional, with full rational thought, and that calling it an accident is disrespectful. The SO took offense, comparing it to accidental murder, and insisted that being in a certain situation can lead to it being accidental. The author then reacted strongly, leading to the SO accusing them of cheating defensively. Now, they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's statement is valid. The concept of \"accidental\" cheating might depend on how each person defines it. Some people might think that being in a situation (like too much alcohol, pressure, or emotional vulnerability) can lead to actions they didn't intend, hence calling it situational or accidental. The author, however, believes that every time you sleep with someone outside the relationship, it's a deliberate choice, no matter the circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong to hold that view. The author's argument is that even if the situation changes, the decision to sleep with someone is still a conscious act. The SO's counterargument is that intent isn't always clear, and sometimes people don't mean to cross that line but do so because of the situation. Comparing it to accidental murder is a strong analogy, but it's meant to highlight the seriousness of the action versus the intent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for stating their opinion. The author wasn't making a personal attack but expressing their belief about the nature of cheating. However, the SO felt deeply offended, which could mean the author's phrasing was too harsh or dismissive of their perspective. The author used words like \"disgusting\" and \"no respect,\" which might have come off as judgmental. Even if they meant to discuss the concept, the way it was phrased could invalidate the SO's feelings or experiences.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to rioting back much harder than necessary, which suggests they escalated the conflict. The SO's accusation of cheating during the argument might be a result of the heated exchange rather than a justified claim. The author's firm stance, combined with a defensive reaction, likely contributed to the argument. \n\nIn relationships, differing views on such topics are common, and it's important to approach them with empathy. The author's absolute statement that there's no such thing as accidental cheating might not allow room for the SO's perspective. While the author's viewpoint has merit\u2014it's hard to argue that actions aren't intentional to some degree\u2014the way it was communicated and the subsequent escalation could be where the mistake lies. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the opinion is valid, the manner in which it was expressed and the argumentative response were problematic. The SO's feelings are valid, and the author's approach might have been too rigid and dismissive, leading to unnecessary conflict.\n"
