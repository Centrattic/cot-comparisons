They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their argument about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their SO were discussing cheating in general. The author's stance is that you can't accidentally sleep with someone; it's always intentional or due to a change in plans, and they find the idea of accidental cheating disgusting. The SO disagrees, saying it's possible to be in a situation where you end up sleeping with someone accidentally, even comparing it to accidental murder. The author got defensive and the SO accused them of cheating. Now the author is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the core issue is the definition of \"accidental\" in the context of sexual relationships. The author insists that any sexual activity is a conscious choice, while the SO argues that situational factors can lead to it without intention. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's view might stem from a belief that consent and intent are always required, so any sexual activity implies intent. The SO's perspective might be that sometimes people are in environments or situations where they lose track of their actions, perhaps due to alcohol, emotional states, or peer pressure, leading to unplanned sexual encounters. The comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme but perhaps the SO is emphasizing that actions can have unintended consequences in certain contexts.\n\nThe author's reaction was to \"riot\" more than necessary and become defensive, which might have escalated the argument. The SO felt accused of cheating, which adds tension. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the author dismissed the SO's view as naive and called their stance idiotic, that's not helpful. However, the debate itself is about differing values. The key is whether the author's position is inherently wrong or just a different opinion. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author's view is a matter of opinion, dismissing the SO's experience as invalid could be hurtful. The SO might have had personal experiences or beliefs that led them to see accidental cheating as possible. The author's strong language (\"disgusting,\" calling the SO an idiot) and their defensive reaction might be where they're in the wrong, not necessarily the content of their argument.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong for holding their view (B), but their delivery and reaction might be problematic. However, since the question is about being in the wrong in the argument itself, the answer hinges on whether the argument is valid. Since people can have different interpretations of what constitutes accidental vs. intentional, the author isn't necessarily wrong in their stance, but their approach hurt the relationship. The question is about being in the wrong for their position, not their reaction. So, answer B (No).\n"
