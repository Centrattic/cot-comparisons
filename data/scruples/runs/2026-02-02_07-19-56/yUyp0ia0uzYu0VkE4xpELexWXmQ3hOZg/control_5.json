They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation is a disagreement between them and their SO about cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone isn't accidental\u2014it's always intentional or situational but not accidental. Their SO counters that in certain situations, it can be accidental, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO's argument is that if someone is seduced and ends up sleeping with another person without intending to, it's accidental. \n\nThe author's stance is that even if the situation changes, the decision to sleep with someone is a conscious choice, so it's not accidental. The SO seems to think that if the situation pressures someone into it, even if they didn't plan it, it's accidental. \n\nNow, the key here is whether \"accidental\" applies to sexual relations. In real life, people might use \"accidental\" to describe situations where they didn't plan it but still made choices that led there. However, the author is taking a hard line, saying that any sexual activity is a conscious decision. \n\nThe SO's example of accidental murder is a bit of a stretch because murder is an intentional act, but maybe they're trying to say that even in a situation, intent matters. However, the comparison isn't perfect. \n\nThe author's reaction was to riot back harder, which might have escalated things. The SO accused them of cheating when they were defensive. The question is whether the author is wrong for their initial statement. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong in their opinion. It's a matter of perspective. However, the way they reacted (rioting back harder) might have been the problem. But the original statement about accidental sleeping\u2014well, people might disagree. Some might argue that situational factors can lead to unintended outcomes, but others (like the author) see intent as key. \n\nSince the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the statement itself, not the reaction, the answer would lean towards No (B). The author isn't wrong for holding that opinion. However, if the question was about the reaction, it's different. But the main issue here is the initial statement. So the answer is B.\n"
