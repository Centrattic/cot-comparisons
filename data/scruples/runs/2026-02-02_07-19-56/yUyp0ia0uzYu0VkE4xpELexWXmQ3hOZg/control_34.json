They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after a disagreement with their significant other (SO) about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nThe author's main argument is that sleeping with someone can't be an accident because it requires conscious decisions and intent. They contrast this with their SO's view that in certain situations, you can end up sleeping with someone without intending to, similar to accidental murder. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's stance is that any sexual activity is a result of active choices, not accidents. They see it as a matter of intent and responsibility. The SO, on the other hand, argues that situational factors can lead to unintended consequences, like how someone might accidentally cause harm in a specific scenario. They use the analogy of accidental murder to suggest that intent isn't the only factor.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's position is valid. The author is emphasizing intentionality and responsibility. They might be making a moral judgment, suggesting that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, regardless of the circumstances. This perspective can be seen as holding people accountable for their actions, which is a common ethical stance.\n\nThe SO's argument is about situational factors leading to unintended outcomes. They might be pointing out that sometimes people can be in situations that push them towards actions they didn't initially plan. The analogy to accidental murder is a bit extreme, but it's meant to illustrate that not all harmful actions require premeditation.\n\nIs the author wrong for holding this view? The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. The author's statement that you can't accidentally sleep with someone is a subjective opinion, not an objective fact. However, the way they phrased it as a definitive statement (\"under no circumstances\") might come off as dismissive, which could have contributed to the SO's offense. \n\nThe SO took offense because the author's stance didn't acknowledge the possibility of situational factors. The author's use of words like \"naive\" and \"idiot\" when defending their position could have escalated the conflict. The author's reaction of \"rioting back, much harder than necessary\" and being accused of cheating when defensive suggests that the argument became personal and heated. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a different opinion, but their approach in the argument might have been problematic. They might have been too rigid in their stance without considering situational nuances, and their defensive response contributed to the conflict. However, the SO's analogy of accidental murder is a flawed comparison, which the author might have been right to challenge. \n\nUltimately, the core issue is about differing views on intent and responsibility. The author isn't factually wrong in their belief that intent is required, but how they expressed it and reacted to the disagreement might be where they're at fault. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong for their opinion, but possibly in the way they handled the discussion.\n"
