They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break this down.\n\nThe situation is a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author argues that it's always intentional, a conscious choice, and that calling it an accident is naive. The SO disagrees, using the analogy of accidental murder and claims that situational factors can lead to it happening without intent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. An \"accident\" typically refers to something that happens without intention. But when it comes to human behavior, especially something like sexual activity, intentionality is a big factor. The author's point is that once people engage in such an activity, it's a deliberate choice, even if circumstances changed. The SO is suggesting that under certain pressures or situations, it might happen without prior intent, hence \"accidental.\"\n\nBut is there such a thing as an accidental sexual encounter? Let's think. If two people are in a situation where they end up sleeping together, say after a lot of alcohol, maybe one person didn't intend to have sex but the situation escalated. The person might later say they didn't mean for it to happen. But legally and ethically, consent and intention matter. If both parties consented, even if it was impulsive, it's not an accident. However, if one person was incapacitated, it's not consensual and could be considered assault, which is intentional in a legal sense.\n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is a bit of a stretch. Murder is an intentional act, and even if someone didn't mean to kill, if they caused the death, it's still a crime. There's no such thing as accidental murder in most legal systems. So using that analogy might be a flawed argument here. The author is right to question that comparison.\n\nThe author's main issue is with the idea that sleeping with someone can be accidental. They see it as a lack of respect and a conscious choice. The SO is defending the possibility of situational factors leading to it without intent. The author's strong reaction might be because they view the situation as always involving intent, while the SO is emphasizing external pressures.\n\nNow, the SO took offense and then the author reacted strongly, leading to accusations of cheating. The author might have overreacted, but the core of the disagreement is about the definition of \"accidental\" in this context. The author isn't necessarily wrong in their stance, but the way they expressed it might have been harsh. The key is whether the author's position is valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for believing that consensual sexual activity requires intent. However, the SO's argument that situational factors can lead to it might have some merit in terms of how people perceive their own actions. For example, someone might not have planned to sleep with someone but in the heat of the moment, they did. However, that's still a choice, even if it's impulsive. So the author's point about it being a conscious decision is valid. The comparison to accidental murder is a weak analogy, which the author rightly pointed out.\n\nThe SO's reaction seems overly defensive, and the author's response was probably too harsh as well. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main argument isn't incorrect, but the way they handled the conversation might have contributed to the conflict. However, the core belief that you can't accidentally sleep with someone is defensible. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
