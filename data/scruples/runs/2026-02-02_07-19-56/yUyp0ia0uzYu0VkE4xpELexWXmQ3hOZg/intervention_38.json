They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and their SO regarding whether it's possible to \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The author argues that it's not accidental and requires intent, while the SO insists that under certain situations, it can happen without intention, even comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's point is that any sexual encounter requires conscious decision-making, so calling it an accident is invalid. The SO's counter is that situational factors can lead someone to sleep with another person unintentionally. The comparison to accidental murder is a strong one, implying that the SO thinks intent isn't necessary.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether \"accidental\" sexual relations can exist. The author's stance is that intent is always present, making it not accidental. The SO's stance is that sometimes the context leads to it without prior intent. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The SO took offense, which suggests that the author's statement might have been perceived as dismissive or not acknowledging the complexity of situations. The author's language, like calling it \"disgusting\" and lacking respect, might have been harsh, contributing to the SO feeling attacked. \n\nAlso, the author's response when the SO disagreed was to \"riot back harder,\" which could indicate a lack of empathy. The SO's point about situational factors is a valid perspective in relationships discussions. Some people might argue that pressure from circumstances (like being in a certain environment, peer influence, or alcohol) can lead to unintended actions. \n\nThe author's use of absolute terms (\"under no circumstances\") might be too rigid, not allowing for the gray areas that exist in real-life situations. This could be why the SO felt the author was being naive. The author's reaction and the harsh language likely escalated the conflict, which is a common sign of being in the wrong in such disputes. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's argument isn't without merit. There's a difference between intent and opportunity. However, the way the author expressed their view and the refusal to acknowledge any scenario where it's accidental could be problematic. The SO's comparison to accidental murder, while extreme, highlights the author's dismissal of the possibility that someone might not fully realize the consequences of their actions.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author's approach might have been confrontational rather than open to discussion. The SO's offense is valid if they felt the author was invalidating their experiences or perspective. The author's subsequent defensive and aggressive reaction exacerbated the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's wrongdoing likely stems from how they presented their argument and reacted to dissent, rather than the argument's content itself. The harsh language and unwillingness to consider other viewpoints are key factors here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
