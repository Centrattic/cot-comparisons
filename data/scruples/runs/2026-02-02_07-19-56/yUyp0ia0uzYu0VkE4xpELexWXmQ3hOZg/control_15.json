They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The scenario is about a conversation between the author and their significant other (SO) regarding cheating. The author argues that sleeping with someone is always intentional, not accidental, and called it disgusting. The SO was offended, compared it to accidental murder, and claimed situations can lead to accidental sleeping. The author got defensive and was accused of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's stance is that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, so there's no such thing as an \"accident.\" The SO, on the other hand, believes that under certain circumstances, people might find themselves in a situation where they end up sleeping with someone without intending to. The SO used the analogy of accidental murder, which is extreme, but maybe they meant that while the outcome is unintended, the actions leading up to it weren't. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is wrong for their position. The author's argument is that there's no such thing as accidental sleep with someone because it requires conscious decisions. The SO is disagreeing, thinking that \"situational\" factors can lead to it. \n\nI need to consider the nuances. In real life, people might argue that sometimes people end up in situations where they didn't plan to have sex but did so because of the circumstances (like being drunk, in a vulnerable position, or emotional pressure). However, the author seems to take a strict view that any sexual activity is a choice, even if influenced by the situation. \n\nThe author's response called the act \"disgusting\" and lacked respect, which might have been offensive to the SO. The SO felt that their argument was valid, and the author dismissed it, leading to an argument. The author's defensiveness and the SO's accusation of cheating might have escalated the situation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author might not be factually incorrect in saying that you can't accidentally sleep with someone if you define it as a conscious decision. However, the way they expressed their opinion was judgmental and disrespectful, which could have been hurtful. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is a stretch, but the author's response of rioting and being defensive is also problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's stance might be based on a personal belief or moral view, which is okay, but how they communicated it and reacted to the SO's disagreement might have been the issue. The SO felt disrespected, and the author's reaction was too harsh. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for the way they handled the conversation, even if their initial point isn't entirely wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the author's position is that it's not accidental, that's a matter of opinion. However, the way they expressed it and the escalation of the argument might make them at fault. The SO's analogy is flawed (accidental murder is a legal term, but accidental sleep is not), but the author's reaction was excessive. So, considering the communication and the resulting conflict, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if their initial point isn't factually incorrect.\n"
