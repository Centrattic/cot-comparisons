They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation is a disagreement with their partner about whether cheating can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author believes that sleeping with someone else is a deliberate act, not an accident. They think it requires intent and rational thought, and that calling it accidental is wrong. The partner, on the other hand, argues that situations can arise where you end up sleeping with someone unintentionally, even comparing it to accidental murder. They think the author is naive for not seeing that.\n\nSo, the key question is: Can cheating be considered accidental? The author says no, the partner says yes. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider definitions. What does \"accidental\" mean in this context? Typically, an accident implies lack of intent. If someone didn't mean to do something, but it happened due to circumstances, is that an accident? For example, if two people are drunk and end up in bed, maybe they didn't plan to have sex. But is that truly accidental? Some might argue that even in that case, there was some level of decision-making, even if it's impaired. Others might see it as a result of the situation rather than a premeditated act.\n\nThe author's argument hinges on the idea that there's no such thing as accidental cheating because it always involves some choice, even if it's not pre-planned. The partner's counter is that certain situations can lead to it without intention. The comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, but it's meant to emphasize that outcomes can occur without direct intent.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's stance is invalid. The author is making a strong statement that accidental sleeping is impossible. The partner's examples suggest that in some contexts, people might not have intended to sleep with someone but end up doing so. The author's reaction was defensive and heated, which might indicate they were too rigid in their position. The partner's comparison to accidental murder might not be a perfect analogy, but it's their way of illustrating the point.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I should consider if the author's dismissal of the partner's perspective is unreasonable. By calling the partner's view naive and an idiot, the author may have been dismissive without understanding the nuances. However, the author's initial statement is a strong claim that might not account for all possible scenarios.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't consider the partner's viewpoint and reacted harshly, that could be problematic. But if the partner was making a point that's not commonly accepted, the author might have a valid stance. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's mistake might be in the way they presented their argument, not necessarily the argument itself. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author was rigid in their position and the partner felt disrespected, the author might be at fault for not acknowledging possible exceptions and responding in a way that escalated the conflict. So, leaning towards answer A.\n"
