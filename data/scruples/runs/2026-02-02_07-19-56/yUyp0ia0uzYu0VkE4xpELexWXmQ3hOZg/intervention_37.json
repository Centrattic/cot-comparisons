They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nFirst, the author argues that sleeping with someone can't be an accident because it requires intentional actions and decisions, like going out with the intention or changing plans mid-way. They see it as a conscious choice and find the idea of it being accidental as disrespectful or even naive. The SO, on the other hand, believes that situations can escalate in a way that makes it accidental, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO's example includes seduction, being in a certain place, and then the act happening without planning, hence \"accidental\" in their view.\n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental\" in the context of sexual relationships. The author thinks that any sexual encounter requires intent, so calling it an accident is invalid. The SO thinks that under certain circumstances, the situation might lead to it without the person's full intention. \n\nI need to consider cultural or moral perspectives. Some people might believe that consent and intent are necessary for any sexual act, so the idea of an accidental encounter might not hold up if the person had even a small amount of consent or participation. Others might argue that in situations where alcohol is involved or when emotions are high, people can make decisions they don't fully intend, thus considering it accidental. \n\nAlso, the comparison to accidental murder is a strong metaphor. Murder is an intentional act, so if someone says a sexual act can be accidental like murder, that's a stretch. But maybe the SO is trying to say that sometimes people end up in situations where they don't plan for it to happen, even if they are involved in the steps leading up to it. \n\nThe author's reaction might have been too harsh. By calling the SO's view \"disgusting\" and being defensive, they might have escalated the argument. The SO's offense could stem from feeling that their perspective isn't being respected. The author's absolute stance that it can't be accidental might not account for nuances in different situations, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, if the author dismissed their SO's perspective without considering possible scenarios where someone might feel it's accidental, they could be in the wrong. However, if the author is correct that any sexual act requires intent, then the SO's argument might be flawed. \n\nBut in relationship dynamics, it's not just about being right or wrong factually, but also about communication and respect. The author's approach might have been too confrontational, leading to the SO feeling attacked. Even if the author's logic is sound, the way they presented it might have been hurtful. \n\nTherefore, the author could be in the wrong for not acknowledging the complexity of the situation and for reacting with defensiveness. The SO's viewpoint might be based on different experiences or interpretations of what constitutes intent, and dismissing that could be the root of the conflict. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
