They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their stance on accidental sleep with someone. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their SO about whether sleeping with someone can be accidental, similar to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that sleeping with someone isn't accidental and requires conscious decisions. The SO counters with examples where it could happen due to the situation, not intent. The author then compares it to murder, which the SO finds offensive.\n\nI should consider the nuances here. The term \"accidental\" typically implies unintentional actions. However, in the context of sexual encounters, intent is often debated. The author's position is that each step towards a sexual act is a conscious choice, making it impossible to be accidental. The SO uses the example of being seduced and the situation escalating, where maybe the person didn't initially intend to sleep with someone but ended up doing so due to circumstances.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's argument is valid. If every action leading to sex is intentional, then the author is correct. But if someone is in a situation where they lose control or make poor decisions under influence, perhaps they might consider it accidental. However, legal and ethical perspectives usually require intent for an action to be considered consensual. The comparison to accidental murder is problematic because murder requires intent, and even if someone causes death unintentionally (like a car accident), it's not the same as a consensual act.\n\nThe author's response was defensive, leading to accusations from the SO. The SO's example seems to suggest that intent isn't present, but in reality, each step towards the act involves choices. So the author's point that it's a deliberate process has merit. However, the author's insistence on calling it non-accidental might not account for scenarios where someone might feel pressured or manipulated into the situation without fully realizing the consequences, which could be seen as situational factors.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author is wrong for their stance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding that opinion, but their argument's validity depends on the definition of \"accidental.\" If the author is rigidly denying any possibility of situational influences, that could be problematic. However, if they are emphasizing that each decision is intentional, they have a point legally and ethically, where consent and intent matter. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is flawed because murder and consensual sex are different in terms of intent and impact. So the author's argument isn't entirely wrong, but their tone and the SO's reaction might have escalated the situation. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their stance has logical and ethical basis, even if the discussion could have been handled more calmly.\n"
