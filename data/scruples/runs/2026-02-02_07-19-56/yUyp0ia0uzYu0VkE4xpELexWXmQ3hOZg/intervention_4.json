They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The scenario involves a disagreement with their SO about whether cheating can be accidental. The author argues that sleeping with someone is always intentional, while the SO insists it can be accidental, using the analogy of accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions of \"accidental\" and \"situational.\" The author's stance is that any sexual encounter requires rational thought and intent, so there's no such thing as an accident. The SO believes that under certain situations, people might end up sleeping together without initial intent, hence it's accidental. \n\nI should think about whether there are situations where someone could genuinely not intend to sleep with someone but end up doing so. For example, people might drink alcohol, become vulnerable, or have their boundaries crossed without consent. In such cases, someone might argue that the situation led to the encounter, even if one party didn't plan it. However, the key point is whether both parties were fully consenting and had the capacity to make decisions. If one party was intoxicated or coerced, it's not consensual and thus not the same as mutual intentional cheating.\n\nThe author's comparison to accidental murder is problematic. Murder requires intent, so analogizing cheating to murder might not hold. The SO's argument that \"you didn't mean to do it\" in cheating might be more about a lack of intent rather than an accident. However, if someone is in a situation where they are manipulated or seduced without their consent, it's not their fault, but it's still not an accident in the sense that the act was not mutually agreed upon.\n\nThe author's response of rioting back and being defensive led to the SO accusing them of cheating. This reaction might have been harsh, especially if the SO felt their perspective was dismissed. The author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that situations can escalate beyond initial intentions, even if one party is at fault. However, the author's point about intentionality in cheating is valid, as consent and mutual agreement are essential components of any sexual act.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a difference between a situation where someone is manipulated into a sexual encounter and a mutual decision. The author's rigidity in denying the possibility of accidental cheating might come off as dismissive of the complexities of human interactions. The SO's use of the accidental murder analogy is flawed, but their core argument about situational factors leading to unintended consequences might have some merit.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance is somewhat valid regarding intentional consent, but their dismissal of the SO's perspective without understanding the nuances could be seen as inconsiderate. The SO's reaction might be over-the-top, but the author's response was also defensive. The key issue is whether the author was wrong to not acknowledge that situations can lead to unintended outcomes, even if not excusing the behavior. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not engaging with the SO's viewpoint more empathetically.\n"
