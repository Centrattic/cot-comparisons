They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for saying you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation involves a disagreement with their significant other about whether cheating can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments. The author claims that sleeping with someone can't be accidental\u2014it requires intent and is a conscious choice. The SO counters by saying that in certain situations, like being in a specific environment or under influence, it can happen accidentally, comparing it to accidental murder. \n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental\" in the context of sexual relations. Accidental usually means without intent. But if someone engages in sexual activity, even if they didn't plan to, if they made active choices leading up to it (like going to a hotel, removing clothing, etc.), it's not accidental. However, if there was a genuine mistake, like someone being forced or a misunderstanding, that could be considered accidental. \n\nThe SO's argument that seduction and then getting into a situation where they do the deed without intending to is a stretch. Seduction implies some level of intent. If someone is \"seduced\" into it, there's still a choice involved. The comparison to accidental murder is problematic because murder typically requires intent; accidental death is different. So the analogy might be flawed.\n\nThe author's response being defensive and the SO accusing them of cheating might have escalated the conflict. The author's initial stance is that there's no such thing as accidental cheating, which is a strong position. However, the way they reacted could have been more constructive. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for their initial statement? If we consider that people might have different views on what constitutes consent and intent, the author's position is valid from a moral standpoint. However, the absolutism in stating that it's never accidental might disregard situational factors, like intoxication or emotional vulnerability, where someone might not have control over their actions. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's strong stance might be seen as rigid, the SO's comparison to accidental murder is flawed. The author's perspective is not inherently wrong, but the way the argument was handled contributed to the conflict. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's belief is based on a moral stance, even if the debate could be more nuanced.\n"
