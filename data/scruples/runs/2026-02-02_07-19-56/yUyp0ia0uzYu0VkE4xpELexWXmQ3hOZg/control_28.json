      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying that you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation is that they had a discussion with their SO about cheating, and the author made a strong statement that sleeping with someone isn't accidental, while the SO argued it can be, comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's position is that any sexual encounter is a deliberate choice, not an accident. They called it \"disgusting\" and insisted there's full rational thought involved. The SO, on the other hand, believes that under certain situations, it can happen without intent, even if you end up sleeping with someone. The SO used the example of seduction leading to it, and called the author naive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The key points to consider are the definition of \"accidental\" in the context of sexual encounters. The author argues that it's always intentional, while the SO thinks situational factors can lead to it without intent. \n\nI should think about the nuances here. In real life, people might claim they \"just ended up\" in a situation where they had sex without intending to. For example, maybe after a few drinks, a casual meeting turns into something more. However, the author is taking a hardline stance that there's no such thing as an accident, which could be seen as dismissing the other person's perspective. \n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Well, the author's statement is a strong opinion. The SO's comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, but the author's insistence that there's no such thing as accidental cheating might not account for varying levels of consent and intentionality. The author's language was harsh (\"disgusting\", \"no respect\") which could have contributed to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the author might believe that any sexual activity requires conscious decisions, so calling it an accident is a way to justify it. The SO's argument that they didn't mean to do it might stem from feeling that situations can escalate beyond control. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's reaction led to a heated argument where they were defensive and the SO felt accused of cheating. The initial disagreement might have been a difference in opinions, but the way it was handled escalated things. The author's strong stance without considering situational factors could be problematic, but maybe they were just expressing their view. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's position is a valid opinion, but the way they expressed it (calling it disgusting, being inflexible) might have caused unnecessary conflict. However, the SO also took offense and compared it to accidental murder, which is a hyperbolic comparison. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's statement was an opinion or an absolute truth. Since they made it sound like a fact (\"under no circumstances...\"), that could be seen as dismissive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing for different perspectives. But maybe not entirely. It's a nuanced situation.\n"
