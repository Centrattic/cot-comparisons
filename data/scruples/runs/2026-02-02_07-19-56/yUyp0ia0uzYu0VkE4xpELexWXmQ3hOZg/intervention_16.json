They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The author and their SO had a disagreement about cheating. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone is a deliberate act, not an accident, and that there's no such thing as a \"situation\" leading to it without intent. The SO argued that in certain situations, you could end up sleeping with someone accidentally, comparing it to accidental murder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. \"Accidentally\" usually means without intent. But in the context of human behavior, especially intimate acts, the line between accident and intent can be blurry. The author is taking a moral stance, saying that any sexual activity is a choice made with rational thought, hence not accidental. The SO counters that situations can pressure or seduce someone into it without premeditation, even if they didn't plan to sleep with the person.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's position is valid. The author's argument is that intent is always present, making it impossible to \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The SO's argument is that sometimes, despite not intending to, the situation leads to the act. From a moral or philosophical standpoint, this is a classic debate about free will versus situational influence. \n\nIn ethics, some theories suggest that people can act in ways they didn't intend if the situation is strong enough, even if they didn't plan it. For example, someone might say they didn't plan to have sex but ended up doing so because they were drunk and it happened. However, others argue that even in such cases, there's a level of decision-making involved, even if impaired.\n\nLegally, the concept of \"accidental\" in crimes like murder is different. Murder requires intent, whereas other crimes might not. Comparing accidental murder to accidental sex isn't a perfect analogy. The SO's comparison might be flawed here because the legal definitions differ.\n\nThe author's response was defensive and led to a heated argument. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's position isn't necessarily incorrect from a moral standpoint, but the rigidity of their belief without considering situational factors could be seen as naive, as the SO pointed out. However, the author's assertion that it's always intentional isn't entirely without merit either.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have been too adamant, leading to the SO feeling attacked. The SO's reaction might be valid because they feel misunderstood. The author could have acknowledged that there are varying degrees of intent but still maintained their overall point. The fact that the author rioted harder than necessary suggests that their response was overly harsh, contributing to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's initial statement might be seen as an oversimplification, but it's a common debate. However, their reaction (rioting harder) and the inflexibility in the argument could make them at fault in the conflict. The SO's point about situational factors leading to unintended actions has validity, especially considering human behavior's complexity. Therefore, the author's rigid stance and defensive reaction might place them in the wrong.\n"
