They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for their stance on whether sleeping with someone can be accidental. The author and their SO had a disagreement during a conversation about cheating.\n\nThe author argues that sleeping with someone isn't accidental; it requires intent and rational thought, and they find the idea of an \"accidental\" encounter to be disrespectful. The SO, on the other hand, believes that certain situations can lead to accidental sleepovers, comparing it to accidental murder. The SO also claims that if someone is seduced, gets to a location, and ends up having sex without intending to, it's still accidental. The argument escalated, with the author defending their viewpoint more intensely and the SO accusing them of being naive and even of cheating when they became defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's position is that there's no such thing as an accidental sexual encounter because it requires conscious decisions at various stages\u2014like going on a date, being in a private setting, etc. The SO's counter is that once in a situation, the progression could be influenced by the moment, leading to unintended consequences. The analogy to murder is a bit extreme, but the SO's point is that the outcome isn't always under the person's control once the situation starts.\n\nNow, the key question here is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance. The author's argument is a moral or philosophical one, not an accusation against their SO. They were discussing the topic in general, not addressing their partner's behavior. However, the way the argument escalated might be a point of contention.\n\nThe SO took offense and compared it to accidental murder, which could be seen as an exaggeration. The author's reaction was also heated, which might have contributed to the conflict. The SO accused the author of being naive and even of cheating, which seems like a personal attack rather than a reasonable disagreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is more about differing viewpoints. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding their opinion, especially if the discussion was about general scenarios rather than a specific accusation. However, the way the argument was handled\u2014both in terms of the SO's comparison and the author's defensive response\u2014could be problematic.\n\nThe author might not be wrong in their belief, but their handling of the argument could be improved. The SO's reaction, while perhaps overly defensive, might stem from a different perspective on consent and situational factors. The author's insistence that there's no such thing as an accident could come off as dismissive of the complexities of human behavior and decision-making in the moment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for their viewpoint, but the situation shows that both parties could approach the discussion more calmly and respectfully. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong), but the main issue is the conflict escalation rather than the initial stance.\n"
