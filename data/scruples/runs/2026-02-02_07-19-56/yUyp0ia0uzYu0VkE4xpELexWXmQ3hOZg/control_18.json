They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for arguing that you can't accidentally sleep with someone. The situation is they had a discussion with their SO about cheating. The author's stance is that sleeping with someone is a deliberate act, not an accident, and that it's not situational. Their SO disagreed, saying that it can be accidental, like in a certain situation, and compared it to accidental murder. The SO even gave an example of seducing someone and ending up sleeping with them without intending to, calling it an accident.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether their assertion is wrong. The author argues that any sexual encounter is a conscious decision, not an accident. The SO thinks that even if you end up sleeping with someone, if you didn't mean to, it's accidental. \n\nThe key here is the definition of \"accidental\" in this context. The author's point is that even if the situation changes, the person makes a choice each step of the way\u2014agreeing to be with someone, progressing towards intimacy, etc. So, there's intent involved. The SO is using \"accidental\" more like a lack of intent, but the actual actions are deliberate. \n\nIn real-life discussions, people often use the term \"accidental\" to mean that they didn't plan to sleep with someone, but the situation led to it. However, the author is taking a strict stance that every action is a choice, hence no accident. The SO might be using \"accidental\" in a colloquial sense, but the author sees it as wrong because there's no such thing as an accidental sexual encounter\u2014it's a series of choices.\n\nIs the author wrong for that stance? If we take a strict moral or philosophical view, then yes, the author is correct that you can't accidentally sleep with someone because every step requires intentional actions. However, in everyday language, people might use \"accidental\" to mean unintended. So the author's position is more about semantics. \n\nBut the problem arises in the relationship. The SO felt offended and took the argument personally, which led to a conflict. The author might not be wrong in their reasoning, but their approach could have been harsh. The SO interpreted the argument as a personal attack or as the author being naive. The author's response was defensive and led to a bigger argument, which might be their fault. However, the initial stance about the impossibility of accidental sleeping with someone could be seen as a valid perspective, even if others disagree.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing that view. The answer hinges on whether their statement is factually incorrect or if it's a matter of differing opinions. Since both sides can have valid points, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The real issue is the way the disagreement was handled, leading to a conflict. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's more about the discussion approach. However, if the community thinks that the author is wrong, the answer would be A. But based on reasoning, the author's statement isn't factually wrong, just a matter of perspective. So Answer: B.\n"
