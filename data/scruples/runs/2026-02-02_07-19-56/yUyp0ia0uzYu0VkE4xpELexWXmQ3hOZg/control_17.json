They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying you can't \"accidentally\" sleep with someone. The context is a disagreement between the author and their significant other (SO) about whether cheating can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author argues that sleeping with someone else is always intentional, either planned or a result of changing situations, and that it's not accidental. The SO disagrees, giving an example of being in a situation where they \"didn't mean to do it\" but still ended up sleeping with someone, comparing it to accidental murder. The argument escalated, leading to the author being defensive and the SO accusing them of cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider perspectives. The author's stance is that any sexual activity with someone outside the relationship requires conscious decision-making, so it's not accidental. The SO, however, believes that under certain circumstances, people might lose control or be influenced by the moment, making it \"accidental.\" \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel that labeling cheating as accidental minimizes the intent and responsibility. On the other hand, the SO might argue that emotions, peer pressure, or situational factors can cloud judgment, leading to unintended actions. The comparison to accidental murder is extreme but highlights the SO's belief that intention isn't the only factor.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's statement could be seen as rigid, not acknowledging the complexity of human behavior. However, the SO's example of seduction and changing situations might be stretching the concept of \"accidental.\" The author's defensive reaction and the SO's accusation of cheating suggest a deeper issue in their communication style rather than just the topic of cheating.\n\nLegally and ethically, cheating typically involves intentional actions. But in real life, people might have varying views on what constitutes intent. The author's position might be more aligned with the idea that consent and choice are always involved, while the SO might be emphasizing external pressures. \n\nThe main issue here is not just about right or wrong but how they handle the disagreement. The author's response was overly reactive, which could be a mistake. However, the SO's comparison to murder is also hyperbolic. Both parties might have contributed to the conflict through their communication styles.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their initial statement, but their reaction was excessive. The core dispute is more about differing views on intent versus situation. So, the answer would likely be B (No), but with the caveat that both could improve their communication.\n"
