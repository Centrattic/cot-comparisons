They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement with their SO regarding whether sleeping with someone can be accidental.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author asserts that you can't accidentally sleep with someone; it's always intentional. The SO disagrees, saying that in certain situations, it can be accidental, even comparing it to accidental murder. The argument escalated, and the author is now being accused of cheating when they were defensive.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that sex requires conscious decision-making, so it's not accidental. The SO's view is that situational factors can lead to it happening without intent. \n\nLegally and morally, most societies consider consent and intent important. However, the term \"accidental\" here might be a metaphor for situations where people end up in compromising positions without planning. But the author is firm that intent is necessary, which is a valid ethical stance. \n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is a bit extreme, as murder can't be accidental in the same way if it's a physical act. However, the SO's argument is that under the influence or certain scenarios, someone might lose control and end up in a sexual situation without intending to. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author's statement was judgmental. The author called the act \"disgusting,\" which could be seen as dismissive of the SO's perspective. That might have contributed to the SO feeling offended. \n\nBut the author isn't wrong in stating that sexual activity is a conscious choice. However, the use of strong language and the way the argument escalated might have made the author come across as insensitive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for holding their opinion, but perhaps the way they expressed it and reacted to the SO's differing view was problematic. The SO's reaction might be due to feeling judged, but the author's firm stance isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but their approach could use improvement. However, depending on the interpretation of \"accidental,\" the author's position is logically sound. The SO's claim hinges on the idea that situations can lead to unintended outcomes, but the author rightly points out that sexual activity requires intent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
