They then compared it to accidental murder.\n\nThey claimed you could easy seduce a person, get somewhere, strip, do the deed, and would still class as 'accidental' or 'a result of the situation', because they 'didnt mean to do it'. Said I was naive and an idiot if I thought otherwise.\n\nI rioted back, admittedly, much harder than necessary, and they accused me of cheating (as I was being defensive). AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author and their SO were discussing cheating. The author argued that sleeping with someone can't be accidental\u2014it's always a conscious choice. The SO disagreed, using the analogy of accidental murder and claimed that situations can lead to it unintentionally. The argument escalated, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's stance is valid. The author's point is that sleeping with someone is a deliberate act, not accidental. From a moral or ethical standpoint, this seems reasonable because consent and intentionality are key in such actions. However, people might argue that in certain situations, like after a lot of drinking or under pressure, someone might not be fully aware of their actions. But the term \"accidental\" usually implies lack of intent. \n\nThe SO's comparison to accidental murder is interesting. Murder is typically a criminal act requiring intent, so calling it accidental might be a stretch. However, maybe the SO is using hyperbole to emphasize that some situations can lead to unintended outcomes. But if someone intentionally engages in activities that lead to sex, even if they claim it was an accident, that's a contradiction. \n\nThe author's reaction was defensive, leading to the SO accusing them of cheating. The author might have been too rigid in their stance, not considering nuances, which could have caused the SO to feel judged. But the core argument about intent in cheating is a valid point. \n\nIs the author wrong for stating their opinion? People have different views on consent and intention. The author might be in the right in their belief, but how they expressed it could have been better. The SO's reaction might stem from feeling that the author was dismissing their perspective. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's argument is based on intent, which is a key factor in defining cheating, they might not be wrong. The SO's analogy might be flawed, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The main issue might be how they handled the disagreement rather than the stance itself. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for debate on communication style. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not the handling of the argument. Since the author's core argument is reasonable, the answer is B.\n"
