It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking his fianc\u00e9e out, and planning to break up after finding out she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, the background: They both decided to lose weight for health reasons after his dad's heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but his fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating junk food. He confronted her, she got defensive, and now he's kicking her out and considering a breakup.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Mutual Agreement**: They both agreed on the health goals. If she didn't follow through, maybe she didn't commit, but he trusted her. However, she lied about her actions. Lies of omission or commission might be a problem.\n\n2. **Trust and Honesty**: Trust is crucial in a relationship. She lied about her gym attendance and eating habits. That's a breach of trust. He had a right to feel betrayed.\n\n3. **Control vs. Support**: The fianc\u00e9e claims he was controlling. He was cooking meals and monitoring her, but if it's for health reasons, is that controlling? Maybe she felt pressured. But they did agree on the goals. The line between support and control can be thin. If he was enforcing strict rules without her consent, that's an issue. However, they might have agreed on the plan together initially.\n\n4. **Reaction to Lies**: When he found out the truth, his reaction was to kick her out. Was that an overreaction? He was hurt and angry. Breaking up over lies might be justified if trust is broken beyond repair. However, maybe he should have tried to address the issue first, like couples counseling, instead of immediate breakup.\n\n5. **Communication**: He says he confronted her, and she got defensive. Maybe there was a lack of communication about why she wasn't following through. Perhaps he was too focused on his own goals and didn't consider her feelings or challenges.\n\n6. **Health Goals**: The fianc\u00e9e now says he's trying to change who he is. That might indicate she feels her identity is tied to her weight, which could be a deeper issue. However, he made changes for health reasons, which are valid.\n\n7. **Breaking Up**: The decision to break up is a big step. Is it fair because she lied about their mutual goal? If trust is broken, it's a valid reason. But maybe other options exist before ending the relationship.\n\nPossible angles: The author's right to be upset about the lies and the health risks. On the other hand, maybe he was too controlling in enforcing the plan, which led to her hiding the truth. The balance between supporting each other and respecting personal autonomy is key here.\n\nIn conclusion, the fianc\u00e9e lied about a significant mutual agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author's anger is understandable. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship dynamics. If the control was excessive from the start, that's an issue. But since they agreed on the goals, her lying could make him justified in his reaction. However, the immediate breakup might be a hasty decision; perhaps working through the issues would be better. But given the betrayal, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
