It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up because she lied about not going to the gym and not losing weight.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author and his fianc\u00e9e decided together to lose weight, which is a shared goal. The author worked hard, changed his diet, went to the gym daily, and even cooked for both. He lost 110 pounds. The fianc\u00e9e, however, didn't lose weight and actually gained. She told him she was going to the gym when she wasn't, ate out a lot, and hid junk food. The author found out through the gym owner that she was lying and then confronted her, leading to her being kicked out and plans to break up.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, they had a mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e broke that trust by lying. The author had every right to be upset because her actions were deceptive. The author isn't forcing her to lose weight; they agreed together. The fianc\u00e9e is now blaming the author for being controlling, but she was the one hiding the truth. The author's reaction, while intense, is a response to being lied to for a whole year. Breaking up because of dishonesty is common.\n\nBut wait, is the author being controlling? The fianc\u00e9e says the author forced her to lose weight. But they had agreed on the goal together. The author was cooking healthy meals, which is part of their shared plan. However, the author might have been overstepping by expecting her to follow his plan without her consent. But since they agreed, maybe not. The key issue here is the lies and deception from her side, not the author's control. The author's actions are a result of her betrayal.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one person lies about something as important as health goals that they both committed to, that's a big deal. The author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e's response of calling him controlling might be deflecting. The author isn't wrong for wanting to end the relationship because of her dishonesty. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
