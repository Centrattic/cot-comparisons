It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who lied about not losing weight, the author kicked her out and wants to break up. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author and his fianc\u00e9e set a goal to lose weight together for health reasons. The author lost a significant amount, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight and lied about her gym attendance and eating habits. The author found out she lied, confronted her, and now wants to break up.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid concern for their health, especially after his dad's heart attack. They both agreed to make changes. The fianc\u00e9e's lying about not going to the gym and eating unhealthy food is definitely deceitful. The author feels betrayed because they trusted each other. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was too controlling? Did they pressure the fianc\u00e9e into losing weight? The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Kicking someone out of the apartment they pay for is a big step. Also, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that the author was being overbearing, making her feel forced to diet, which could affect her mental health.\n\nBut the key here is that the fianc\u00e9e lied about something they both agreed was important. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If she broke that trust by lying, it's reasonable for the author to be upset. The author's actions are a reaction to being deceived about a significant life decision they both made. The fianc\u00e9e's defense that the author is controlling might have some truth if the author was pressuring her, but since the author also lost weight and they both agreed on the plan initially, maybe the pressure wasn't forced upon her. \n\nThe fact that she hid food and lied about her exercise routine shows a lack of honesty. The author has every right to be hurt and want to reassess the relationship. Breaking up is a personal choice, but the lying and deception are valid reasons. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their feelings and taking action after being misled. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
