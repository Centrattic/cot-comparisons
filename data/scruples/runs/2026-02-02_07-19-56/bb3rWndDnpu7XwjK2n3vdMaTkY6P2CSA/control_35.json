It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking his fianc\u00e9e out, and planning a breakup because she lied about her weight loss and gym attendance.\n\nFirst, the background: Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided in 2017 to lose weight after his dad's heart attack. They committed to changing their habits, and the author lost 110 pounds. However, his fianc\u00e9e didn't lose weight and actually gained 60 pounds. He found out she stopped going to the gym and was eating out, lying to him. She blamed him for being controlling. He kicked her out and is considering a breakup.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, she lied for a whole year. They had a mutual agreement to get healthier, and she broke that trust. Hiding food, lying about gym attendance, and eating out a lot\u2014those are significant deceptions. He had a right to be upset because they were in this together. The fact that she accused him of controlling her adds to the betrayal. He had invested a lot into their shared goal, cooking meals, changing their lives. Finding out she was lying after all that effort would be hurtful and justifiable reasons for anger.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he overreacted by kicking her out and planning to break up. Sometimes, relationships require communication and working through issues. However, the lies were about something they agreed on and were critical to their health. Trust is a big part of relationships, and lying about such a core commitment could be a deal-breaker. Also, she was defensive and didn't own up to her actions, which might justify his decision to end things.\n\nHe might also be in a position where he's paying for the apartment, so her staying there without contributing might be a factor. But the main issue is the trust and commitment to their shared goal. If she wasn't honest and broke their agreement, then he's not entirely in the wrong. She was also making accusations against him, which might have pushed him over the edge.\n\nBut wait, is it possible he was being too controlling? The fianc\u00e9e said he forced her to lose weight. Maybe she felt pressured and didn't want to change her habits but didn't communicate that. However, they both agreed to the goal initially. So it's a bit of a gray area. But the lies she committed were intentional and hurtful. Even if there was pressure, lying for a year is a serious breach of trust.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's reaction is understandable. He had a right to be angry and take the steps he did. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
