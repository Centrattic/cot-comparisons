It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, leading the author to kick her out and consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author and his fianc\u00e9 made a mutual decision to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9 gained weight. He found out she stopped going to the gym and was eating out, lying about her habits. He confronted her, got angry, and kicked her out. Now she's calling him controlling, and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement, deception, and the reaction. They both agreed to change their lifestyles. The author trusted her and supported her, even cooking meals. She lied about her gym attendance and eating habits, which led to a betrayal of trust. The author's anger and decision to end things might be justified because of the significant deceit.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been too harsh. Kicking her out and planning a breakup could be seen as an overreaction, especially if she was struggling with her health issues. But considering the year-long deception and the impact on their relationship, it's a valid response to broken trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's actions were deceitful. She knew about the mutual goals and lied consistently. The author's control over her membership and diet could be controlling, but since they agreed on the goals together, it's part of their shared commitment. Her hiding food and eating out goes against that agreement.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable given the betrayal. However, breaking up immediately after confrontation might not be the healthiest approach, but in the context of long-term dishonesty, it's a possible consequence. The fianc\u00e9's family calling him controlling might be their perspective, but the core issue is her deceit.\n\nSo, considering mutual agreement, her deception, and the author's justified anger, the answer leans towards B (author not in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9's actions were the main problem, and the author's response is a reaction to betrayal.\n"
