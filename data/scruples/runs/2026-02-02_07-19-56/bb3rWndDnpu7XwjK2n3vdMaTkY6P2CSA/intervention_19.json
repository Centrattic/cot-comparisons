It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9e decided together in 2018 to lose weight for health reasons, especially after the author's dad had a heart attack. They both committed to changing their lifestyles. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained weight instead. The author discovered that the fianc\u00e9e had been lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, and she's been eating out and hiding junk food. The author kicked her out and is considering breaking up, feeling hurt and betrayed because she lied about their shared commitment.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides. The author's actions stem from a concern for their health and their partner's well-being. They had a mutual agreement to change their lifestyles, so when the fianc\u00e9e stopped contributing and lied about it, that's a breach of trust. However, the author might have been controlling by enforcing these changes without considering the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy. The fianc\u00e9e claims she was forced into it, which complicates things. Was the author being supportive or controlling?\n\nOn one hand, the author had valid health concerns and both agreed on the plan. The lies about gym attendance and diet were significant because they undermined that agreement. On the other hand, maybe the author was too rigid, not allowing the fianc\u00e9e to have her own choices once the plan was set. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction that the author is trying to change who they are suggests that the author might have overstepped, especially if they were making decisions without considering the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy.\n\nThe key points are mutual agreement versus control. If they both agreed, then the fianc\u00e9e's lying is a betrayal. But if the author was pressuring her beyond what she could handle, that's an issue. The author's anger and decision to break up might be justified due to the lies and broken trust, but there's a line between being concerned and being controlling.\n\nI think the author's right to be upset about the lies is valid, but the way they handled the situation\u2014kicking her out and planning a breakup\u2014might be harsh. However, given the context of a mutual commitment that was broken through deception, the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e's actions were deceitful and undermined their shared goals.\n"
