It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up because she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, there's the context of their health goals. Both agreed to lose weight, which is a big commitment. The author lost 110 pounds, showing he's been dedicated. His fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, didn't lose weight and actually gained. He found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating out a lot. That's a breach of trust. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's at fault. The main points here are the lies she told. She stopped going to the gym months before, yet claimed she was still going. She also hid junk food and ate out, which contradicted their agreed-upon plan. Lying about such important matters, especially when it's central to their relationship goals, is a big deal. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and kicking her out. That's a strong response. But considering the betrayal of trust over a year, maybe it's understandable. He had invested a lot into their health journey, and her actions undermined that. Also, she's now calling him controlling, but he was following their mutual agreement. The problem is her not following through and lying about it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently. Kicking her out might be harsh, but if he's paying for the apartment, he might have the right to ask her to leave if he's not in a legal marriage yet. The key here is the breach of trust and the lies. The author's actions stem from discovering the lies and feeling betrayed. He's also planning to break up, which is a personal decision, but given the circumstances, it's hard to blame him for being upset. \n\nSo, considering the lies, the betrayal of trust, and the fact that they had a mutual agreement she didn't honor, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His reaction is a result of her actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
