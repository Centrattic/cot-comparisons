It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad, kicking out their fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after finding out she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple decided together to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained 60. The author discovered she wasn't going to the gym and was eating out, hiding junk food. The fianc\u00e9e lied about her habits and now claims the author is controlling.\n\nThe author is upset because they trusted her and both agreed to make changes for health reasons. The lie was about something they both considered important. The author confronted her, she admitted to lying, and he kicked her out. Now she's staying with her parents and sending texts calling him controlling. He's considering breaking up.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they made a mutual decision to get healthier. The fianc\u00e9e broke that agreement by lying and not following through. The author discovered the truth and acted on it, which could be seen as a justified response to betrayal. However, kicking someone out and threatening to break up is a big step. But considering the deceit was about something they both considered vital (health), maybe it's understandable. The author isn't forcing her to lose weight but was following through on a mutual goal. The fianc\u00e9e's defense of calling him controlling seems like she's deflecting responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like seeking counseling instead of immediate breakup. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The deceit is significant, so the author's reaction isn't entirely unjustified. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's lies and dishonesty about a shared commitment are the main issue. The author isn't controlling; he was following a mutual plan and found out she lied. His reaction, while harsh, is a response to betrayal. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
