It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out their fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up because she lied about not losing weight and wasn't following through on their agreed-upon health plan.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The couple had a mutual goal to lose weight after the author's father's heart attack. They both committed to it. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained weight and lied about going to the gym, eating out, etc. The author found out she was hiding junk food and not exercising. The fianc\u00e9e is now accusing the author of being controlling. The author kicked her out of the apartment they paid for and is considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual agreement on the health plan, the fianc\u00e9e's deceit, and the author's reaction. The author's actions are based on feeling betrayed after a year of lies. The fianc\u00e9e not only didn't follow through but also accused the author of controlling behavior. The author's response\u2014kicking her out and planning to break up\u2014seems like a reaction to the betrayal and deceit.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author had a legitimate concern for their health, which was a mutual goal. The fianc\u00e9e broke trust by lying repeatedly. While the author's reaction might be harsh, the deceit was significant and ongoing. However, the author's method of addressing it (kicking her out, not allowing her to stay) could be seen as extreme, especially if they had previously shown trust and support. Also, the author's initial motivation (health for both) was shared, so forcing the situation might be controlling if the fianc\u00e9e didn't want to participate. But the problem here was the fianc\u00e9e's deception, not the author's control. The author had the right to be upset and take action after discovering the lies. However, breaking up over this might be a big step, but given the betrayal, it's understandable. So, the author's actions are a response to the fianc\u00e9e's deceit, which might make them not in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. The author might have gone too far in the breakup decision, but the deceit was significant. It's a tough call. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the deceit was major, but some might argue the author's reaction was too harsh. However, given the context, the author's actions are a reaction to betrayal, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
