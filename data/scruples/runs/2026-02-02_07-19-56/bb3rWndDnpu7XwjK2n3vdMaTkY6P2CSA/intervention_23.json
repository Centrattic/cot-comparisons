It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, the context: Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight together after a health scare. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she was lying about going to the gym, eating junk food, and not following the agreed-upon plan. He kicked her out and is considering a breakup. \n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The key points here are mutual agreement on health goals, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty, and the author's reaction. When people set mutual goals, especially in a relationship, honesty is crucial. The fianc\u00e9e's lies about her activities undermined their shared commitment. The author had a valid reason for concern since their health was at stake. However, his reaction\u2014kicking her out and planning to break up\u2014might be seen as extreme. \n\nBut wait, there's a nuance. The author created a supportive environment by cooking healthy meals and going to the gym together. The fianc\u00e9e's deceit involved not just lying about her exercise but also hiding unhealthy habits. The author's anger stems from being lied to about something they both agreed was important. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach to weight loss might have been controlling. He mentions cooking every meal, which could be seen as overstepping. The fianc\u00e9e felt forced and now says he's trying to control her. This could indicate that the author's methods were too strict, leading to resentment. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The lying and deceit from the fianc\u00e9e is a major issue. However, the author's response\u2014kicking her out and threatening a breakup\u2014might be a reaction to her betrayal. But breaking up over this could be seen as a harsh punishment. \n\nConsidering both sides, while the fianc\u00e9e lied, the author's reaction may have been overly controlling from the start. His actions in setting strict rules and not respecting her autonomy could have contributed to the situation. However, the betrayal of trust is significant. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e's deceit was a breach of trust. But his controlling behavior might have played a role in the breakdown. Given the circumstances, the primary fault lies with the fianc\u00e9e. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
