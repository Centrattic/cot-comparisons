It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up because she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The fianc\u00e9e and the author both agreed to lose weight, which was a mutual goal for their health, especially after his dad's heart attack. He mentions they changed their eating habits, went to the gym daily, and he cooked for them. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. She was defensive and gave excuses. Then he found out she stopped going to the gym, lied about her exercise, and was eating out a lot. He confronted her, she got defensive, called him controlling, and he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the key points here: mutual agreement to change lifestyles, her deception, and his reaction. The author trusted her, gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she lied about her actions. He confronted her after realizing the truth, which is understandable. His actions (kicking her out, planning to break up) are reactions to her dishonesty and breaking their mutual agreement.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, lying in a relationship is a serious issue. If both parties agreed on a commitment, and one is not fulfilling their part through lies, that's a breach of trust. The author's anger and decision to break up could be seen as a response to her betrayal. However, controlling behavior might be a factor. If he was pressuring her to lose weight in a way that's unhealthy, maybe, but the story says they both agreed to the lifestyle changes. He even cooked for her, so it's a shared effort. Her hiding food and lying is her own choice.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's response, calling him controlling and changing her stance, might be deflecting blame. The author's decision to break up is due to her dishonesty, not just the weight loss issue. So, the main wrong here is the fianc\u00e9e's lying and breaking trust. The author isn't wrong for being upset and taking action after discovering the lies. Unless he was overly controlling without her consent, but the story indicates mutual agreement. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
