It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out their fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about not going to the gym and eating unhealthy. They also want to know if the author is being controlling.\n\nFirst, the backstory: Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight around 2018 after a health scare. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she stopped going to the gym and was eating junk food, lying about her habits. He confronted her, got angry, kicked her out, and now wants to break up. She's calling him controlling, and her family is attacking him too.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. He initiated the weight loss journey because of health concerns, and they both agreed on it. The fianc\u00e9e lied about her participation, which is a betrayal. The author had invested time, effort, and money (paying for her gym membership) into this mutual goal. Discovering that she was deceitful and not following through on their shared commitment must have been a significant emotional blow. His reaction\u2014anger, kicking her out, and considering a breakup\u2014seems like a response to broken trust and dishonesty.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if he was overly controlling. The question is whether his actions crossed a line. He mentions cooking for both of them, which could be seen as supportive, but if she felt forced into the weight loss, that could be controlling. But in this case, she admitted to hiding food and lying, which suggests she was actively resisting his healthy efforts. The author's anger is a reaction to betrayal after a year of deception. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's claims that he was controlling and that losing weight is changing who he is might be a deflection from her own lies. The author's decision to break up is based on her dishonesty and lack of commitment to their shared goals, which are valid reasons. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and repeated lies can justify ending it. \n\nSo, while the author's actions might seem harsh, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty and betrayal are significant. The answer likely is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's actions were the root cause, and the author's response is about addressing the broken trust.\n"
