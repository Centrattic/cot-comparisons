It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, leading the author to kick her out and consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, the author and his fianc\u00e9 agreed to lose weight together after a health scare. The author made a big effort, lost weight, and supported his fianc\u00e9. But she didn't lose weight and actually gained. He found out she was lying about going to the gym and not eating junk food. He got angry, kicked her out, and plans to break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The fianc\u00e9 lied repeatedly about her actions, which directly contradicted their mutual agreement. Lying about something as significant as health goals, especially when they had a shared commitment, is a big deal. The author trusted her and tried to support her, but she was deceptive. \n\nThe author's reaction: he confronted her, which is reasonable when discovering lies. Kicking her out because of the lies and betrayal of trust might be a strong move, but given the context of a shared commitment and her dishonesty, it's understandable. The texts from her family calling him controlling might add to the tension, but if she was the one lying and not following through, the fault isn't on him.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of immediately kicking her out and threatening a breakup, perhaps communication or seeking couples counseling would have been better. But the core issue is her deception. The author isn't forcing her to lose weight per se; they agreed together. She's now blaming him for controlling, but he was part of a mutual decision.\n\nIn terms of being controlling, the author was cooking healthy meals and supporting her, which isn't controlling. The problem was her lies and not following through. The author's anger is a result of betrayal after making a joint commitment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to her dishonesty. The fianc\u00e9's actions were the main issue.\n"
