It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, and the author is considering breaking up with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their fianc\u00e9 made a mutual decision to lose weight after the author's father's heart attack. The author lost a significant amount of weight, but the fianc\u00e9 gained weight. The author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 had been lying about going to the gym and eating unhealthy food. The author confronted her, got angry, kicked her out, and is planning to break up.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. They decided to lose weight together, which is a shared goal. The fianc\u00e9, however, wasn't following through and lied about her habits. The author had the right to be concerned about their health, especially since they had both agreed on this path. The deception seems to be a major issue here. The author's anger is understandable because of the dishonesty and the betrayal of trust.\n\nBut wait, is the author being controlling? The fianc\u00e9 claims the author forced her to lose weight. However, since they both agreed on the goal, it's a mutual decision. The author even mentions preparing healthy meals for both, which shows they were supportive. The issue is the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty and lack of effort, not the author's control. The author is reacting to the lies and the broken agreement.\n\nThe key here is the breach of trust. Lying about something as significant as their health goals, especially after agreeing to them together, is a serious issue. The author's decision to confront and consider breaking up is a reaction to that betrayal. While the author's reaction might be harsh, the underlying issue is the fianc\u00e9's deceit. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lies and seeking to end the relationship if the trust is broken.\n\nSo, answering whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the main problem. The author's response, while intense, is a reaction to the lies and broken promises. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
