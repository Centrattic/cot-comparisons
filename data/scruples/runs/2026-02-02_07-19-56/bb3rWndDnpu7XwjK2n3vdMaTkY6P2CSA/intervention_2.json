It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about her weight loss efforts. The author set a goal to lose weight after his dad's health scare and convinced his fianc\u00e9 to do the same. They both committed, but she ended up gaining weight instead. He found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, and now he's planning to break up with her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was concerned about their health, which is valid. He made a commitment together with his fianc\u00e9, and she didn't follow through. The lies were significant\u2014she stopped going to the gym and ate unhealthy food, which contradicts their agreement. The author felt betrayed because she didn't meet the mutual goals they set.\n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9's actions were deceitful. Lying about such a personal and committed goal could be a breach of trust. The author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and planning a breakup\u2014might seem harsh, but the betrayal could justify it. On the other hand, maybe the author was controlling by pushing her to diet, but the fianc\u00e9 had agreed to the plan. However, her lying makes it a double standard.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's defense that the author was controlling is a bit tricky. They had both agreed to the lifestyle changes, so maybe she's projecting her own lack of commitment. The author's anger is understandable given the betrayal. The key here is whether the author had the right to enforce this health plan. But since they made a mutual decision, and she broke that trust, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nI should also think about the impact of the lies. The author invested time and effort, and the lies could have led to health risks for both. The fianc\u00e9's reaction to the author's weight loss being \"wrong\" seems manipulative. The author's decision to break up is a response to the betrayal rather than the health goals themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9 broke their mutual commitment through deception. The author had a right to feel betrayed and take action. So the answer is B.\n"
