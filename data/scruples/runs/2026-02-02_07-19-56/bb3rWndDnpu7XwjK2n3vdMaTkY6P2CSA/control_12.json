It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's dad had a heart attack related to weight, which scared him. He was also over 450 pounds, and his fianc\u00e9e was over 500. They both decided to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. The author made healthy meals for both of them, and they went to the gym. The fianc\u00e9e claimed the weight gain was due to water or thyroid issues. The author trusted her. Then the gym owner told the author that the fianc\u00e9e hadn't been coming to the gym, so the author confronted her. Turns out the fianc\u00e9e had been lying about going to the gym, eating out twice a day, not exercising, hiding junk food. The author kicked her out and is planning to break up. The fianc\u00e9e and her family are calling the author controlling. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. They both agreed to a health plan. The author followed through, lost a lot of weight, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't. She lied about her gym attendance, diet, and hid her actions. When confronted, she blamed the author for being controlling and even criticized his weight loss. The author kicked her out of the apartment he pays for because of the lies and the betrayal after they agreed on this health plan together.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the author set clear expectations they both agreed on. The fianc\u00e9e intentionally lied about following through, which is a breach of trust. The author was honest and made efforts, while the fianc\u00e9e hid things. The author's reaction is anger and kicking her out. The fianc\u00e9e's side is that she doesn't want to lose weight but was forced, which seems like a justification after the fact. The author's actions stem from the lies and broken trust, not just wanting control. The author is also hurt because they were working together for health, which is a mutual goal.\n\nIs the author controlling? Well, they were working on a plan they agreed on, and the author made meals for both. But the fianc\u00e9e wasn't honest about her behavior. The author's actions are a response to being lied to, not just controlling. Breaking up because of dishonesty is a personal choice, but the lies were about a shared commitment. The fianc\u00e9e's claims of control might come from the author's efforts to support the health plan, but the main issue is the deception.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the fianc\u00e9e lied and didn't follow through on a mutual agreement, which is a serious issue. The author's anger and decision to break up are reactions to betrayal. While the author might have been strict in their approach, the core problem is the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset and taking action after being lied to for a year. The fianc\u00e9e's actions are the main problem here.\n"
