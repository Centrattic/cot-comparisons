It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad, kicking his fianc\u00e9e out, and planning to break up after finding out she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym. \n\nFirst, the context is that both he and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight in 2018. He lost 110 pounds, but she gained weight and he later found out she was lying about her gym attendance and eating habits. He confronted her, she got defensive, and he kicked her out. Now he's planning to break up and is wondering if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual agreement to lose weight, her deception, and his reaction. The author argues that they both agreed on the health goals. She lied about her efforts, which he discovered through a third party. He confronted her, she was defensive, and he's taking actions that are causing a breakup.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, lying is a big issue. Trust is fundamental, and if one partner is being deceptive about something they agreed on, that's a problem. However, the author's approach is to kick her out and break up. That's a significant reaction. But maybe the deception was prolonged and deliberate, which could justify his anger.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was being controlling. The fianc\u00e9e said she didn't want to lose weight but felt forced. If the original agreement wasn't mutual or if he was pressuring her, that could be an issue. But the user says they both agreed. However, maybe the pressure led her to lie instead of being honest about not wanting to participate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the deception was about something they both agreed on, and the author acted in good faith, then maybe he's justified. But if he was controlling and the breakup is overreacting, maybe not. The lies about the gym and eating out were deliberate and hidden, leading to a loss of trust. The author's reaction might be harsh, but betrayal can be a reason to end a relationship.\n\nSo, considering the mutual agreement, the deceit, and the author's actions, it's a tough call. But since the fianc\u00e9e was lying about agreed-upon commitments, the author might feel justified. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out and breaking up\u2014could be seen as extreme. But the text says he's planning to break up, which might be a response to her lying. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the control was part of the problem, then maybe he is. The fianc\u00e9e's claim that he's controlling adds another layer. But since they both agreed initially, maybe her resistance came later.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because of the betrayal and the breaking of trust. However, some might argue that his reaction is too harsh. But given the context of her lying for a year about something they both agreed on, the author's anger and decision to break up could be seen as justified.\n"
