It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e lying about not losing weight, which led to him kicking her out and planning to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple decided together in 2018 to lose weight. The author lost 110 pounds, but his fianc\u00e9e gained 60. He found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, instead eating out and hiding junk food. He confronted her, she became defensive, and he kicked her out. Now he's questioning if he's being controlling.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether lying about health goals and not following through is a deal-breaker. The author trusted her and gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she was deceptive. On the other hand, maybe the author was too controlling by not respecting her autonomy, even if they had mutual goals.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment on the author's actions. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nI should consider if lying in a relationship about such a serious shared goal is acceptable. Also, the author did confront her after discovering the lies. Her reaction (calling him controlling) might indicate that she felt pressured, but she also admitted to hiding food and lying. The author's anger and decision to break up might be a reaction to betrayal and lack of trust.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If both agreed on the health goals, then lying about participation could be a breach of that agreement. However, the author might have overstepped by controlling her eating habits. But in this case, the fianc\u00e9e was actively deceptive, which could justify his reaction.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author acted on discovering deceit that went against their mutual goals, leading to a loss of trust. His actions are a response to betrayal. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. But then again, maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier instead of waiting until the end. But given the circumstances, his response seems proportionate. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
