It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9e agreed to lose weight together. The author lost a lot of weight, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't and ended up gaining weight. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, so he kicked her out and wants to break up. The question is if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple made a mutual decision to change their lifestyle for health reasons. The author did their part, but the fianc\u00e9e wasn't following through. She lied about her gym attendance and eating habits. The author confronted her after discovering the lies and is now considering a breakup. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they were trying to maintain a healthy life together. The lies about the gym and diet could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The fact that she was hiding junk food and eating out a lot suggests she wasn't committed to the agreement. The author might feel that her actions undermined their shared goals, leading to justified anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction could be seen as harsh. Kicking her out and planning a breakup might be an overreaction. The fianc\u00e9e might argue that the author was being controlling, especially if she felt pressured into the weight loss journey. The author's initial approach of cooking for both of them might have been seen as overstepping, contributing to her resentment. Also, communication could have been an issue. Maybe they should have had more open discussions about their feelings towards the changes instead of the author taking a more controlling role.\n\nBut considering the context of a mutual agreement to improve health, the author had a legitimate concern when the other person wasn't following through. The lies are a significant betrayal, especially since they were part of a shared commitment. The author's anger might be a reaction to broken trust and the health implications for both of them. However, the method of handling it\u2014kicking her out and planning a breakup\u2014might be too drastic. Perhaps the author should have addressed the issues earlier before things escalated.\n\nAnother angle is that the author may have been too controlling in the first place, which the fianc\u00e9e now claims. If the author's approach was authoritarian, making her feel forced into the lifestyle changes, that could have led to her rebellion and lying. In healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy. The author might not have considered her perspective and feelings, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the lies and broken trust are significant, but the author's response might be excessive. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were deceitful, but the author's approach to the partnership might have contributed to the problem. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate to the situation. Kicking her out and breaking up could be seen as a valid response to betrayal, but it's also possible that the author could have handled it differently with more communication and support.\n"
