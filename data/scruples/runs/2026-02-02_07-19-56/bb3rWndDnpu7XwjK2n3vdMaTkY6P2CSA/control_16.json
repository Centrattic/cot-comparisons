It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, the context: Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but his fianc\u00e9e gained 60. He found out she was lying about going to the gym, eating junk food, and not exercising. He felt betrayed because they had agreed on this health journey together. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling him controlling and denying that she wanted to lose weight initially. The author kicked her out of the apartment and is considering a breakup.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether his actions are justified. On one hand, he had a legitimate reason for concern. They made a mutual decision to improve their health, and she lied about her efforts, which could affect both their health. The author's reaction might be seen as a response to her dishonesty and the betrayal of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting. The fianc\u00e9e could argue that she has the right to her own body and that he was being controlling by pushing her to lose weight. However, since they both agreed on the health goals, her deception is a significant factor. The author's anger and decision to break up stem from her breaking their agreement and lying, which is a valid reason for feeling wronged.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's claims that he's controlling and that he's trying to change who he is (by losing weight) might be her way of deflecting responsibility. The fact that she hid junk food and lied about gym attendance shows a lack of commitment to their shared goals. The author's actions, while harsh, might be a reaction to her deceit and the impact on their relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His actions are a response to a breach of trust and unmet commitments they both agreed upon. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have some responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty and lack of effort are key points. The author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as justified given the circumstances, so the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
