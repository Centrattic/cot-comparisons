It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after finding out she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, the context: They both agreed to lose weight, the author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she was lying about going to the gym, eating out, and hiding junk food. He confronted her, and she accused him of being controlling. He kicked her out and plans to break up. She's now calling him a monster.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual agreement on health goals, her deception, his reaction. The question is whether his actions are justified.\n\nI need to consider if he's overstepping by enforcing their mutual goals, but since it was a mutual decision, maybe she's not forced. However, if she felt forced, that's an issue. But he set up the gym membership for both, cooked meals, etc. Maybe he was controlling, but she agreed to it. But lying for a year is a big betrayal.\n\nHer lying about going to the gym and eating habits is a problem. Trust is broken. But kicking her out and breaking up is a harsh reaction. However, given the deceit over a year, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIs he in the wrong for being angry? Maybe not, since she lied. But is he controlling? If he was forcing her to lose weight, that's another issue. But the initial agreement was mutual. However, if she felt forced, that's a red flag. The question is whether his actions are justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. She lied repeatedly, which is a major issue. His reaction is anger and breaking up. It's possible both are at fault. But the main issue is her deception. He might not be in the wrong for standing up for himself after betrayal. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
