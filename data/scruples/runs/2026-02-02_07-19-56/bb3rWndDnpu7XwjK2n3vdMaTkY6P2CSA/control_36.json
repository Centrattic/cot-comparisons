It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and planning to break up with his fianc\u00e9e after finding out she lied about not losing weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They both decided in 2018 to lose weight for health reasons. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she stopped going to the gym and was eating out, lying to him. He kicked her out and wants to break up. She's calling him controlling now.\n\nSo, the main points are: mutual decision to change, she lied about her efforts, he discovered the truth, he's upset and wants to end things. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. If she lied about her commitment to their shared goal, that's a breach of trust. He had to cook meals and change their eating habits, which she wasn't following. Her deception might have undermined their mutual agreement. \n\nBut was he being controlling? They agreed together to make changes. If she felt forced, maybe there's an issue. However, he supported her, gave her the benefit of the doubt, and trusted her. Her lies are a problem. \n\nIn terms of breaking up, if she broke the trust, it's understandable he's hurt. But maybe he should have addressed it earlier. However, he did confront her after finding out. Her family's texts calling him a monster might indicate she's not taking responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's deception is a major factor here. The answer is B.\n"
