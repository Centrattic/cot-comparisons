It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for getting mad, kicking their fianc\u00e9e out, and planning to break up with her because she lied about not losing weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their fianc\u00e9e made a mutual decision in 2018 to lose weight after the author's dad had a heart attack. They both committed to changing their habits. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained 60. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, and she was actually eating junk food and not exercising. The author got angry, kicked her out, and is considering breaking up. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the author controlling and blaming him for forcing her to lose weight.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI should consider the key points here. Both made a mutual decision to lose weight. The author supported the fianc\u00e9e, cooked for both, etc. The fianc\u00e9e lied about her eating and exercise, which is a breach of trust. The author confronted her, which seems reasonable given the deception. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out and break up. The fianc\u00e9e's response is to accuse the author of being controlling. \n\nBut wait, did the author push the fianc\u00e9e into this? The original decision was mutual, so it's not like the author forced her. The fianc\u00e9e's lies are her own choice. The author's anger stems from betrayal, which is understandable. However, the method of response\u2014kicking her out and breaking up\u2014might be seen as harsh. But given the level of deceit over a year, maybe not entirely wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation was health, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty could have jeopardized both their health. The author's actions were a reaction to the lies, which are the fianc\u00e9e's fault. However, is it wrong to break up over this? Relationships require trust, and betrayal can be grounds for ending a relationship. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like seeking counseling first. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is justified in their anger due to betrayal, then they aren't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were deceitful, so the author's response might be seen as justified. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is holding themselves to a higher standard, maybe the reaction is too extreme. But given the circumstances, it's a matter of perspective. The key is whether the author acted unfairly. The author provided support, the fianc\u00e9e lied, and the author's response was to take action. It's a complex situation, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e's actions were deceitful and the author's response was a consequence of broken trust.\n"
