It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where they found out their fianc\u00e9e lied about not losing weight, kicked her out, and are planning to break up. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a wake-up call when their dad had a heart attack related to weight. They and their fianc\u00e9e decided in 2018 to get healthier, changed their habits, and the author lost 110 pounds. However, the fianc\u00e9e gained weight and the author discovered she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy. The author confronted her, found out she was eating out, not exercising, hiding junk food, and now she's blaming the author for being controlling. The author kicked her out and is considering a breakup.\n\nNow, the key points: mutual agreement to get healthier, the author's efforts, the fianc\u00e9e's deceit, and the author's reaction. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e agreed to the weight loss program, so she had a role in that decision. However, she lied about her participation. The author discovered the lies, which led to conflict. The author's anger and decision to kick her out and break up are in question.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author too controlling? Did they cross a line by not respecting her autonomy? Or was the fianc\u00e9e's deceit a betrayal, justifying the author's actions?\n\nOn one hand, the author had a legitimate concern about health, given their father's heart attack. They made a mutual decision, so maybe the author was right to be invested. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to lie and hide her behavior might be a breach of trust. The author's reaction could be seen as justified if the trust was broken. But the author might have overreacted by kicking her out and planning a breakup, maybe without addressing the issue constructively, like seeking counseling or giving her a chance to be honest.\n\nBut considering the lies were about health, which directly relates to their mutual goal and the author's health concerns, the betrayal could be significant. The author might feel that the lies were a major issue, especially if they believed the fianc\u00e9e was not committed to their shared goal.\n\nHowever, the author's approach of confrontation and immediate breakup might be seen as harsh. Perhaps there's a middle ground where they could have talked things out without ending the relationship. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction of calling the author controlling and the family's texts might indicate she's defensive, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for being upset about the lies, but maybe their response was too extreme. However, the fianc\u00e9e's deceit was a betrayal of trust, so the author's anger is understandable. I think the answer might be B (no), because the author isn't in the wrong if the fianc\u00e9e was lying and breaking their agreement. However, maybe there's a nuance where the author's approach could be seen as controlling, but the initial decision to get healthy was mutual. The author's actions are a reaction to deceit, which is a valid reason for a breakup. So probably B (no).\n"
