It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9e agreed to lose weight together, right? The author lost a lot of weight, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, so they kicked her out and plan to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to be concerned about their health after their dad's heart attack. They made a mutual decision to get healthier, which is a positive goal. But then the fianc\u00e9e didn't follow through. She lied about going to the gym and eating properly, which is a breach of trust. That's a big deal in a relationship. Trust is fundamental.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction is to kick her out and plan a breakup. Is that overreacting? Well, lying about something as important as health goals, especially when they were agreed upon together, could be seen as a serious betrayal. The fianc\u00e9e also claims the author was controlling, which might be a factor. But was the author being controlling? They mention cooking healthy meals for both, which could be supportive, but maybe crossing into controlling if it wasn't consensual anymore. However, the fianc\u00e9e admitted to lying and hiding junk food, which suggests she wasn't in it together anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the lies and the breach of trust. The author had a right to be upset about being deceived, especially over such a long period. The fianc\u00e9e's actions led to the author feeling betrayed, which is understandable. The author's response might be harsh, but given the circumstances of ongoing deceit, it's a personal choice about how to handle the relationship. \n\nBut maybe the author could have addressed the lying earlier instead of letting it build up. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong now. The fianc\u00e9e's lies and the author's reaction to them\u2014kicking her out after discovering the deception\u2014seems like a natural consequence. Unless there's more context about the author's behavior that's controlling, but the fianc\u00e9e herself accused them of that. However, the author's actions of providing healthy meals and going to the gym together might not be controlling unless forced. The fianc\u00e9e had the choice to participate or not.\n\nIn summary, the fianc\u00e9e lied repeatedly about their shared goals, which is a major issue. The author's anger and decision to break up stem from that betrayal. Unless the author was indeed being overbearing in a controlling way, which isn't clearly stated here, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
