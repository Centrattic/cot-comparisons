It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 who lied about her weight loss efforts, leading the author to kick her out and consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple decided together in 2018 to change their lifestyles for health reasons after a wake-up call from the author's father's heart attack. Both committed to losing weight. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9 gained weight. She lied about going to the gym and eating healthy, which the author discovered through a mutual gym owner. The author confronted her and now is considering a breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider elements like mutual agreements, trust, and control. The couple made a joint decision, so the author's concern for her health might be valid. However, the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and threatening to break up\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if there's a history of controlling behavior. The fianc\u00e9's denial and deflection could indicate issues in communication or personal responsibility. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be upset about the lies and betrayal of trust. On the other hand, if the author was overly controlling in the weight loss efforts, that could be a problem. The fianc\u00e9's claims that the author is controlling might be valid if the author imposed restrictions without considering her feelings.\n\nBut the initial agreement was mutual, so the author's frustration is understandable. The lies and deceit from the fianc\u00e9's side are significant. The author's decision to kick her out might be a reaction to the betrayal rather than being controlling. However, the breakup as a response might be extreme. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9 broke trust and failed to meet mutual goals. The key issue here is the deception and lack of accountability from the fianc\u00e9. The author's reaction stems from the betrayal rather than controlling behavior. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
