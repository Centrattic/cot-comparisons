It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking their fianc\u00e9e out, and planning a breakup after discovering the lies about her not losing weight.\n\nFirst, the context: They both committed to a health journey after a family health scare. The author lost weight, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't. She lied about going to the gym and eating properly. The author found out she was hiding junk food and eating out, which they didn't know. The author feels betrayed because their decision to change their lives together was a mutual agreement. When confronted, the fianc\u00e9e blames the author for being controlling and even accuses him of trying to change who he is. The author responds by kicking her out and considering a breakup.\n\nSo, the main points here are deception, betrayal of trust, and differing priorities. The author might feel that the lies were a significant breach of trust, especially since they were working on a health goal together. The fianc\u00e9e's actions could be seen as undermining their shared commitment. However, the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and planning a breakup\u2014could be seen as harsh. But maybe the betrayal was severe enough to justify it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have contributed to the problem by being too controlling. Maybe pushing too hard for weight loss and cooking all meals made her feel resentful, leading to her lying. The fianc\u00e9e's claims that the author is controlling might have some validity. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the actions taken after the betrayal. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions (kicking her out, breakup plans) are a reasonable response to the lies and deceit. Since the fianc\u00e9e lied for a year about something they both agreed was important, the author's anger and decision to break up might be seen as justified. But some might argue that the author should have addressed it differently without evicting her immediately. However, given the circumstances, the trust was broken, and the author felt deceived. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. The betrayal was significant, and their reaction, while intense, stems from hurt and a feeling of being lied to. The answer would be B (No).\n"
