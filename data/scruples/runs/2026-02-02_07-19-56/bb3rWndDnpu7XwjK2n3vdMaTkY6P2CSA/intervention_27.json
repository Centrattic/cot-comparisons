It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about his fianc\u00e9e lying about not losing weight. They both agreed to get healthier after his dad's heart attack and his realization about his own weight. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight and he found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy. He kicked her out and wants to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to be concerned about their health, especially since his dad had a heart attack. They made a mutual decision to change their lifestyles. The fianc\u00e9e, however, didn't follow through. She stopped going to the gym, ate out a lot, and hid junk food. She also lied about it, which the author discovered through the gym owner. The author felt betrayed and kicked her out.\n\nNow, the author's reaction: he got angry, kicked her out, and plans to break up. Is this justified? On one hand, lying and not following through on a mutual agreement they both made could be a major breach of trust. The author was honest and worked hard, while she was deceptive. The betrayal of trust is a big deal in a relationship. On the other hand, maybe the author was too controlling? Did he push her too hard, making her rebel? She claims he forced her to lose weight and that she doesn't want to. So maybe there was an element of control from his side, which could be problematic.\n\nBut the key here is the lies. They agreed on a health goal together. If she lied about her participation and hid her actions, that's a serious issue. The author had every right to feel hurt and betrayed. Also, the fact that she was spending money on membership she wasn't using is a financial issue too. However, his immediate reaction was to kick her out and plan a breakup. Is that an overreaction? Maybe. Relationships have ups and downs, and even with betrayal, sometimes couples work through it. But the extent of the lies and her behavior might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's response\u2014calling him controlling and that he's trying to change who he is\u2014might be her way of deflecting. But if she was never on board with the health goals, maybe she should have been honest from the start. The author trusted her, gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she kept lying. So, the author's anger and decision to end things could be justified given the deceit and broken trust.\n\nIn terms of control, if the author was pressuring her constantly and making her feel forced, that's a problem. But the story says they both agreed to the health goals. So maybe the issue is more about her dishonesty rather than him being controlling. The fact that she hid her actions and lied repeatedly shows a lack of integrity. The author's reaction is a result of being lied to about something they both thought was important. \n\nI think the main issue here is the betrayal of trust through lying. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for being upset and wanting to end the relationship after such deceit. While his approach might be harsh, the root cause is her dishonesty. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
