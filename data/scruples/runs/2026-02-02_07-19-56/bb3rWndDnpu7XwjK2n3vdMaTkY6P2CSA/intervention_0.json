It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9e lied about not losing weight, and he kicked her out and plans to break up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his fianc\u00e9e decided together to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but his fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she lied about going to the gym and eating healthy, and she's now calling him controlling. He kicked her out and is planning to break up. He's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nNow, considering the context: they both agreed on the health goals. The author supported her, changed their habits, cooked meals, etc. So he's not forcing her, they had a mutual decision. The fianc\u00e9e stopped going to the gym, lied about it, and hid junk food. That's a big betrayal, right? Lying for a whole year about her actions undermines their agreement. The author confronted her, found out the truth, and was upset. Kicking her out of the apartment he pays for\u2014maybe that's harsh, but given the betrayal, some might see it as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did blow up at her. He might have overreacted, but the betrayal was significant. The fianc\u00e9e is now blaming him for being controlling, but she was the one not following through. Her family's texts also seem to be adding to the conflict. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to being lied to for a year. He's hurt and planning to break up. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether lying and breaking trust justifies his reaction. If the author was genuinely supportive and the fianc\u00e9e broke trust, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being too controlling, then A. However, since they had a mutual goal and he was helping her, his actions might be seen as self-defense after betrayal. So, maybe B is correct here.\n"
