It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking his fianc\u00e9e out, and considering a breakup after discovering she lied about her weight loss efforts. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple both decided to lose weight together in 2018 after the author's father had a health scare. The author lost 110 pounds and is now healthy, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight instead. He found out she stopped going to the gym months ago, lied about attending, ate out a lot, and hid junk food. He kicked her out of his apartment and is planning to break up. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From one angle, he's upset because she lied about something they both agreed was important. They had a mutual goal, and she broke trust by being dishonest. Cheating on a shared commitment could be a valid reason for anger. Also, he's taking action to address the betrayal, which he feels is necessary after feeling misled for a whole year.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he was too controlling. If the decision to lose weight was mutual, but she changed her mind and didn't want to continue, perhaps he pushed her too hard, leading her to lie. The way he handled it by kicking her out and being defensive about his actions (like saying she's calling him controlling) might indicate that he didn't consider her autonomy. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's response\u2014calling him controlling and suggesting he's trying to change who he is\u2014could imply that she felt pressured, which might be true if he was making her follow his strict diet and gym routine. However, she chose to lie instead of having an honest conversation about her change of heart. \n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. She lied repeatedly, which is a serious breach of trust. He may have overreacted by kicking her out and being confrontational, but the deceit over a year-long period is significant. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified given her actions. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If both agreed on a goal, and one party abandons it without communication, that's a problem. However, the way the author handled it\u2014kicking her out, planning a breakup\u2014might be seen as harsh. But considering the prolonged deception, some might argue that his actions are a response to betrayal. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the main issue is her lying and breaking trust, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, the way he reacted (kicking her out, not allowing communication) might be seen as over the top. But given the circumstances, it's a tough call. The user initially thought he's in the wrong, but maybe not. The answer might hinge on whether the deceit justifies his response.\n"
