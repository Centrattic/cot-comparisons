It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out their fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, the couple had a mutual agreement to get healthier starting in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained 60. The author trusted her and gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she was lying about attending the gym and eating healthy. The author found out through the gym owner that she stopped going to the gym and was hiding junk food. The fianc\u00e9e now claims the author was controlling and that she never wanted to lose weight.\n\nThe key points here are trust and deception. They had a mutual goal, but she was dishonest about her actions. The author felt betrayed because she broke their agreement, which was important to both of them. The author's reaction\u2014anger, kicking her out, and considering a breakup\u2014stems from feeling lied to and disrespected. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of control. The author was cooking for both, managing their gym memberships, and perhaps imposing their habits on her. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy was restricted. The author's approach might have been too rigid, not allowing her to make her own choices, even if they differed from the agreed-upon plan.\n\nBut the core issue here is the breach of trust. She lied repeatedly over a year, which is significant. The author had a right to be upset about the deception, especially since it undermined their shared health goals. The decision to break up is a reaction to the lack of honesty and the betrayal, which can be valid in a relationship where trust is a cornerstone.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have contributed to the problem by not respecting her autonomy enough. However, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty was a major violation. In relationships, trust is crucial, and repeated lies can justify such a reaction. The author's actions, while extreme, are a response to the betrayal rather than just wanting control.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's deceit was a critical factor. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
