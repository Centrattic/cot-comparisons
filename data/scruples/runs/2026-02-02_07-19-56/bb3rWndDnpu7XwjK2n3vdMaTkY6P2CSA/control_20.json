It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry and breaking up with their fianc\u00e9e after discovering she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym. \n\nFirst, the backstory: Both the author and their fianc\u00e9e decided in 2018 to lose weight after the author's father had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained 60. The author found out she had been lying about going to the gym and eating unhealthy food. The author then kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty and trust. The author and fianc\u00e9e had a mutual goal, and the fianc\u00e9e lied about her actions. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e didn't follow through, leading to a breakdown in trust. The author's reaction\u2014anger, kicking her out, planning a breakup\u2014might be seen as extreme, but the betrayal could justify it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author's approach was too controlling. They mention cooking meals for both, which might make the fianc\u00e9e feel pressured. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction to the author's weight loss being \"wrong\" suggests she felt controlled. The author might have been overstepping by not respecting her autonomy, even if they had good intentions.\n\nBut in this case, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's lies. She broke the agreement they both made. The author has the right to be upset about being deceived. While the author's methods might be harsh, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty is a significant breach of trust. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry and breaking up, but there might be room for both to take some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e lied, the author's reaction is more justified. The answer is B.\n"
