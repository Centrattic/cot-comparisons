It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and breaking up with his fianc\u00e9e after discovering she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, the context: Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight in 2018. The author made significant changes, lost weight, and took steps to support them both. However, the fianc\u00e9e didn't lose weight and eventually stopped going to the gym, hiding her lack of effort. The author found out through the gym owner and confronted her, leading to a breakup.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author and fianc\u00e9e had a mutual agreement to pursue healthier lifestyles. The fianc\u00e9e misrepresented her actions, which the author discovered after a year. The author felt betrayed and decided to break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9e lied about her participation in their shared goal, which the author trusted her on. However, the author also admits to being controlling by cooking meals and monitoring her habits. There's a balance between supporting a partner and being overbearing. The fianc\u00e9e's deception is a significant issue, but the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and planning a breakup\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if there was no prior communication about boundaries.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions of hiding food and lying are definitely wrong, but the author's approach could contribute to a toxic environment. The breakup seems a result of broken trust and differing priorities. However, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the extent of control he exerted. If he was overly controlling and contributed to her resistance, that's a problem. But if he was supportive and she was dishonest, the blame isn't entirely on him. It's a complex situation where both parties had issues. The author might not be entirely wrong, but his reaction could be seen as extreme. However, given the betrayal and her lack of transparency, his decision to end the relationship might be justified. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
