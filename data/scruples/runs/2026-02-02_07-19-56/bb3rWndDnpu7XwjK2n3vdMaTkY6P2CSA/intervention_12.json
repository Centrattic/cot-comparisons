It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, the author kicked her out, and is planning to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and his fianc\u00e9 had agreed to get healthier after his dad's heart attack. They both set a goal to lose weight. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't lose any and actually gained. She lied about going to the gym and eating healthy. The author found out she was lying, confronted her, and now she's staying at her parents' house, calling him controlling.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for getting angry, kicking her out, and planning to break up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had a valid concern about their health and agreed to a joint goal. The fianc\u00e9's deception is a big issue. Lying about not following through on commitments they both made is a betrayal of trust. The author's reaction is understandable given the lie and the impact on their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was too controlling by cooking for both of them and enforcing diet rules. But the fianc\u00e9 agreed to the plan, so it's a mutual decision. The lies and hiding food suggest she wasn't committed to the plan, which the author had a right to be upset about.\n\nThe author's actions (kicking her out, breaking up) are reactive, but after a year of lying, the trust is broken. The fianc\u00e9 is now blaming the author for being controlling, but she was the one who lied. The author's anger is justified given the deceit.\n\nSo, the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's lies and betrayal are the main issues. The author's actions are a response to her dishonesty, which is a valid reason for breaking up.\n"
