It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e lied about not losing weight. They both made a commitment to get healthier after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e actually gained weight and was being dishonest about her gym attendance and eating habits. The author found out through the gym owner that she wasn't going to the gym and was hiding junk food. The author kicked her out and is considering breaking up. The fianc\u00e9e is calling the author controlling. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Both agreed on a health plan. The author followed through and succeeded, while the fianc\u00e9e didn't and lied about her progress. The lies were significant\u2014going to the gym daily versus not going at all, eating out, hiding junk food. This seems like a breach of trust because they had a mutual agreement. The author felt betrayed when they discovered the lies. The author's reaction was anger and kicking her out, which is a big step, but maybe justified given the deceit.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e is calling the author controlling. There's a question of whether the author was being overbearing. The author mentions they cooked meals for both and wanted to be healthy together. But if the fianc\u00e9e felt forced into it, maybe the approach was too strict. However, the issue here is the dishonesty from the fianc\u00e9e, not just the author's control. The author trusted her and gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she lied for a whole year. That's a major betrayal.\n\nControl issues can be a factor. If the author was pushing the fianc\u00e9e too hard without considering her autonomy, that could be a problem. But the story doesn't say the author forced her into anything\u2014she agreed to the plan. The problem is her lying and not following through. The author's anger and decision to break up might be an overreaction, but considering the year-long deceit, maybe it's understandable. However, kicking someone out of the apartment and planning a breakup after a confrontation can come off as harsh. There might be a lack of communication or attempts to resolve the issue before taking such drastic action.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9e's lies broke that trust. The author's response might be justified if the lies were the main issue, but maybe there's a balance to consider. The author's actions could be seen as a response to betrayal rather than control. However, if the author's methods of enforcing the health plan were too controlling from the start, that could contribute to the fianc\u00e9e's resentment and lying. The question is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the lies or an overreaction.\n\nSo, weighing the deceit against the author's reaction: the lies were significant and ongoing, which justifies the anger. But breaking up immediately might be a harsh response. However, the author might feel that the trust is irreparably broken. The fianc\u00e9e's response of calling the author a monster could indicate manipulation. The author is in a tough spot, but the core issue is the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty. The author's actions are a reaction to that, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a possibility that the author's control might have contributed to the fianc\u00e9e's rebellion and lies. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, given the situation. The answer might hinge on whether the author's control was reasonable or not. If the author was pushing too hard, maybe they are at fault. But if they were both on board and the fianc\u00e9e lied, then the author isn't wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given the deceit, I think the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
