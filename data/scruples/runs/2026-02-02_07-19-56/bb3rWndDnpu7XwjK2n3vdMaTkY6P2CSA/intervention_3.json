It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after she lied to him about not going to the gym and eating poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided together to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, while she gained weight. He says she lied about going to the gym and eating healthy. He found out from the gym owner that she hadn't been going, and she was hiding junk food. He confronted her, she got defensive, and he kicked her out. Now he's considering breaking up, and the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author might feel betrayed. They had a mutual goal, and she lied about her actions. That could lead to justified anger. On the other hand, maybe he's being controlling by dictating her choices, especially if she felt forced. The fianc\u00e9e claims he was controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but was pressured. \n\nIs lying to him about her health choices a betrayal of their agreement? If they set this goal together, maybe she breaking her part of the deal is a breach of trust. However, if he was pressuring her into it, that's another issue. The key point is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to her dishonesty or if he overreacted.\n\nAlso, the author is paying for the apartment, so kicking her out might be a financial decision, but if they're engaged, that's a big step. Breaking up after a year of lying might be justified if he trusted her and she broke that trust. But if he was being overbearing and she was just trying to maintain her autonomy, maybe he's the one being controlling.\n\nI need to balance the aspects of trust, mutual goals, and respect. The author's anger is understandable, but kicking someone out and planning a breakup is a severe reaction. However, if the lies were about something they both agreed on, it's a breach of the agreement they made. The fianc\u00e9e's deceit is a problem, but the author's control over her habits could also be an issue. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the author's response was proportionate. If the lies were significant and undermined their shared goal, then maybe he's justified. If he was controlling her health choices, that's his fault. But since the fianc\u00e9e admitted to lying and hiding things, the author might be in the right to be upset. But maybe he should have addressed it without immediate eviction. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because the lies were about their mutual health goals, which is a serious breach of trust.\n"
