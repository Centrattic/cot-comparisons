It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e lying about not going to the gym and not eating healthily, which led the author to kick her out and consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and his fianc\u00e9e had a mutual agreement to lose weight after a health scare. The author changed his habits, lost weight, and supported the fianc\u00e9e. However, the fianc\u00e9e wasn't actually following through, hiding the truth for a year. The author discovered she was lying, which caused him to act out in anger.\n\nThe author's actions: He confronted her after finding out the truth, got angry, kicked her out, and is considering a breakup. He's defensive about being controlling. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling him controlling and a monster. The author is hurt because the agreement they both agreed on wasn't honored, leading to a loss of trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, lying is a big deal. If both parties agreed to work towards health goals, then one party deceiving the other breaks that trust. The author's reaction is understandable given the betrayal. However, his response of kicking her out and breaking up might be seen as extreme. But considering the duration of the lie and the impact on their relationship, maybe not. The key points here are the deception and the breach of trust. The author had every reason to be upset. While yelling and kicking her out might be impulsive, the core issue is her dishonesty. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about being lied to. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
