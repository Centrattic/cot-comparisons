It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe person shares that their fianc\u00e9 lied about not losing weight, and they kicked her out and plan to break up. The key points are that they both agreed to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9 gained weight. The author found out she stopped going to the gym and was eating out, hiding junk food. The author confronted her, got angry, kicked her out, and now is considering breaking up.\n\nThe writer is wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the fianc\u00e9's actions. She lied about her gym attendance, eating habits, and hid food. She was dishonest over a year, which is a serious breach of trust. The author tried to support her, gave her the benefit of the doubt, and cooked healthy meals. But she manipulated the situation, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author's reaction: confronting her, kicking her out, planning to break up. The question is whether the author overreacted. The author was in a committed relationship, and trust is fundamental. The fianc\u00e9's lies about health, which was a mutual goal they agreed on, especially after a health scare. The lies are significant and could affect both their health.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's dishonesty led to a betrayal of trust. The author took a stand, which could be seen as justified given the circumstances. However, the method\u2014kicking out of the apartment they pay for\u2014might be harsh. But considering the context of lying for a year and undermining mutual health goals, maybe the reaction is proportionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have considered other options, like couples counseling, or setting boundaries without breaking up. But the situation had been building for a year. The fianc\u00e9 also accused the author of being controlling, which might be a manipulation tactic. The author's actions could be seen as self-respecting, choosing to end a relationship with someone who lied repeatedly.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the fianc\u00e9's actions are clearly wrong. The author's response is a reaction to that betrayal. While breaking up is a big step, it's a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end a relationship where trust has been broken.\n"
