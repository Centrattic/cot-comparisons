It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, the backstory: both he and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight for health reasons after his dad's heart attack. He lost 110 pounds, while she gained 60. He believed her excuses about water weight and thyroid issues until he found out she hadn't been going to the gym and was eating out twice a day. He confronted her, she got defensive, and he kicked her out. Now he's questioning if he's being controlling.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. They agreed on a mutual goal. She lied about her actions, which is a breach of trust. He felt deceived because she wasn't following through. He confronted her, which is reasonable when trust is broken. The problem is, he took it to the extreme by kicking her out and planning a breakup. But the lies and dishonesty might be the root cause here. However, his reaction could be seen as harsh. Did he give her a chance to explain without confrontation? Or was his anger justified because the lies were about a critical health matter they both agreed on?\n\nAlso, she's blaming him for being controlling. Maybe he was being overbearing, but they had a mutual agreement. It depends on how he approached it. If he was pushing her to change instead of supporting her, that could be an issue. But since she was hiding junk food and not eating healthy, maybe he had valid concerns.\n\nThe key points are deception and trust. She lied for a year, which is a big deal. His reaction might be over the top, but the lies might have justified it. However, breaking up over this could be extreme unless there were previous issues. But since they were planning a healthy life together, her dishonesty might have destroyed that foundation. So maybe he's not in the wrong for breaking up, but his anger and immediate action could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, is he in the wrong? The answer might be no because she was lying about something they both committed to. However, the way he handled it (kicking her out, not giving her a chance to address the issues) could be problematic. But the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the lies were the main issue. Since they agreed on the goal and she lied about her efforts, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
