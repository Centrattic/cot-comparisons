It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their story. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight together after the author's father had a heart attack. They both committed to changing their habits\u2014eating healthier, going to the gym daily. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. The author discovered that she had been lying about going to the gym and not eating junk food. She stopped going to the gym in April, ate out a lot, and hid junk food. The author confronted her, got angry, kicked her out, and is considering breaking up. The fianc\u00e9e and her family are calling the author controlling. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are mutual agreement to lose weight, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty, and the author's reaction. Let's break it down.\n\nThey both agreed on the health goals. The author made changes and succeeded. The fianc\u00e9e didn't follow through and lied about it. The lies were about her own actions, not just minor things. She misrepresented her exercise routine and eating habits, which were central to their mutual goal. The author found out through a third party (the gym owner) that she wasn't attending, which led to confrontation.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's defense seems to be that the author was controlling. But the author had made meals and encouraged healthy habits. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's deception. Lying about such a significant personal commitment could be a breach of trust. The author's anger is a reaction to the lies, not necessarily the weight loss issue itself.\n\nBut wait, did the author have the right to kick her out and break up? The argument here is about control. The author might be overreacting by breaking up, but the lies are a major betrayal. In relationships, honesty is crucial. If both agreed on a goal, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty could indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship's shared goals. However, the author's method of dealing with it\u2014kicking her out after confrontation\u2014might be harsh, but the root cause is the lies.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's family calling the author controlling is a red herring. The author was part of a mutual agreement; the control aspect is questionable. The author was supporting healthy habits, not forcing the fianc\u00e9e. The lies and deceit are on the fianc\u00e9e's part. The author's anger is justified because of the betrayal, not the weight loss itself. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lies and planning to break up. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty, not the author's control.\n"
