It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, and the author is considering breaking up. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that both they and their fianc\u00e9 decided to change their lifestyles in 2018 after a health scare. They made a mutual decision to lose weight. The author followed through, losing 110 pounds, and made significant changes like cooking healthy meals and going to the gym daily. However, the fianc\u00e9 didn't lose any weight and actually gained 60 pounds. The author found out later that the fianc\u00e9 had been lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, instead eating out and hiding junk food. The author confronted her, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the facts: the fianc\u00e9 lied for a whole year about not meeting their agreed-upon health goals. She also blamed the author for being controlling, even though the author was following through on their mutual decision. The author had the right to be upset because there was a breach of trust. They made a commitment together, and she didn't honor it, hiding her actions. The author's reaction was based on discovering dishonesty and betrayal, which can be a valid reason for ending a relationship. However, the author did kick her out immediately without perhaps giving her a chance to address the issue or seek help. But given the duration of the lies and the impact on their shared goals, the author's decision might be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach could be seen as harsh. Maybe they should have tried to address the problem earlier or offered support instead of confrontation. But the fianc\u00e9's lies and deceit over a year might have been beyond repair. The author's health goals were important, and the fianc\u00e9's actions undermined their trust and commitment.\n\nSo, considering the mutual agreement to change, the breach of trust, and the defensive behavior from the fianc\u00e9, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The lies and deceit are significant factors. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
