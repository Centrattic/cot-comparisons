It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking his fianc\u00e9e out, and planning to break up because she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both he and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight together after his dad's heart attack. He lost 110 pounds, but she gained weight and was lying about it. He found out she wasn't going to the gym and was eating out a lot. He confronted her, she denied it at first, and now he's kicked her out and wants to break up.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, the fianc\u00e9e lied about her actions. She wasn't honest about her gym attendance and eating habits. That's a problem because trust is crucial in a relationship. The author trusted her and supported her, giving the benefit of the doubt when she had excuses. But she was deceitful, which led to his anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering breaking up, which is a big step. He kicked her out of the apartment he pays for, which might be harsh. But given the circumstances, he had valid reasons. She violated their agreement and lied repeatedly. His reaction is a response to betrayal. However, maybe he should have tried to address the issues without immediately breaking up. But the texts from her family calling him controlling and a monster could be their opinion, not necessarily the truth.\n\nIs he being controlling? The fianc\u00e9e claims he forced her to lose weight. But they both agreed on the goal. If he was cooking for both and they had mutual plans, maybe it's about shared goals. But if he was pressuring her and she felt controlled, that's a different angle. However, the core issue is her dishonesty. She broke the trust he had in her.\n\nSo, in terms of wrongdoings, the fianc\u00e9e is clearly at fault for lying. The author's reaction is a result of her actions. He's hurt and angry, but is he in the wrong? He has the right to be upset and decide to end the relationship if he feels the trust is broken. Breaking up is a personal choice, but the main wrong here is from her. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
