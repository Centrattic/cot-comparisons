It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, and the author kicked her out and plans to break up. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple had a mutual agreement to lose weight after a health scare. The author lost weight, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't. She was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy. The author discovered this and reacted by kicking her out. Now, the fianc\u00e9 and her family are calling the author controlling. The author is conflicted about whether he's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: mutual agreement to lose weight, deceit by the fianc\u00e9, author's reaction, and the fianc\u00e9's response. The author's actions are based on betrayal after a mutual commitment. The fianc\u00e9's lies could be seen as breaking trust. The author's anger is a response to being lied to for a year. However, the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and threatening to break up\u2014might be seen as harsh, but maybe justified given the deceit.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author did confront the fianc\u00e9 and found out she was lying. The author had every right to be upset about the betrayal, especially since it's about their health. However, the author's approach could be considered controlling if they were pressuring her. But since it was mutual, maybe not. The fianc\u00e9 is now blaming the author for her own choices. The author's actions might be justified as a response to the lies and betrayal. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No). But I need to check if the reaction is proportionate. Kicking someone out of the apartment they pay for might be extreme, but given the circumstances, it's a valid reaction. Also, the author is giving her time to think and planning to break up, which is their right. The fianc\u00e9's lies and the author's reaction are both factors. The author isn't controlling if the initial agreement was mutual. The fianc\u00e9's deceit is the main issue here. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
