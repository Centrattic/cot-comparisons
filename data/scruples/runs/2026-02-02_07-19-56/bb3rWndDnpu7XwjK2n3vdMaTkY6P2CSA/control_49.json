It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight. The author and their fianc\u00e9 both decided to get healthier after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9 gained weight instead. The author found out she wasn't going to the gym and was eating junk food, which she hid. The author kicked her out and is considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple agreed to change their habits for health reasons. The author supported the fianc\u00e9, cooked healthy meals, and trusted her when she said she was going to the gym. The fianc\u00e9 lied about her gym attendance, eating habits, and even blamed the author for being controlling. The author felt betrayed because they had a mutual goal, and the fianc\u00e9's actions went against that. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and kicking her out. The fianc\u00e9 is now contacting the author, calling him controlling. The question is whether the author is wrong for reacting this way.\n\nOn one hand, the author had every right to be upset about being lied to, especially since they were working towards a shared health goal. The lies and deceit could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a reaction to the betrayal, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was too controlling. If the fianc\u00e9 felt forced to lose weight, that could be an issue. But the original story says they both agreed to change for their own health. The author wasn't forcing her in a controlling way initially; they were working together. The problem was the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty and going against their agreement.\n\nThe author's anger and decision to break up stem from the lies and breaking the mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9's response is to accuse the author of controlling behavior, but the author was within their rights to want to maintain the health goals they both set. The author's actions were a response to betrayal, not just control. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's dishonesty and breaking the trust they both built is the main issue. The author's reaction, while harsh, is a consequence of the fianc\u00e9's actions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
