It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight. The author and their fianc\u00e9 decided together in 2018 to get healthier, with the author losing 110 pounds. The fianc\u00e9, however, gained weight and lied about going to the gym and eating healthy. The author found out through the gym owner that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't going to the gym and was eating out a lot. After confronting her, the author kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, both agreed to the health plan. The author made efforts, lost weight, and supported the fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through, lied about gym visits, and ate unhealthy. The author discovered this after a year, confronted her, and she became defensive. The author felt lied to and betrayed, leading to the breakup.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were acting on trust and mutual goals. The fianc\u00e9's deception about such a major commitment (health) is a big deal. The author's reaction might be seen as justified given the betrayal. However, some might argue that pushing someone to lose weight can be controlling. But in this case, they both agreed on the health goals. The fianc\u00e9's lies and dishonesty are on her. The author's anger and decision to break up could be seen as a response to being lied to for a year, which is a valid reaction. The fianc\u00e9's claims about being controlled might be a way to deflect responsibility for her own actions. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of kicking her out immediately, maybe communication could have been better. But the situation shows a pattern of lying and not following through, which the author discovered after a long time. The fianc\u00e9's family calling the author a monster adds to the emotional complexity. \n\nConsidering all that, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty and lack of effort. The author's response, while harsh, seems to stem from being misled. So the author is not in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9 broke trust and didn't meet their agreed-upon commitments. The author had the right to be upset and take action to protect their own well-being.\n"
