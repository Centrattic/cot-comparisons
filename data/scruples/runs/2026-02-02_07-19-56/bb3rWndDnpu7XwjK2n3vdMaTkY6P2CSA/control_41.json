It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and breaking up with his fianc\u00e9 after finding out she lied about her weight loss efforts. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They both agreed in 2018 to lose weight for health reasons, especially after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9 gained weight. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, instead she was eating out and hiding junk food. He kicked her out and plans to break up. She's calling him controlling now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: mutual agreement to change lifestyles, one person followed through, the other didn't and lied about it. The author is upset about the betrayal and the health risks. The fianc\u00e9 is defensive and accuses him of controlling behavior.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had a mutual goal. The fianc\u00e9 didn't meet her end of the bargain and lied. The author had a legitimate reason to be upset because it's about their health and trust. The author didn't force her to lose weight, they agreed together. The lies and deception are on her side. The author's reaction is a response to betrayal, not just controlling behavior. While his actions (kicking her out) might be harsh, the underlying issue is her dishonesty. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
