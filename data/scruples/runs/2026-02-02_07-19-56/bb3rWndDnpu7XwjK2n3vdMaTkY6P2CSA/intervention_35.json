It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who lied about not losing weight, the author kicked her out, and wants to break up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about the reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple made a mutual decision to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight and lied about her gym attendance and eating habits. The author found out through the gym owner that she hadn't been going, and she was hiding junk food. The author confronted her, got angry, kicked her out, and now is considering a breakup. \n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement on the health goals, the fianc\u00e9e's deceit (lying about gym attendance and eating habits), and the author's reaction. The author's actions seem to stem from betrayal after a commitment to work on their health together. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as overreacting if the weight loss was a joint decision but the fianc\u00e9e chose not to participate, even if she lied. If the author was pressuring the fianc\u00e9e to lose weight, that could be problematic. However, the story says they both agreed on the changes. The fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty might have broken trust, especially if they were on a path together. Kicking someone out of the apartment can be seen as extreme, but if the lies were significant and the trust was broken, it might be a reasonable response.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's claims that the author was controlling and that the weight loss is part of the author's identity might be a defense mechanism. However, the author's actions after discovering the lies (confrontation, kicking her out, considering breakup) are reactions to deceit. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author was being controlling from the start, maybe. But the story says they both agreed. The lies and deceit from the fianc\u00e9e are the main issue here. The author had the right to be upset and take steps to address the betrayal. However, the immediate reaction of kicking someone out and breaking up might be harsh, but given the context of a year-long deception, it might be justified. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author's actions are a response to a breach of trust after a mutual agreement, which is understandable. The deceit is significant, and the author's reaction, while severe, is a consequence of that deceit.\n"
