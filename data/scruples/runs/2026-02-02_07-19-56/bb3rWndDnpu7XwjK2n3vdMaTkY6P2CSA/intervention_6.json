It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss and gym attendance. \n\nFirst, the couple decided together to lose weight. The author lost a significant amount, while the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she had been lying about attending the gym, eating out, and hiding junk food. She also accused him of being controlling and changing who he is. He kicked her out and wants to break up.\n\nNow, considering the facts: they made a mutual agreement to improve their health. The fianc\u00e9e didn't meet her goals and lied about her efforts. The author tried to encourage her, gave her the benefit of the doubt, but eventually discovered the deception. His reaction of anger and breaking up seems like a response to betrayal, especially since the health commitment was important to both.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e did lie and didn't follow through on their agreement. The author has a right to be upset about the betrayal of trust. However, the way he kicked her out and plans to break up might be seen as extreme. But given the context of a shared goal and her dishonesty, it's a reaction to her actions. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's accusations of him being controlling might be a defense mechanism. But the original agreement was mutual, so her actions went against their shared commitment. The author's anger and decision to break up could be seen as justified given the betrayal and broken trust. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's deception and broken commitments were significant, and the author's reaction stems from those actions.\n"
