It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author and their fianc\u00e9e's weight loss journey. They both decided to get healthier after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e ended up gaining weight. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym, eating out, and hiding junk food. He kicked her out and wants to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to be concerned about their health, especially after a family health scare. They set a mutual goal, so it's understandable they wanted to support each other. The fianc\u00e9e not losing weight and lying about her efforts could be a problem. But is the author being controlling?\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author mentions they both agreed on the health goals. However, if the fianc\u00e9e felt forced or controlled, that's an issue. The author cooked meals for both, which might have been helpful, but if it turned into restricting her autonomy, that's a problem. Also, the author paid for the gym membership, which the fianc\u00e9e wasn't using, so there's a financial aspect here. \n\nWhen the author discovered the lies, their reaction was to kick her out. That seems extreme, but maybe not if the lies were about something they considered important. The fianc\u00e9e's behavior of hiding food and lying could erode trust. The author's anger and decision to break up might be seen as a response to broken trust rather than just controlling behavior.\n\nBut maybe the author overstepped by being too strict. The fianc\u00e9e felt forced, and the author's actions (like cooking all meals) could be seen as controlling. However, since they agreed on the goals initially, it's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is the lies and betrayal of trust. The author had the right to be upset about being lied to, especially for a whole year. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault because the fianc\u00e9e didn't honor their agreement and lied repeatedly. The author's response, while harsh, might be justified given the level of deception. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they both agreed to the health goals, the author's actions might be seen as within their rights. The fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty is the main issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
