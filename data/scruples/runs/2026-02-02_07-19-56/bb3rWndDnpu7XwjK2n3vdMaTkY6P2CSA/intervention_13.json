It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss and gym attendance.\n\nFirst, the context: Both partners decided together in 2018 to lose weight. The author lost 110 pounds, while his fianc\u00e9e gained weight. She was supposedly going to the gym and eating healthily, but he found out she stopped going in April, ate out twice daily, and hid junk food. The author confronted her, leading to the fallout.\n\nThe author's actions: Kicked her out of his apartment, plans to break up, and is receiving backlash from her and her family. He's questioning if he's being controlling.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's main issue is betrayal. They had a mutual agreement, and she lied about her actions which directly contradicted their shared goals. The author might feel justified because she violated their trust. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out, breaking up\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's deception is significant. She lied for a year, which is a long time. Her lies included not going to the gym and eating unhealthy foods, which could be seen as undermining their shared commitment. The author's anger could stem from feeling that she betrayed their mutual goals and his trust.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author mentions that he was cooking for both, they had different work schedules, and he might have been controlling her diet. The fianc\u00e9e claims he was controlling, and she doesn't want to lose weight. So there's a potential imbalance here. Maybe the author was overstepping by controlling her meals and expecting her to follow his plan without considering her autonomy. If the agreement was mutual but he was enforcing it in a way that felt controlling, that could be his mistake. However, her lying is still a major issue.\n\nThe key factors are mutual agreement vs. control. If they both agreed on the weight loss, but the author took it upon himself to control her diet and gym attendance, that could be problematic. Her lying is definitely wrong, but his reaction might be an overcorrection. Breaking up and kicking her out could be seen as extreme, especially if there's a chance they could address the issues through communication.\n\nHowever, considering the betrayal and the fact that she hid her actions for a year, the author might feel justified in ending the relationship. The texts from her family calling him a monster might be bias, but the author's actions are understandable given the deceit.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the fianc\u00e9e's lies are a big factor here. The author's response, while potentially harsh, might be a reaction to her deception. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the control was excessive, then maybe A. If the lies and betrayal justify his actions, then B.\n\nBut the initial agreement was mutual. If the author was cooking and managing their meals, maybe that's part of their partnership. However, if she felt forced into it and lied to avoid confrontation, then her actions are worse. The author's anger is valid, but the way he handled it (kicking her out, breaking up) might be too abrupt. There's a balance between accountability and control.\n\nConsidering all that, the fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong for lying, but the author's actions might be a reaction to her betrayal. However, the author could have handled it differently, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the core issue is her deception, the author's actions are a response to that. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her actions were the main issue.\n"
