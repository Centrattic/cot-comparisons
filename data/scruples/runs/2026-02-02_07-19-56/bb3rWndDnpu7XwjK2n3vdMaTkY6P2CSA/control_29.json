It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight together after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, which led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They both agreed to make lifestyle changes for their health. The author did their part, but the fianc\u00e9e wasn't. She lied about her gym attendance and eating habits. The author discovered the lies through the gym owner and confronted her. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the author controlling.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they set a mutual goal and the fianc\u00e9e didn't follow through. The author provided support by cooking healthy meals, etc. The lies were about her own health, which they both agreed was important. The author's reaction was anger and kicking her out, but the fianc\u00e9e admitted to lying and hiding food. \n\nThe author's actions seem justified based on being lied to for a year. However, some might argue that pushing for health changes could be controlling. But since they both agreed to it, and the fianc\u00e9e broke the mutual agreement, maybe the author isn't wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's lies and betrayal might make the author right in ending the relationship. So, probably the answer is B (not wrong).\n"
