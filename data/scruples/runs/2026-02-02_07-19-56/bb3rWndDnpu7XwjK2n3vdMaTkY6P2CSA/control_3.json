It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out their fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up because she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym. \n\nFirst, the context: Both partners decided together to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds while cooking healthy meals and going to the gym. The fianc\u00e9e gained 60 pounds, stopped going to the gym in April, and lied about it. The author found out through the gym owner, confronted her, and she admitted to eating out, not exercising, hiding junk food, and blaming the author for being controlling. The author kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author and fianc\u00e9e agreed on the health goals. The fianc\u00e9e broke the trust by lying, which is a serious issue. The author had a valid reason for anger because the lies were about a shared goal they both committed to. The author provided support (cooking, etc.), but the fianc\u00e9e didn't follow through and hid her actions. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a strong step but might be seen as justified given the betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was too controlling, especially if the fianc\u00e9e felt pressured. However, the story states they agreed together, and the author gave her the benefit of the doubt. The fianc\u00e9e's actions of lying and hiding food are more deceptive. The author's response was after finding out the truth, which could be seen as a reasonable reaction to being lied to about something important they both committed to.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e violated their agreement and lied repeatedly. The author acted after discovering the deception, which is a valid response to broken trust. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
