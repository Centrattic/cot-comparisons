It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym.\n\nFirst, they set the context: both decided to lose weight after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained weight. She lied about going to the gym and eating healthy, hiding junk food. The author found out through the gym owner that she was a no-show. Confrontation led to her admitting lies and blaming the author for being controlling. The author kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. \n\nOn one hand, the author and fianc\u00e9e agreed on a health plan. The fianc\u00e9e's lies about her actions could be seen as deceitful, especially since it's a shared goal. The author's reaction might be justified if he felt betrayed. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nPotential issues: The author might have been overly controlling by cooking every meal and monitoring her habits. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were deceptive, but the author's response\u2014kicking her out and planning a breakup\u2014might be seen as extreme. However, after a year of lies and betrayal of trust, some might argue the author is justified in ending the relationship. \n\nBut the author's anger and immediate reaction could be seen as harsh. Did he give her a chance to explain or address the issues before reacting? Also, controlling behavior might contribute to the problem. However, the fianc\u00e9e's lies and betrayal are significant. \n\nConsidering both sides, the key points are mutual agreement on health goals, her deceit, and the author's response. While the author's actions might be understandable given the betrayal, whether he's in the wrong depends on the severity of his reaction versus her deceit. Since the fianc\u00e9e lied for a year and the author felt betrayed, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I need to weigh the control aspect. If he was overstepping by controlling her diet and gym attendance, that could be his fault. However, the story mentions they agreed to change their habits together. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's controlling behavior might be part of the problem, the fianc\u00e9e's lies and deceit are significant. The author's reaction is a response to that betrayal. However, the immediate breakup and kicking her out might be seen as harsh. But given the context of a shared goal and the lies, the author's actions could be justified. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
