It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about the author's fianc\u00e9e lying about her weight loss efforts. They had both agreed to change their lifestyles after his father's heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e actually gained weight and wasn't going to the gym. He found out through the gym owner that she was lying, and now he's kicked her out and planning to break up. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual agreement on health goals, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty, and the author's reaction. The author set clear boundaries by creating a meal plan and going to the gym daily. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, didn't follow through. She lied about her gym attendance and eating habits, which is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author confronted her after finding out the truth from a third party. His anger is understandable given the betrayal. However, kicking her out of the apartment he pays for might be a harsh reaction. But considering the deceit and the impact on their relationship, it's a response to the lies. The fianc\u00e9e is now blaming him for controlling her, but the author's actions were based on mutual goals they agreed upon. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's lies and dishonesty are significant. The author had every right to feel betrayed. While the response of kicking her out could be seen as extreme, the context of ongoing lies and the fact that they were in a committed relationship where honesty is crucial supports his actions. The author isn't controlling; he was following a mutual plan and found out his partner was deceitful.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty is the main issue, and the author acted based on discovering the truth after repeated lies.\n"
