It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided to lose weight together in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't lose any and actually gained weight. He found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating unhealthy food, which led to him kicking her out and considering a breakup. The key points here are: mutual agreement to change, her deception, his reaction.\n\nFirst, the couple had a mutual decision to change their lifestyles. That suggests that the goal was something they both agreed on. But then the fianc\u00e9e stopped going to the gym without telling him, lied about her habits, and now accuses him of being controlling. The author is upset because he felt betrayed after working hard and trusting her. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, trust is crucial. If she lied repeatedly about something they both agreed on, that's a breach of trust. However, the author might be in the wrong if he was pressuring her or being controlling from the start. But according to the story, they made the decision together. He cooked for both of them, which could be seen as supportive, but maybe overstepping if she felt it was intrusive. \n\nHer lying is a major issue. If she wasn't following through and hiding her actions, that's dishonest. The author's reaction of kicking her out and considering a breakup is a strong move, but perhaps justified if trust is broken. However, is he being controlling by not allowing her autonomy? The fianc\u00e9e claims he forced her to lose weight, but if it was a mutual agreement, maybe she later felt pressured. \n\nThe key is whether the author crossed a line. If he was supportive and she was deceptive, then his anger might be justified. On the other hand, if he was overbearing in his approach, like controlling her food or activities, that could be a problem. But according to the post, he was cooking for them, which is a form of support, and she was the one hiding junk food. \n\nIn conclusion, the fianc\u00e9e's lies and dishonesty are significant. The author's reaction is based on betrayal of trust, which is a valid reason for anger. Unless the author was actively controlling her in a harmful way (which the post doesn't clearly indicate), he's not in the wrong. The answer is B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
