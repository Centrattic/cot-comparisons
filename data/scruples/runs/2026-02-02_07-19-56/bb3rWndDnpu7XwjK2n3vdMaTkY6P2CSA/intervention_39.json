It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong after getting angry, kicking out their partner, and planning to break up because they lied about not losing weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: Both the author and their fianc\u00e9 decided to lose weight together in 2018 after a health scare. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9 actually gained weight. The author found out that the fianc\u00e9 had been lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, instead eating out and hiding junk food. The author confronted her, got angry, kicked her out, and is planning to break up. The fianc\u00e9 is now calling the author controlling and a monster, with her family also texting similar messages. The author is conflicted about whether they are in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the situation from both perspectives. The author's side: They had a shared goal of improving health, which was a mutual agreement. When the fianc\u00e9 lied about her habits, leading to weight gain, the author felt betrayed. They took action by confronting her, which led to the current situation. The author might argue that honesty was crucial to their shared goal, and the lies broke trust.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: She might feel that the author was pressuring her into losing weight, making her feel controlled. The fact that she started to avoid the gym and eat unhealthy could be due to stress or personal issues, and her defensiveness about the weight gain (attributing it to water weight or thyroid issues) might indicate underlying problems. When confronted, the author's reaction of kicking her out might seem harsh, especially if the fianc\u00e9 felt backed into a corner and responded with defensive accusations.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is fundamental. If one partner lied about something as significant as their health and habits that were part of a mutual agreement, that's a breach of trust. However, the way the author handled the confrontation\u2014getting angry, kicking her out immediately\u2014might be seen as an overreaction. The author might have considered other ways to address the issue, like seeking couples counseling instead of breaking up. The fianc\u00e9's claims of being controlled could be valid if the author was overly prescriptive about her diet and exercise, even if it was for health reasons. However, if the agreement was mutual, the fianc\u00e9 choosing to lie and not follow through is a problem.\n\nThe author's intention was to support a healthier lifestyle for both of them. The fianc\u00e9's actions undermined that trust. But the immediate reaction of breaking up and kicking her out, without perhaps giving her an opportunity to address the issues, could be seen as harsh. The fact that the author is now considering breaking up might be justified if they feel the trust is irreparably broken, but the method of handling it could be questioned.\n\nIn terms of control, if the author was managing the meals and controlling the environment to the point it made the fianc\u00e9 secretive, that could contribute to the situation. However, the fianc\u00e9's lies and deceit are also a major factor. The author's anger is understandable given the betrayal, but the response needs to be measured. The question is whether the author's actions (breaking up) are justified given the breach of trust, or if they overstepped by being too controlling.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's main wrongdoing might be not addressing the issue in a more constructive way before resorting to breaking up, but the fianc\u00e9's lies and dishonesty are significant. It's a complex situation where both parties have some faults. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, while the fianc\u00e9's side has defensive claims. Based on the information given, the author's actions are a reaction to the lies, but their response might be seen as harsh. However, given the breach of trust, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. I'm leaning towards the answer being B (author not in the wrong) because the key issue is the fianc\u00e9's deceit, but the author's handling could be improved. Alternatively, if the author was too controlling, then A. But the main fault is the fianc\u00e9's lies. So maybe B.\n"
