It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9e lied about not exercising and eating unhealthy, leading the author to kick her out and plan a breakup. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple decided together in 2018 to lose weight, which the author took seriously and lost 110 pounds. The fianc\u00e9e, however, didn't lose weight and gained 60 pounds. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, which led to confrontation and her being kicked out. The author is now considering breaking up, feeling betrayed.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this objectively. The author and fianc\u00e9e made a mutual decision to improve their health. The author followed through, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't, and lied about it. The author's actions\u2014confronting, kicking her out\u2014seem like a response to betrayal. However, relationships require trust, and the author might be overreacting by breaking up, even if the lies were significant.\n\nBut wait, the author paid for the apartment she was kicked out of. Maybe that's a point. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's family is calling the author controlling. Is the author being controlling by holding her accountable to their mutual goal? Or is the fianc\u00e9e's lying the bigger issue here?\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions of lying about going to the gym and hiding junk food are deceptive. The author's anger might be justified because they trusted each other to work on their health. However, breaking up immediately after confrontation might be too harsh. The question is whether the author's reaction is proportionate to the betrayal.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because relationships involve compromise and support, and maybe they should have addressed the issue earlier instead of letting it build up. Also, controlling behavior could be a red flag. But the fianc\u00e9e's lies about health matters, which are crucial for the author's own mental state, might be a deal-breaker.\n\nI need to weigh the mutual agreement versus individual autonomy. The author might have been too controlling by enforcing their health goals on the fianc\u00e9e, which she found oppressive. However, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty is a breach of trust. It's a tough call. The author's actions could be seen as a justified response to deceit, but the method (kicking out, planning a breakup) might be too extreme. Alternatively, the author could have handled it differently, like seeking counseling instead of immediate punishment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether both parties contributed. The author and fianc\u00e9e agreed on the goal, but the author's approach might have been controlling. However, the fianc\u00e9e's lying and deception are also significant. The author's reaction is understandable but perhaps not the best approach. So, the answer might be a mix. But according to the options, it's either A or B. \n\nIf I lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), it's because their response could be seen as controlling and overreacting. But if it's B (not in the wrong), then the fianc\u00e9e's deceit justifies their actions. The key here is the mutual agreement. If they both agreed to work on health, but the fianc\u00e9e lied to avoid accountability, the author's anger is justified. However, breaking up might be too hasty. But given the betrayal of trust, maybe it's understandable. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the trust was broken. However, maybe the response is too harsh. But the options are A or B. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm considering both sides, I need to decide. In AITA, often if one person's actions are deceitful and the other reacts strongly, the reaction is sometimes seen as justified. So maybe the answer is B. But I'm not sure. Wait, the author paid for the apartment, kicked her out. Maybe that's a point against the author. Also, controlling behavior could be an issue. So maybe A is correct. But the deceit is significant. I'm a bit conflicted. The answer might depend on cultural norms and societal expectations around health goals in relationships. If the author's actions are seen as controlling, then A. If the deceit is the main issue, then B. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is partially in the wrong for being controlling, but the fianc\u00e9e's deceit is also problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the mutual agreement, the author might not be entirely at fault. But their reaction is extreme. Hmm. I think the answer is A because the author's response was disproportionate. They could have handled it without breaking up. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
