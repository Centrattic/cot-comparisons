It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight. The author and their fianc\u00e9 made a mutual decision to lose weight after his dad's heart attack. The author worked hard, lost 110 pounds, and believed they were both on track. But the fianc\u00e9 didn't lose weight, gained some, and lied about going to the gym. The author found out through the gym owner that she had stopped going, and she was eating out a lot and hiding junk food. The author kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They wanted to make a healthy lifestyle change together, which is a common goal in relationships. But the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 lied for a whole year about her gym attendance and eating habits. That's a big issue because trust is crucial in any relationship. The fianc\u00e9's deception could be seen as a betrayal, especially since they had agreed on this together. \n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out and plan a breakup. But was that overreacting? Well, the author had invested emotionally and physically into this shared goal. Finding out that the fianc\u00e9 lied about such a significant matter might make the author feel betrayed. However, before breaking up, did the author try to resolve the issue through communication? The author says they talked about it, but the fianc\u00e9 got defensive. The author gave her the benefit of the doubt out of love and trust. When the truth came out, the author felt justified in ending things because the trust was broken.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as controlling if they imposed their weight loss goals on the fianc\u00e9 without respecting her autonomy. The fianc\u00e9 claims the author forced her to lose weight, which could indicate that the author was being overbearing. However, the initial agreement was mutual. The problem arises when the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through and lied about it. The author's anger and decision to break up could be a reaction to deceit rather than control, but the line between accountability and control is thin here.\n\nAlso, the author paid for the apartment, so when they kicked her out, that's a significant action. The fianc\u00e9 is now staying at her parents and trying to reach out, but the author is cutting off contact. The author's family is also involved, calling them controlling. So there's a social aspect here where others are influencing the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are the mutual agreement, the deception, and the reaction. The author didn't force the fianc\u00e9 to lose weight initially; it was a mutual decision. The lying and hiding food might be more about the fianc\u00e9's actions. The author's reaction could be seen as a result of broken trust. However, the way they handled the breakup might be harsh. Maybe there was room for another discussion or working through the issue instead of immediate breakups. But given the level of deceit and the impact on the author's health goals, it's understandable they wanted to end it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely at fault. The fianc\u00e9's lies and deceit are a major factor. The author's actions are a response to that. However, the author's approach could have been more constructive. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's actions were deceitful and the author acted based on that.\n"
