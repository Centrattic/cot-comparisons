It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking their fianc\u00e9e out, and planning to break up after discovering she lied about her weight loss and gym attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author and their fianc\u00e9e made a mutual decision to lose weight in 2018. The author worked hard, lost 110 pounds, and supported their partner. However, the fianc\u00e9e didn't lose weight and actually gained, leading to the author finding out she lied about going to the gym and not eating junk food. The author felt betrayed, kicked her out, and wants to break up. The fianc\u00e9e is now claiming the author is controlling.\n\nOn one hand, the author had every right to be upset about being lied to, especially since they were both committed to a health journey. Trust is a crucial element in any relationship, and the fianc\u00e9e's deceit could be seen as breaking that trust. The author's reaction might be understandable given the betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be being controlling. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned that the author was pressuring her, and maybe the health plan was more about the author's needs than mutual agreement. The author's decision to kick her out and potentially break up could be seen as a harsh reaction. The fianc\u00e9e's actions (eating out, hiding food) might stem from feeling controlled rather than a lack of commitment.\n\nBut here's the thing: the fianc\u00e9e agreed to the plan and then lied about her actions. That's a betrayal of trust. The author had every right to feel hurt and to take action. However, the method of kicking her out and breaking up might be seen as extreme. But considering the duration of the lies (a year) and the deceit, the author's reaction could be justified.\n\nThe key points are mutual agreement to lose weight, the fianc\u00e9e's deceit, and the author's reaction. The fianc\u00e9e's lies about gym attendance and eating habits are significant. The author had the right to confront her, and while the breakup is a big step, it's a response to betrayal. The author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
