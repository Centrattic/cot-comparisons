It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up because she lied about not losing weight and not going to the gym. \n\nFirst, the situation: Both the author and his fianc\u00e9e decided together to lose weight after the author's father had a heart attack. The author lost a significant amount of weight, but his fianc\u00e9e gained weight. He found out she had been lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, which led him to kick her out and consider a breakup.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9e made a mutual decision to change their lifestyles. The author supported her by cooking meals and trusting her. But she lied about her habits, leading to betrayal. The author's reaction is anger, which led to kicking her out. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The fianc\u00e9e's deceit is a major issue. Lying for a whole year about going to the gym and eating healthily is significant. The author had the right to be upset about being deceived, especially since their health goals were mutual. However, the author's response\u2014kicking her out of the apartment he pays for and planning a breakup\u2014might be seen as harsh. But considering the betrayal, maybe it's a justified reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e accuses the author of being controlling. They did agree on the health goals together, so it's not entirely one-sided control. However, the author's actions might have been too extreme. But given the context of betrayal, it's a complex situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the fianc\u00e9e's lies are the main issue. The author had the right to feel hurt and betrayed. Breaking up is a personal decision, but the initial decision to change lifestyles was mutual. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset by the lies. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
