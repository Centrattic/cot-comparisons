It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the text is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight, leading the author to kick them out and consider a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their fianc\u00e9 decided together to change their health in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9 gained weight. The author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 had been lying about going to the gym and eating healthy, instead eating out and hiding junk food. The fianc\u00e9 claims the author was controlling, and the author feels betrayed, leading to the current conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The author and fianc\u00e9 set mutual goals, so the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty is a problem. Lying about gym attendance and eating habits broke the trust. The author's reaction was anger and kicking them out, which is a strong response. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions were deceitful, which could justify the author's feelings. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author paid for the gym membership, so the fianc\u00e9 not using it is an issue. However, did the author have the right to control the fianc\u00e9's behavior? The fianc\u00e9 might feel pressured, but they agreed to the goals. The author's approach might be controlling, but the fianc\u00e9's lies are a bigger betrayal. \n\nAlso, the author confronted after finding out the truth. The fianc\u00e9's defense that the author is controlling and that losing weight is about changing oneself adds complexity. The author might have overstepped by creating strict rules, but the fianc\u00e9's deceit is a major factor. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 lying repeatedly about health goals is a significant breach. The author's anger and decision to break up are reactions to betrayal. However, the method of confronting and kicking out might be harsh, but given the deceit, it's a possible response. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially for being too controlling, but the fianc\u00e9's lies are the main issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions were a reaction to the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty, the blame might not be solely on the author. But maybe the author could have handled it differently. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions are more blameworthy. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
