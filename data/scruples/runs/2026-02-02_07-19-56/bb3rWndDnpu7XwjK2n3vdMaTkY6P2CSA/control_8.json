It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated because it involves a relationship where both people agreed to lose weight, but one of them lied about her progress. The author is the fianc\u00e9 who lost 110 pounds and is now upset because his fianc\u00e9 gained weight and lied about not going to the gym and eating out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. They both agreed to make health changes in 2018. The author is happy with his progress, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. The key points here are the lies about gym attendance and diet. The author found out through the gym owner that she hadn't been going, which he used to confront her. She responded by being defensive and accusing him of being controlling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's justified in being upset because she lied to him about something they both agreed was important. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and lying about such a significant matter could be a breach of trust. Also, he's taking steps to address his own health, which is a positive thing, and he's concerned about her health too.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was too controlling in his approach. He mentions cooking for both of them and monitoring her habits, which could be seen as overstepping. However, they had made a mutual decision, so it's possible he was trying to support her. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling him controlling might be valid if he was pressuring her too much. But she lied about her behavior, which is a serious issue.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author says he gave her the benefit of the doubt but now feels betrayed. The response to kick her out and plan a breakup is a strong reaction, but it's a result of accumulated frustration. The fianc\u00e9's family is also attacking him, which adds complexity. However, the core issue is her dishonesty and not following through on their shared goal.\n\nI think the main fault lies with the fianc\u00e9 for lying and not being honest about her actions. The author is reacting to betrayal and trying to protect his own health and the integrity of their agreement. While his response might be harsh, the root cause is her deception. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
