It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a fianc\u00e9e who lied about not losing weight, and the author kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his fianc\u00e9e decided together to lose weight for health reasons, especially after his dad's heart attack. They both committed to changing their habits in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9e gained weight instead. She lied about going to the gym, stopped attending, and was eating junk food. The author found out through the gym owner, confronted her, and kicked her out.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is now calling him controlling and making excuses, saying he forced her to lose weight. The author is conflicted because he felt they agreed on the health goals, but she didn't follow through and lied. He's upset about the lies and betrayal.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. I need to determine if his actions (getting mad, kicking her out, planning a breakup) are justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty is a major issue. She made commitments they both agreed upon, then lied about her actions. The author trusted her and supported her, giving her the benefit of the doubt. Her deceit and broken commitments could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger is understandable in that context. However, the author might be overreacting by kicking her out immediately and planning a breakup. But considering the extent of the lies and the fact that they had mutual goals, the betrayal is significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been too controlling if he was forcing her to lose weight against her will. But the situation states that they both agreed on the health goals. The fianc\u00e9e later claimed it was forced, but the author says they agreed. So, if they made a mutual decision, her not following through and lying makes her actions worse. The author's reaction is justified because trust is broken here. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
