It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry, kicking out his fianc\u00e9e, and planning to break up over her lying about weight loss. The situation involves both of them making a mutual decision to lose weight in 2018. The author lost a lot of weight, but his fianc\u00e9e gained weight and lied about her progress. He found out she wasn't going to the gym and was eating out, which he says she hid from him. He kicked her out and wants to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. He says they both agreed on the weight loss plan. The fianc\u00e9e was lying about her gym attendance and eating habits. The author confronted her after finding out through the gym owner, and then kicked her out. The question is whether he's in the wrong for reacting this way.\n\nPossible angles to consider: was the author controlling her too much? Did he have a right to be upset about her lies? The fianc\u00e9e claims he was controlling and that she didn't want to lose weight, but they had agreed on it. If she lied about her participation, that's deceitful. The author's actions (kicking her out, breaking up) are responses to betrayal. However, maybe he overreacted. The key points are mutual agreement on the plan, her dishonesty, and his reaction.\n\nHe mentions he was supportive, gave her the benefit of the doubt, but when confronted with lies, he acted. The fianc\u00e9e's family is now calling him controlling, but the author's actions were based on her deception. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e broke trust. However, some might argue that he could have handled it differently. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether deceit and betrayal justify his reaction. Since the fianc\u00e9e lied and didn't follow through on a mutual agreement, the author's anger and decision to break up might be justified. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
