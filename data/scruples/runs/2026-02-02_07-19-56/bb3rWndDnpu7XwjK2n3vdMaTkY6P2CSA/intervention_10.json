It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about not losing weight. The author and their fianc\u00e9 both decided to lose weight after the author's dad had a heart attack. The author lost 110 pounds, but the fianc\u00e9 gained 60 pounds. She lied about going to the gym and eating healthy. When confronted, she got defensive and accused the author of being controlling. The author kicked her out and plans to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to want to lose weight after their father's health scare. They made a joint decision, which is great, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. Lying about gym attendance and diet is a problem because it shows a lack of honesty and maybe deceit. The author was cooking for both, so the fianc\u00e9 hiding junk food and eating out shows she wasn't committed to the plan they agreed on together. \n\nBut wait, did the author have a right to be upset about the lies? The author trusted the fianc\u00e9, and betrayal of trust is a big deal. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out and plan a breakup. That seems harsh. Maybe the author overreacted? The fianc\u00e9's behavior was dishonest, but breaking up might be a big step. Also, the author was paying for the apartment, so maybe they had the right to ask her to leave if she was lying. \n\nBut another angle: the author might have contributed to the problem by being controlling. They cooked every meal, maybe didn't respect the fianc\u00e9's autonomy. The fianc\u00e9 might have felt pressured, leading her to lie. The author's approach could be too strict, making the fianc\u00e9 act out. So, the author's controlling behavior might have caused some of the issues. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's lies and deceit are significant. The author had a right to be upset about the betrayal. The decision to break up might be justified because trust is crucial in a relationship. But was the author right to kick her out immediately without trying to work through the issues? Maybe they should have communicated more before making such a drastic move. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's response of calling the author a monster and being defensive isn't helpful. But the author's anger and immediate action might have been too harsh. The question is whether the author is wrong for reacting this way. Considering that the fianc\u00e9 lied for a whole year and the author felt betrayed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author was too controlling, then they share some blame. \n\nIt's a tough call. The lies and deceit are on the fianc\u00e9's part, but the author's reaction might be excessive. However, the author's concern for their health and the trust issue is valid. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9 broke trust and the author had a right to be upset. However, the author could have handled it differently. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B.\n"
