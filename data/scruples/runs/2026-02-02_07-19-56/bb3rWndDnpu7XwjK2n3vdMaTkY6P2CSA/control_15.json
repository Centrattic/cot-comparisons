It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e lying about not going to the gym and not following their agreed-upon health plan. The author is angry, kicked her out, and plans to break up. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple both decided to lose weight in 2018. The author lost 110 pounds, while the fianc\u00e9e gained 60. She lied about going to the gym, stopped attending in April but told the author she was going. She also ate out frequently and hid junk food. The author found out through the gym owner. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the author controlling and that losing weight is about changing who he is.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty. They had a mutual agreement to change their lifestyles for health reasons, which was prompted by the author's father's heart attack. The author made significant changes and was supportive, even cooking for both. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, violated their agreement by not participating and lying. \n\nThe author's reaction is anger, leading to kicking her out and considering a breakup. The fianc\u00e9e is now blaming the author for being controlling, which might be a deflection. The author's actions are a response to betrayal and dishonesty. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is whether the author was controlling. The author and fianc\u00e9e had a mutual goal, so it's a joint decision. The author's support (cooking, planning) shows commitment. However, the fianc\u00e9e's lies and non-compliance, especially after the author's health scare, could be seen as breaking trust. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable given the betrayal. Kicking her out might be a reaction to the dishonesty rather than controlling behavior. The fianc\u00e9e's current accusations might be an attempt to shift blame. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to the fianc\u00e9e's deceit. While the author might have overreacted, the core issue is the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty and failure to follow through on a mutual agreement. The author isn't necessarily controlling; they were following through while the fianc\u00e9e wasn't. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
