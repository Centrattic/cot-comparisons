It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user presented a situation where someone is upset because their fianc\u00e9e lied about not losing weight, which led to them kicking her out and planning a breakup. The key points are that they both agreed to change their lifestyles for health reasons, the author lost a significant amount of weight, while the fianc\u00e9e didn't and instead gained weight. The author found out she was lying about going to the gym and eating right, and this led to a confrontation. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the author controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author and fianc\u00e9e had a mutual goal of improving their health, which is a valid and commendable reason. The author made an effort and succeeded, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't follow through. The deception is a big issue here\u2014lying about exercise and eating habits for a whole year. That's a breach of trust. The author felt hurt and betrayed, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction of kicking her out and planning a breakup might be seen as harsh. While the lies are serious, the response could be considered an overreaction. The author might be in a position of power since they pay for the apartment and can decide who lives there. But the fianc\u00e9e's actions contributed to the breakdown of trust. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's claims that the author was being controlling might have some validity if the author was pressuring her in an unhealthy way. However, since they both agreed to the lifestyle changes, it's more about mutual commitment. The author's anger and subsequent actions are a reaction to betrayal, but the question is whether the betrayal justifies the breakup. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a complex situation. The fianc\u00e9e lied and didn't uphold her part of the agreement, which is wrong. The author's response might be justified in terms of self-respect and needing to restore trust. But breaking up over this could be seen as extreme. However, if trust is broken in such a significant way, it's understandable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e's dishonesty was a major breach of trust, and the author had the right to take actions they needed to protect their own well-being. The decision to break up is a personal one, but the author's actions stem from being lied to and having their trust violated. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
