It was almost 100% caused by his weight and it scared me to death. At the time I was pushing 450 pounds and this was a huge wake up call for me. I sat down with my fiance and talked with her about it. She was over 500 at the time and I wanted to get the fears I had for both of ours health's out on the table and talk with her. In the end we both decided for our own sakes we should lose alot of weight. So for 2018 our resolution was to completely change.\n\nI won't lie, this last year was hard. We both changed our eating habits drastically, We both went to the gym every day, And I began cooking every meal to make sure we had good health food. Despite this, I am happier than ever. I lost 110 pound last year and me and my fiance are now on a path to a health life, at least I thought. This is where the problems start. My fiance has not lost any weight. In fact, she gained over 60 pounds over the year. Every time I talked with her about this she has gotten defensive and claimed that it's \"water weight\" or that is's her thyroid or a other medical issue. I've always given her the benefit of the doubt since i loved her and trusted that she wasn't lying to me.\n\nWell, this last week I figured it out. I've gotten really friendly with the owner of the gym \"we\" had been going. While there, she decided to ask me if I wanted to cancel my fiance's membership since she never came. It turns out my fiance stopped coming last April but never told me. Yet, every day she would tell me she was going or was at the gym (our work schedules were different so we planned to go at different times). This made me very suspicious so I confronted her.\n\nIt turns out my fiance has been lying to me about everything. She has been eating out twice a day, not exercising at all, and hiding copious amounts of junk food away to eat while i'm not around. She claims I was being controlling and that she doesn't want to lose weight but I forced her to. She is now also saying that me losing wight is \"wrong\" and that i'm trying to change \"who I am\". I won't lie, I blew up at all of this and kicked her out of the apartment I pay for.\n\nFor the past week she has been staying at her parents and tries to call me everyday. I've gotten a barrage of of texts calling me \"controlling\" and a monster for how I treated her from her family and I honestly just need some advice. I'm hurt by the fact that she lied to me for a whole year about this when we both agree'd that this is what we needed. I'm planning on breaking up with her right now and told her last night that i'm think \"us\" through. Am I in th wrong though? Am I just being controlling?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who lied about her weight loss efforts. The author set up a plan with their fianc\u00e9 to get healthier after the father's heart attack. Both committed to it, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't lose weight and actually gained. The author found out later that she had been lying about going to the gym and eating healthy.\n\nHmm, so the author confronted her, found out she was lying, kicked her out, and planning a breakup. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another opinion. The options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 agreed to the plan, but didn't follow through and lied about it. She even hid food and ate out a lot. The author was cooking healthy meals for both, and trusted her. The lies were a betrayal, especially since health was a mutual goal. The author's reaction might be seen as justified because of the deceit. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, instead of kicking her out immediately, maybe addressing the issue in a calmer way. But given the betrayal and the lies over a year, the author's trust was broken. \n\nBut is the author being controlling? The fianc\u00e9 claims the author forced her to lose weight. The author mentions they both agreed on the plan. So maybe the author isn't controlling, but the fianc\u00e9 felt pressured. However, the author's actions (cooking every meal, tracking gym membership) might be seen as overstepping. But the key here is the lying. The author trusted the fianc\u00e9, who broke that trust. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9 lied and broke a mutual agreement. The author's reaction is understandable, even if harsh. But is the author the one in the wrong? Probably not. The lies and deceit are the main issues here. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). However, maybe the author had other options. But given the situation, the author's actions are a response to betrayal. So I think B is the right choice here.\n"
