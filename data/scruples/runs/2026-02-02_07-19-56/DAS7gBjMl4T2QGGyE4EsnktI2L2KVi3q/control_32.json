They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is visiting family for Christmas, living in a different part of the country. They had plans to spend time shopping and relaxing. A family member needed childcare, but instead of asking the author directly, another relative did. The author said no, then the family member took to Facebook to vent, making posts implying selfishness and affecting her job. The author felt it was their right to say no since they don't live nearby and didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was on vacation, had made plans, and the request was not made directly to them. The family member's reaction was public shaming on Facebook, which seems more about venting than resolving the issue. The author didn't agree to the request, which the family member then took personally. \n\nNow, considering responsibilities within family. In many families, especially when people live far apart, expectations around childcare can vary. The author wasn't asked directly, so maybe there's an expectation that they should have been more available. But on the flip side, the author is not a local, only sees family a couple times a year, and had plans. The family member could have sought other childcare solutions instead of public shaming.\n\nThe author didn't do anything wrong by saying no. They had the right to prioritize their own plans, especially when they were a guest in their own vacation. The family member's response was inconsiderate and possibly overreaching. The author didn't set a precedent before, so declining once doesn't make them selfish. The real issue is the family member's reaction and the expectation of constant availability without prior discussion.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They were reasonable in their refusal and the onus was on the family member to find other childcare options instead of taking it out on the author publicly.\n"
