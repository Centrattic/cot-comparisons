They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who declined to babysit a family member's toddler during their vacation. The key points here are about expectations, communication, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author lives far away from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. They took time off work for a visit. The family member in question needed childcare because her mother-in-law backed out and others were working. She didn't ask the author directly; someone else passed the request. The author said no because they had plans and didn't want to cancel them. Then, the family member got upset, sent messages, and posted on Facebook about it. The author didn't feel obligated and didn't want to set a precedent for being on call for childcare.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they have their own plans, especially since they're only there a few times a year. They also mention that the family member often expects others to be available for childcare, which they don't want to enable. The family member's response was public shaming on Facebook, which is pretty harsh.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't the one who initially asked for help. The request was routed through others, which might not be the best approach. The author had a valid reason to decline, especially since they were on vacation. However, the public Facebook posts might come off as judgmental and could be seen as holding a grudge. But the author's main point is that they didn't feel responsible, especially since they don't live there and have their own plans.\n\nIn terms of social norms, family can have varying expectations. If the family member is used to others helping without being asked directly, maybe she's not setting the right boundaries either. The author's refusal isn't out of selfishness but setting personal boundaries. The family member's reaction, though, seems excessive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to decline, especially given the circumstances. The family member's handling of the situation was inappropriate, but the author's decision to say no isn't something they should be blamed for. The answer should be B.\n"
