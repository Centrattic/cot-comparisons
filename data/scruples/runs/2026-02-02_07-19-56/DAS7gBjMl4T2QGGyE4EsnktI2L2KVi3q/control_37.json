They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author is visiting family from out of town and had made plans with their own time. The family member in question needed childcare last-minute because her mother-in-law bailed and others were working. She didn't ask the author directly but had someone else ask. The author refused, and then the family member took it to Facebook, making it a public issue.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they were on vacation, had their own plans, and didn't feel obligated since they live far away. They didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare. That makes sense because maintaining boundaries is important, especially when you're not in the same area.\n\nOn the other hand, the family member felt abandoned and used social media to vent. That's a bit problematic because public shaming can be hurtful and unproductive. However, the original issue is about whether the author was wrong for declining. \n\nThe author didn't agree to help in the first place. The family member asked through someone else, not directly, which could be seen as a communication issue. The author had the right to say no, especially since they weren't consulted properly and had their own plans. Plus, they mentioned that this family member often expects others to be available for childcare, which adds context about recurring issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for not helping, especially since they didn't commit to it and the request was handled indirectly. The family member's reaction was inappropriate, but the author's refusal is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
