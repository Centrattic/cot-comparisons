They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author lives far from their family and visits a few times a year. During a visit, they had plans to relax and shop. A family member needed childcare, but instead of asking the author directly, someone else did. The author refused, and the family member then vented on Facebook, making the author feel targeted. The author now wonders if they were wrong for not agreeing.\n\nKey points to consider: The author was on vacation, had their own plans, and the request wasn't made directly to them. The family member used intermediaries and then publicly shamed the author. The author also mentions that the family member often expects others to provide childcare without considering their availability.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to set boundaries, especially when they are not in a position where they're obligated (like primary caregivers). Since the author isn't a primary caregiver and lives far away, they might not be expected to drop their own plans. However, some might argue that family obligations require flexibility. \n\nHowever, the family member's response was extreme\u2014public shaming on Facebook instead of seeking alternatives. The author's refusal was direct and clear, and they didn't hide the fact they had plans. The family member's actions (posting, making passive-aggressive comments) seem more problematic than the author's decision to prioritize their own plans. \n\nSo, while some might say the author should have accommodated, others would argue that the family member's reaction is what's truly in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to help, especially if there's a pattern of unreasonable expectations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
