They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation.\n\nThe key points from the story: The author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. They had taken vacation time to spend time with family. A family member needed childcare and asked others first, who declined. Then, the family member tried to get the author to do it by having someone else ask, which the author refused. The family member then posted negative things on Facebook, leading to tension. The author doesn't want to set a precedent where they're expected to provide childcare whenever they visit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of family interactions. The author made their plans known and had already declined when asked via a third party. The family member's approach of using Facebook to vent might be inappropriate, but the main question is whether the author was wrong for refusing.\n\nBoundaries are important here. The author doesn't live in the same area and only sees family a few times a year. It's reasonable to want to use that time for personal plans. The family member might have expected help, but it's not a given that relatives must provide childcare without being asked directly. The author didn't set any prior expectations and clearly stated they had plans. \n\nAlso, the family member's reaction seems over the top. Instead of seeking other solutions, they turned to social media to express frustration, which could be seen as embarrassing or confrontational. The author might be within their rights to prioritize their own time, especially since they don't live there and it's their vacation.\n\nOn the other hand, family can sometimes come with unspoken expectations. The author's refusal might be perceived as selfish, especially if there's a history of such requests. However, the situation isn't clear on past interactions. The author also mentions that the family member is bad about expecting childcare, which adds context for not wanting to enable that behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the family member's actions were poor, the author's refusal to babysit on their vacation without being directly asked might not be in the wrong. They had the right to set boundaries and use their limited time as they wished. So the answer is B.\n"
