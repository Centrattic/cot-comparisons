They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author declining to babysit a family member's toddler during a vacation visit, leading to Facebook posts from the family member criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lives far from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. They took time off work to visit during Christmas. When asked to babysit, the author initially declined, explaining they had plans. The family member then used Facebook to vent publicly, making the author feel targeted.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and expectations. The author didn't feel obligated to babysit, especially since they were on vacation and had made plans. The family member, however, expected family support, which might be common in their culture or family dynamics. The author's refusal isn't necessarily selfish; they're asserting their right to personal time. However, the way the family member handled it\u2014public shaming\u2014was inappropriate.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. From my perspective, the author isn't in the wrong because they had every right to say no. The family member's public accusations of selfishness without considering the author's perspective is the real issue here. The author isn't setting a bad precedent by saying no; they're setting a boundary. The problem is more about the family member's overreaction and lack of consideration for the author's time and autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to prioritize their own plans and not be expected to provide childcare without being asked directly or feeling pressured by public shaming.\n"
