They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author lives far from their family, only sees them a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member (maybe a sister or cousin?) needed childcare because her MIL backed out and others were busy. The author was asked through someone else, not directly. They declined because they had plans. Then the family member posted negative things on Facebook, implying the author is selfish. The author hasn't had issues with the family since but feels judged.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks at whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or crossed a line.\n\nThe author didn't directly ask and had their own plans. But the other person used Facebook to vent publicly, which is harsh. The author had the option to help but chose not to. However, the other person didn't seek alternatives first. \n\nI think the key here is that the author wasn't asked directly, but once approached, they said no. The other person's response was more inconsiderate. The author had valid reasons for not wanting to set a precedent. However, maybe they should have communicated more, even if they declined. But given the circumstances, the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The other person's public shaming is the bigger issue. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to prioritize their own plans, especially since they don't live nearby and only visit occasionally. The family member's reaction was more harmful. But maybe there's a nuance if the author should have offered to help despite their plans. However, the user's reasoning about not wanting to set a precedent is valid. So, B makes sense.\n"
