They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the author was visiting family for a holiday and had taken time off work. They had plans to relax and spend time with family. The family member in question needed childcare because her mother-in-law backed out and others were working. She didn't ask the author directly but had someone else do it. The author declined, and the family member then posted negative comments on Facebook. The author feels this was unfair, especially since they don't live near the family and only visit a couple times a year.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author had their own plans and was in a different state. They didn't feel obligated to take over childcare, especially since the request was made through someone else. The family member's reaction on Facebook seems harsh and public, which is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, family can sometimes expect support in emergencies. But in this case, the author wasn't asked directly, and they had valid plans. The family member's approach of using Facebook to vent and imply others are selfish might have been inappropriate. The author's decision to not take the responsibility isn't necessarily wrong if they weren't consulted properly. \n\nAlso, considering that the author is in a different part of the country and doesn't see family often, their time might be limited. The family member should have explored other options before turning to Facebook. The key points here are the lack of direct communication and the public shaming, which seems more at fault than the author's refusal. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for saying no, especially since they were not directly asked and had their own plans. The family member's reaction is more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
