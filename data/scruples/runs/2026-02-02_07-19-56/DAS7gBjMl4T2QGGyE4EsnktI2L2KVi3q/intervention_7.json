They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit a family member's toddler during their vacation. The author is in a different part of the country from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. They were visiting during Christmas, had plans, and when asked by a family member (not directly) to watch the kid, they said no. The family member then posted negative comments on Facebook, leading to ongoing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations and norms around family obligations. The author mentions they don't live nearby and visit infrequently. They had their own plans and chose not to rearrange them. The family member, however, expected the author to be available, which might be a stretch given the distance and frequency of visits.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was not directly asked but found out through messages, the family member used social media to vent publicly, and there's a history of the family member expecting others to provide childcare. The author's refusal wasn't selfish in this context because they had their own plans, and it's not their responsibility to be on call for family childcare, especially from a distance.\n\nOn the other hand, the family member's reaction was harsh and public, which is problematic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were within their rights; they chose to prioritize their own plans and set boundaries. The family member's behavior is more concerning, but the original question is about the author.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have a pre-existing commitment and were clear about their plans. They weren't avoiding responsibility but were respecting their own time. The family member's expectations might be unreasonable given the circumstances. So, answer B (No).\n"
