They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining to babysit a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is visiting family from out of town for the holidays. They had plans to spend time together and had taken time off work. A family member asked for help watching her 3-year-old because her mother-in-law backed out and others were busy. The author was asked through intermediaries and declined, stating they had plans. The family member then publicly shamed them on Facebook, which upset the author.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author was on vacation, which is their time to relax and enjoy. They didn't live in the same area and only saw family a couple times a year. The request came through others, not directly from the family member. The author had the choice to say no but did so politely. However, the family member's reaction was public and harsh, which seems excessive.\n\nThe author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially when they're on vacation. Family dynamics can vary, but expecting others to be on-call for childcare without considering their own schedules is unreasonable. The family member's response of using Facebook to vent and imply blame is problematic. The author's decision to decline and avoid conflict seems reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It doesn't seem so. They had the right to prioritize their own plans and were within their rights to refuse. The real issue is the family member's public shaming. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
