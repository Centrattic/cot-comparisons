They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the \"AITA\" person) is wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member's toddler needed watching because the mother had work and the MIL backed out. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had others do it. The author declined, then the family member posted negative stuff on Facebook about being selfish. The author feels they had the right to say no, especially since they were on vacation and don't live there, and don't want to set a precedent.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author have a responsibility to say yes? The author was on vacation with their own plans, and the request wasn't made directly to them. The family member used Facebook to vent instead of seeking other solutions. The author didn't set a precedent before, and the family member seems to have a history of expecting others to drop their plans for childcare.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation here. Family obligations are often social or emotional, not legal. The author's decision to prioritize their own plans is about personal boundaries. The problem arises from the family member's reaction\u2014public shaming on social media is problematic. The author didn't do anything wrong by declining a request that wasn't directly made to them. They\u2019re also trying to protect their autonomy and set boundaries, which is reasonable, especially when living far away.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. The family member is in the wrong for publicly shaming and holding a grudge. The author's \"no\" is valid, and they're not obligated to say yes. The Facebook posts and subsequent comments are the issues here, not the author's refusal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
