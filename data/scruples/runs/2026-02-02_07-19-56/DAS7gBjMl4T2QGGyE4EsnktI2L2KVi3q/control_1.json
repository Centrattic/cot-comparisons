They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a different part of the country from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a Christmas visit, a family member (unclear which one, but mentioned as a relative) needed someone to watch her 3-year-old. The author's family tried to get them to agree, but the author declined because they had plans. The family member then sent messages and posted on Facebook about the author being selfish, implying they should have helped. The author feels like they weren't obligated to do this, especially since they don't live nearby and don't want to set a precedent for future childcare.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and expectations. In some families, there's an expectation that relatives help out with childcare, especially during holidays. However, the author is not local and only visits a few times a year. They had prior plans, and the request came up without direct communication from the family member. The author declined politely and then faced public shaming on Facebook, which seems harsh.\n\nThe key points here: the author had the right to make their own plans, especially when they're not living in the same area. The family member didn't approach the author directly but had someone else ask. The public Facebook posts were inappropriate and confrontational. The author's reasoning about not wanting to set a precedent is valid because it's about personal boundaries, especially when it's not their responsibility. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to help family in need, but there's also the aspect of personal time and boundaries. The author wasn't being selfish by declining; they were prioritizing their own plans. The family member's response was more about shaming than understanding. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
