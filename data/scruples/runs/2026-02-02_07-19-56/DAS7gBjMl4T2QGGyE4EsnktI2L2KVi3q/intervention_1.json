They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to babysit a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author lives far from their family and only visits a couple of times a year. During a visit, a family member's mother-in-law couldn't watch her 3-year-old, and the family member asked others who were busy. Then, without directly asking the author, someone else asked the author, who declined because they had plans. The family member then messaged the author and posted on Facebook, criticizing the author's decision.\n\nThe author feels they were within their rights to decline, as it was their vacation and they don't live nearby. The family member, on the other hand, seemed upset and used social media to vent, which might have been public shaming.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are communication, expectations, and boundaries. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had someone else do it. The author had plans they wanted to keep, and the family member's reaction was public and harsh. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, there's no legal obligation here, but family dynamics can be complex. The author might have a right to set boundaries, especially if they don't live nearby and only visit occasionally. However, the family member might expect some support from extended family, especially when emergencies happen. \n\nBut the way the family member reacted\u2014using Facebook posts to vent and make others feel guilty\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's refusal wasn't malicious; they had plans and were clear about their availability. The family member's public shaming adds another layer of conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for saying no, especially since they were clear about their plans and the family member didn't approach them directly. The family member's response was more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
