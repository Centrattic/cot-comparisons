They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether they did something wrong by refusing to babysit a family member's toddler while on vacation. \n\nFirst, the context: They live far away from family and only see them a couple times a year. They were on vacation visiting family during Christmas, taking time off work. The family member had a last-minute childcare issue, asked someone else to ask the author, who said no because they had plans. The family member then messaged and posted on Facebook, calling the author selfish, etc. The author didn't want to set a precedent for future childcare requests and didn't feel obligated.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did the author have a responsibility to babysit? The user is in a different part of the country, only sees family occasionally. They had plans they wanted to keep. The family member didn't directly ask them but had someone else do it, then got upset when they said no. The author didn't make it easy for the other person to find childcare, but the problem was that the author declined a request that wasn't even directly made to them. \n\nBut here's the thing: The family member's approach was poor. They didn't ask the author directly, then used social media to shame them. The author had the right to say no, especially since they were on vacation and had their own plans. The family member's reaction was over the top and inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author isn't living in the same area, so expecting them to be on call isn't fair. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own plans and setting boundaries. The family member's resentment and public shaming are their own issues. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They had the right to decline, especially given the circumstances and the family member's approach.\n"
