They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the person is at fault for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation.\n\nFirst, the person was visiting family for Christmas and had plans to spend time with them. The family member needed someone to watch her 3-year-old because her mom (the MIL) backed out and others were busy. She didn't ask the author directly but had someone else do it. The author said no because they had plans. Then the family member started messaging and posting on Facebook, making it look like the author was selfish.\n\nI need to consider a few things. The author was on vacation, which is their time to relax. They live far away and see family only a couple times a year. The request was made through others, not directly, which might be a bit inconsiderate. The author had the option to say yes but chose not to, which is their right. However, the family member's reaction\u2014posting on Facebook and making it public\u2014seems harsh. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining. In many cases, people have the right to say no, especially if they've made plans. Family responsibilities can be tricky, but the author isn't obligated to help unless there's an expectation or prior agreement. The family member's approach of using Facebook to shame others might indicate her own issues, but the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to their own time, the fact that the request was indirect, and the family member's public backlash. The author didn't set a precedent because they're not in the same area, so expecting them to be on call isn't reasonable. The author's decision not to cancel plans seems valid. The family member's actions are more problematic, but the question is about the author's fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to say no, and the family member overreacted. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
