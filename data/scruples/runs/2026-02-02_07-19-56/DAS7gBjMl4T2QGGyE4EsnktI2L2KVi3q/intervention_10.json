They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The key points here are the context and the family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author lives far away from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. They took time off work to visit during Christmas, which is a common time for family gatherings. The situation arose where a family member needed childcare, but instead of directly asking the author, she asked someone else who also had to work. The author turned it down because they had plans, which is understandable given they had taken time off specifically to relax and spend time with family. \n\nThen, the family member reacted strongly by posting negative comments on Facebook, implying selfishness and causing tension. The author didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare, which seems reasonable given the distance and limited time together. They also mentioned that the family member often expects others to be available, which adds to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author had valid reasons for declining\u2014personal plans, prior commitment to their own vacation time, and the distance from the family. They clearly communicated their refusal. The main issue here is the family member's reaction, which was public criticism and passive-aggressive comments. The author isn't obligated to help unless there's an expectation based on prior agreements or cultural norms, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. \n\nThe author's choice to not engage further because they don't want conflict during limited family time also makes sense. They didn't create the problem; the other person did by not respecting the author's decision and using social media to vent. So, the author isn't in the wrong for declining, especially since they had plans and the request wasn't made directly to them. The onus is on the family member to find alternative childcare solutions rather than making the author feel guilty.\n"
