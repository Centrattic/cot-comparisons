They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is visiting family for a vacation, specifically during Christmas. They had planned their own activities. A family member needed childcare for her 3-year-old because her own mom backed out. The family member didn't ask the author directly; someone else approached the author, who then said no. The author didn't feel obligated and had their own plans. The family member then took it to Facebook, making negative posts, which upset the author. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was not asked by the family member herself, had their own plans, and the family member resorted to public shaming on Facebook instead of finding another solution. The author didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare.\n\nSo, the author says no to a request they weren't directly asked. The family member didn't ask the author personally, so the author might not feel it's their responsibility. The author's reasons for declining are valid\u2014they had plans and didn't want to be expected to be available. The family member's response was inconsiderate and public, which seems more about venting than resolving the issue. \n\nLegally or morally, the author isn't obligated to help if they weren't asked directly. The family member's handling of the situation seems worse. The author's decision to decline their own plans isn't selfish if they communicated that clearly. Plus, the author isn't in the same area, so maybe the expectation is unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more on the family member for not respecting the author's choice and for the Facebook posts. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
