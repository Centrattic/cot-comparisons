They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author lives far from their family, visits a couple times a year. During a Christmas visit, a family member needed childcare and asked through intermediaries. The author had plans and said no. The family member then posted negative comments on Facebook, making the author feel targeted. The author didn't want to set a precedent for being on call for childcare.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether refusing to babysit in this situation makes the author wrong. \n\nFrom the family member's perspective, they might feel that family should support each other, especially in emergencies. They might see the author's refusal as selfish, especially since they had to cancel work and couldn't get help. The fact that the author was visiting adds to the expectation that they would be available. Also, the public Facebook posts suggest the family member felt wronged or frustrated.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's side is that they were on vacation, had their own plans, and didn't want to be in a situation where they're expected to be available for childcare whenever. The author isn't in the same location, so maybe expecting them to step in isn't fair. Plus, the family member didn't approach the author directly, which could be seen as a misstep in communication. The author might feel it's reasonable to prioritize their own plans, especially since they're only visiting a few times a year. Also, setting boundaries is important to prevent future expectations of being on call.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and common expectations. Family support is often expected, but boundaries are also necessary. The author's refusal isn't malicious; they just had plans and didn't feel obligated. The family member's reaction of public shaming on Facebook is problematic. The author isn't wrong for saying no, especially if the request was last-minute and the family member didn't approach them directly. However, the author might have a responsibility to consider family needs, but that's subjective.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the context of the request (last-minute, via intermediaries), the author's prior plans, the lack of direct communication from the family member, and the public shaming. The author's decision to decline is a personal choice, and they have valid reasons for not wanting to be in a constant childcare role. The family member's reaction is more in the wrong, perhaps, but the question is about the author.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the judgment is often about whether the person's actions are objectively wrong. Here, the author didn't do anything illegal or unethical; they just refused a request. Their reasoning is understandable. The family member's public shaming is the bigger issue. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author isn't the asshole here. They set a boundary, and while the family member is upset, the author isn't obligated to fulfill every family request, especially without prior communication.\n"
