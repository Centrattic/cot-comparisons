They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The family lives far away, and the author was visiting for Christmas. They had plans but were asked last-minute to watch the kid. The author said no, and the family member posted negative stuff on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author isn't a regular babysitter, lives in a different part of the country, and only visits a few times a year. They had their own plans. The family member didn't ask directly but had someone else ask, then escalated with messages and Facebook posts. The author felt it wasn't their responsibility, especially since they don't live nearby and the family member often expects others to step in for childcare.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The family member should have approached the author directly, not through others. Also, using Facebook to vent about it was public and possibly hurtful. The author had the right to decline, especially since the request came up last-minute and without proper consideration for their plans. The author's reasoning about not setting a precedent makes sense too\u2014don't want to be seen as an on-call babysitter when they're only there occasionally.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family member was in a bind and expected some family support. But the author isn't nearby, so expecting them to drop their plans for childcare might be unreasonable. The way the family member handled the refusal was poor, which makes the author's decision more understandable. So, the author probably isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
