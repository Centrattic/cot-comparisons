They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The key points here are the context and the actions taken by both parties.\n\nFirst, the author lives far from their family and only visits a few times a year. They took time off work for the visit, planning to relax and have their own activities. The family member asked others first, then approached the author without directly asking. The author declined, which led to Facebook posts from the family member that were harsh and public.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had an obligation to babysit. Since the author doesn't live nearby and only visits occasionally, it's reasonable that they prioritized their own plans. The family member didn't ask directly and instead used intermediaries, which might have contributed to the misunderstanding. Additionally, the family member's response of public shaming seems excessive and inappropriate. The author's decision not to take responsibility for childcare wasn't selfish if it was a one-time request and not something they could reasonably be expected to accommodate without prior agreement.\n\nAnother angle is the precedent. The author mentions that the family member often expects others to be on call for childcare, which isn't fair. The author's refusal to set that precedent is a valid reason. The family member's reaction, however, was problematic because they didn't seek alternative solutions and instead vented publicly, which is disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to their personal time and the family member's approach was inappropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
