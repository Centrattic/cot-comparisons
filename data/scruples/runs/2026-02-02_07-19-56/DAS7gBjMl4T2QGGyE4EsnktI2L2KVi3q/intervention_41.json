They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The situation involves the author being in a different part of the country, visiting for Christmas, and the family member's MIL backing out. The author was asked indirectly (via someone else) to watch the kid, and when they said no, the family member posted negative things on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author was on vacation, had plans, and the family member didn't ask them directly but had someone else do it. The family member then reacted harshly on social media. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around family obligations. In some families, there's an expectation that you help, especially with childcare. But the author is in a different state and only sees family a couple times a year. They had their own plans and the family member's approach might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe family member's actions\u2014public shaming on Facebook\u2014seem excessive. The author didn't agree to help in the first place, and the family member didn't try other options before posting. The author's refusal isn't necessarily selfish if they were clear about their plans. Also, setting boundaries is important, especially if this family member has a history of expecting others to be on call.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as not being supportive enough. But given the circumstances\u2014distance, infrequent visits, lack of direct communication\u2014the author's position could be justified. The key is whether the author had a responsibility. Since it's a family member but not a parent, maybe the expectation isn't as strong. Plus, the mother's reaction was inappropriate.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They had their own plans, were clear about not being able to help, and the mother's response was the real issue. The answer should be B.\n"
