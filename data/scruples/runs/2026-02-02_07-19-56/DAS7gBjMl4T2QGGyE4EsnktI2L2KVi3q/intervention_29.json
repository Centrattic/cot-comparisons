They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The situation is that the author was visiting family for Christmas, had plans, and a family member (let's call her Person X) needed childcare. The author's family initially said no because they had to work, then the author was approached via messages and Facebook posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives far away and only sees family a few times a year. They had taken time off to visit. When asked, they declined because they had plans. The family member then publicly shamed them on Facebook, implying selfishness. \n\nSo, the author's side: They weren't directly asked first; someone else asked their family, who then passed it to the author. The author had their own plans, and didn't want to be in a position where they're expected to be on call for childcare. The family member's reaction seems harsh, especially using Facebook to vent and call others selfish. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author might feel they have the right to their own plans, especially when they're visiting family and not local. However, family obligations can be complex. Did the author have an obligation to help in this case? It depends on cultural expectations and prior relationships. If this is a recurring issue where the family member expects everyone to be available, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries. \n\nBut the flip side is, when in a family setting, especially during holidays, there might be an unspoken expectation to help out. The author declined politely, but the family member's public shaming is definitely inconsiderate. However, the initial refusal might be seen as selfish if the author didn't consider the family member's urgent need. But the author argues they could have canceled their plans, but chose not to. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's refusal was reasonable. Since they were on vacation and had plans, and the family member didn't approach them directly first, the author's \"no\" isn't necessarily wrong. Plus, the family member's response was inappropriate. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They set a boundary, which is okay. The family member's actions are the main issue here. So answer B.\n"
