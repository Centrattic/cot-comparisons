They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a Christmas visit, a family member needed childcare because her MIL backed out and others were working. She asked someone else to ask the author, who said no because they had plans. Then the family member posted negative things on Facebook about the author being selfish, etc.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're at fault. I need to consider both sides. The family member needed help, but the author had their own plans and isn't living there. The author didn't say yes, which the family member responded to publicly. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and boundaries. The author might feel it's their right to have their own plans, especially when they're on vacation. The family member, on the other hand, might feel that family should support each other, especially in emergencies. However, the family member's approach of using Facebook to criticize someone who said no could be seen as inconsiderate or shaming. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that this family member often expects others to be on call for childcare, which might be part of the issue. The author is setting a boundary by not complying, which is okay, but the public shaming is problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for declining, especially since they were on vacation and it's their personal time. However, the family member's reaction is more clearly wrong. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nIf the author had a valid reason to decline (their own plans, being away from home), then they aren't in the wrong. The family member overstepped by publicizing it. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But some might argue that family obligations take precedence, but that's subjective. The author isn't living there, so maybe they aren't obligated. \n\nAlso, the author didn't set up a precedent by saying no, which could be important for future interactions. The family member's behavior is more the issue here. So I think the author is not in the wrong.\n"
