They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not babysitting a family member's toddler during a vacation visit. The author lives far away, visited for Christmas, had plans, and the family member didn't ask them directly but had someone else do it. When the author declined, the family member posted negative comments on Facebook.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author wasn't directly asked. The family member asked someone else to ask the author, which could be seen as not respecting the author's autonomy. The author had their own plans, which makes sense, especially since they travel a long distance to see family. \n\nThe family member's response of posting on Facebook publicly shaming others is problematic. Using social media to vent about family matters is usually unwise and can come off as aggressive. The author might feel justified in declining since they didn't commit to any prior responsibilities.\n\nHowever, family situations can be complex. The author might be seen as selfish if they don't help, but they also have the right to set boundaries. The key points are: the request wasn't direct, the author had existing plans, the family member's reaction was harsh, and there's a history of the family member expecting childcare from others.\n\nThe author's decision to not help and the subsequent Facebook posts might not make them the asshole here. The family member's public shaming seems more like the issue. The author didn't set a precedent because the request wasn't made properly, and they lived far away. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
