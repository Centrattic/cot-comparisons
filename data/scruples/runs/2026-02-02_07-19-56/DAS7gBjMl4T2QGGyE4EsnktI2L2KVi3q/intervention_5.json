They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The author is visiting family, took time off work, had plans, and declined the request. The family member then publicly shamed them on Facebook. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. They live far from family, only visit a few times a year, and had plans they wanted to keep. They didn't want to take on the responsibility of babysitting, especially since they didn't directly ask. The family member's approach\u2014using others to ask and then shaming publicly\u2014seems harsh. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when it's an inconvenience.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other, especially in emergencies. But in this case, it seems the family member didn't try other options first and instead blamed the author. The author also mentions that this person has a history of expecting others to be on call, which adds context. \n\nThe key points are the lack of direct communication from the family member, the author's right to have their own plans, and the public shaming. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They made a choice to prioritize their own plans, which is reasonable. The family member's reaction, however, is problematic. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to decline and aren't responsible for the family member's poor handling of the situation.\n"
