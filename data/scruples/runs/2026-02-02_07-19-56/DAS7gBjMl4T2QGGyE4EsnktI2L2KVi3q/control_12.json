They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year, like during Christmas. While visiting, a family member needed someone to watch her 3-year-old because her mother-in-law backed out and others were busy. The author was asked through another family member, not directly. The author declined because they had plans. Then the family member started messaging the author and even posted about it on Facebook, making the author feel targeted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. The author was offered a chance to babysit but had plans and said no. They didn't want to cancel their plans and didn't feel obligated. The key points here are that the author was not directly asked first. The family member went through another person to ask, which might be a point. Also, the author was in a vacation setting, which is supposed to be their time to relax and see family, not take on unexpected responsibilities.\n\nThen there's the response from the family member. She kept messaging and then took it to Facebook, which is more about her reaction than the author's initial refusal. The author didn't force her to post; she did that herself. The author's refusal was polite, and they had a valid reason for having plans. The fact that the family member had to work adds some context, but the author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially when not asked directly.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that this family member often expects others to be on call for childcare, and the author wants to avoid setting a precedent. That's a reasonable concern. The author is prioritizing their own plans during a limited vacation, which isn't unreasonable. The family member's public shaming is extreme, and the author isn't at fault for that. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author had the right to say no when asked through someone else, especially since they had their own plans. The family member's reaction was over the top and not the author's fault. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
