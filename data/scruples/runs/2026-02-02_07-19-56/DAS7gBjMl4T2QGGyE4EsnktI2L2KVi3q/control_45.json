They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author lives far away and only sees family a couple times a year. They took time off work to visit. The family member needed childcare, but instead of contacting the author directly, someone else asked. The author said no because they had plans. Then the family member messaged them and even posted negative things on Facebook. The author feels they didn't have to do it and didn't want to set a precedent. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was not asked directly, had their own plans which they had already arranged, and the family member didn't look for alternative solutions instead of badmouthing the author. The author also mentions that the family member often expects others to be on call for childcare, which they don't want to enable.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations of family. It's common for extended family to help, but it's not a given, especially if there's no prior expectation. The author wasn't in their home location, so traveling to care for a toddler might be more of a burden. Also, the family member didn't try to find other options but instead criticized publicly. The author's refusal seems reasonable if they had prior plans and didn't want to be in a position where they're expected to drop everything. \n\nThe fact that the author didn't want to set a precedent is valid. If someone else is already working and can't help, it's not fair to pressure another family member without considering their own commitments. The family member's reaction is more problematic because of the public shaming and not seeking alternatives. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to say no, and the family member's approach was inappropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
