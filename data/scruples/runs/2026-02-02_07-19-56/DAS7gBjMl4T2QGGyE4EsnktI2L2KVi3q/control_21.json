They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The situation involves the author being in another state visiting family. They had plans during their vacation, and a family member asked via others to watch the kid, but the author declined. The family member then posted negative things on Facebook, leading to ongoing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. The author was on vacation in their own time, which they had taken off work specifically to spend with family. They turned down the request because they had their own plans. The family member didn't directly ask the author but had someone else do it, which might come off as passive-aggressive. The author's refusal seems reasonable since they were on vacation and had the right to use their time as they pleased.\n\nThe family member's response, however, seems excessive. Using Facebook to vent about the situation and implying that others are selfish is a public way to shame someone, which can be hurtful. The author had already explained they had plans, and the family member didn't seek alternative solutions, which is a problem. The author wasn't obligated to help, especially since they live far away and don't see their family often. Setting boundaries is important, and the author's decision to not let the family member rely on them for childcare in the future is understandable.\n\nLooking at the options, A would mean the author is in the wrong, but given the context, they had a right to their time and the family member's reaction was inappropriate. So, the answer should be B.\n"
