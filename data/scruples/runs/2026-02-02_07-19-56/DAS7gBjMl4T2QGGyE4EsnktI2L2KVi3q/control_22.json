They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author was visiting family for Christmas, had plans with their family, and a family member asked them to babysit her toddler when others couldn't. The author said no, and the family member publicly shamed them on Facebook. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to say no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lives far away and only sees the family a couple times a year. They had plans during their vacation time. The family member didn't directly ask the author but had someone else do it, which might be a red flag. The author declined politely, which seems reasonable. The real issue is the family member's response\u2014posting on Facebook to humiliate the author, implying others are selfish, and making it about herself needing help. \n\nThe author didn't force themselves to say yes, but they also didn't argue back. They just wanted to enjoy their time with family without conflict. The key points here are the author's right to set boundaries, especially since they're not living nearby and don't have to be on call. The family member's reaction is clearly inappropriate and public shaming is a problem. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation here. Morally, family can have different expectations, but the author isn't obligated to say yes. The family member's approach was wrong. The author's decision to say no and not engage further is understandable. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because refusing to help in this situation is their right, especially with the context provided. The main issue is the family member's behavior, not the author's refusal.\n"
