They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the context: The author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member's toddler needed babysitting because the mother had to work and the MIL backed out. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had someone else ask. The author declined because they had plans. The family member then posted negative comments on Facebook, making the author feel targeted.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author was on vacation, which is their time to relax and enjoy. They were visiting family, so maybe there's an expectation of helping, but the family member didn't ask the author directly. The author had already made plans, and it wasn't their responsibility to be on call. Also, the family member's reaction\u2014public shaming on Facebook\u2014seems excessive and hostile. The author didn't want to set a precedent where they're expected to be available for childcare every time they visit.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other, especially in emergencies. But in this case, the mother had an option (MIL) who backed out, but maybe there's a pattern of expecting others to step in. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable given the distance and limited time with family. The family member's handling of the situation (not asking directly, using social media to vent) is problematic.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to say no and enjoy their vacation. The fault lies more with the family member for not asking respectfully and the public shaming. Therefore, the answer is B."
