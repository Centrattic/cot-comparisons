They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to understand the key points.\n\nThe author is visiting family for Christmas, took time off work. A family member (not specified, maybe a sibling?) needed someone to watch her 3-year-old because her MIL backed out. The author's family initially said no because they had work, then asked the author. The author declined because they had plans. The family member then bombarded the author with messages questioning their decision and posted negative stuff on Facebook. The author didn't engage further and now feels the family might hold it against them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say no. Let me break down the factors. The author lives far away, only sees family a couple times a year. They had plans for the day. The family member didn't approach the author directly but had someone else ask. The author declined, then the family member posted publicly about it, implying selfishness.\n\nIn terms of obligations, family babysitting isn't typically required unless it's a mutual agreement or cultural norm. The author isn't local, so expecting them to step in might be unreasonable. The family member's approach\u2014using intermediaries and public shaming\u2014seems aggressive. The author had the right to prioritize their own plans, especially since they were on vacation. Also, the family member's pattern of expecting others to be on call for childcare suggests a recurring issue, not an isolated incident.\n\nThe author's decision to not engage further to avoid conflict during limited family time is understandable. Setting boundaries is important here. While the author could have offered to help, they weren't obligated. The family member's reaction was more problematic, using public shaming which is often counterproductive. The author isn't in the wrong because they made a personal choice without being asked directly and the other party overreacted inappropriately.\n"
