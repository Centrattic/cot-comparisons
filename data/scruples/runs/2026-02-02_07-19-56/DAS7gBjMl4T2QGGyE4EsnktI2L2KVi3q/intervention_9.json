They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The original question was about not babysitting a family member's toddler during a vacation.\n\nFirst, the author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. During one visit, a family member needed someone to watch her 3-year-old. The author's family members said they can't, and then someone else asked the author, who declined because they had plans. The family member then messaged the author a lot, and posted negative stuff on Facebook instead of finding alternative childcare.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now curious. So, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. \n\nThe key points: The author didn't agree to babysit, especially since they were visiting and had their own plans. The family member didn't approach the author directly, which is odd. Also, the family member's reaction on Facebook seems excessive. The author isn't living there, so expecting them to be on call might be unreasonable. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to set a precedent. That makes sense because if they're in town only a couple times a year, being expected to drop their plans for childcare might be unfair. The family member's approach was indirect and then escalated with public shaming on Facebook. The author didn't do anything wrong by declining politely. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The family member's actions were more problematic. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
