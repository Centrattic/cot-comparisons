They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author lives far away from their family, only sees them a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member needed babysitting because her MIL backed out and others were busy. The author was asked through another person, not directly. They declined because they had plans. The family member then posted negative stuff on Facebook, implying the author is selfish. The author feels they didn't have to do it since they're not living there and don't want to set a precedent.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are expectations, communication, and boundaries. The family member expected the author to help, but the author had their own plans. The author didn't agree to help beforehand, so maybe the family member shouldn't assume they'd be available. However, the family member's approach of publicly shaming on Facebook is problematic. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't unreasonable if they hadn't committed to helping. They made their plans clear. The family member's reaction, though, seems excessive. But the author might have handled the decline more gracefully. However, the main issue is the family member's public shaming rather than the refusal itself. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for saying no, especially since they were in a vacation and not local. So, answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
