They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author declining to babysit a family member's toddler during a vacation and then the family member blowing up Facebook with complaints.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author lives far away from their family and only sees them a couple of times a year. During a visit, the family member asked them to babysit, but the author had plans. The family member didn't ask directly but had someone else relay the request. The author declined and then got messages and Facebook rants from the family member. The author didn't feel obligated to help, especially since they don't live there and don't want to set a precedent.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around family responsibilities. In some families, helping with childcare is expected, but in others, people might prioritize their own time, especially when visiting. The key points here are consent, communication, and expectations. The author wasn't asked directly; someone else asked on their behalf. Then the family member's reaction was public shaming on Facebook, which is problematic.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to decline. The author had made plans and was in their own personal time. The family member's approach was poor\u2014public shaming instead of finding another solution. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be treated as on-call for childcare, which is a reasonable boundary. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the family member for not handling the situation respectfully and for public shaming. The author had the right to decline their own plans, especially given the distance and the lack of direct communication.\n"
