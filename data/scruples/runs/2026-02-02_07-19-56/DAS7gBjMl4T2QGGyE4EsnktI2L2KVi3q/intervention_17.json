They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining to babysit a family member's toddler during their vacation, leading to some Facebook posts from that family member.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author lives far from their family and visits only a few times a year. During a visit, they had plans to shop and have dinner. A family member called and asked through others to watch the toddler, but when the author said no, the person complained via messages and then posted negative things on Facebook. The author feels they weren't obligated to babysit, especially since they don't live there and the family member often expects others to be available for childcare.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nKey points to consider: The family member asked indirectly, didn't approach the author directly. The author had plans and declined. The family member then publicized the situation on Facebook, which seems harsh. The author didn't set a precedent before, and the family member has a history of expecting others to help. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were on vacation, had their own plans, and it's reasonable to say no, especially if there's a history of being taken advantage of. The family member's response of public shaming could be seen as the wrong move. The author isn't obligated to help unless there's an established agreement, which there doesn't seem to be here.\n\nHowever, maybe the family member was in a bind and the author could have been more understanding. But since the author was on vacation and the request came up last-minute, it's not necessarily their fault for declining. The main issue is the family member's reaction, not the author's refusal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
