They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is visiting family for Christmas and had plans to shop and eat at their favorite restaurant. A family member's toddler needed babysitting because the mother had work and her mother-in-law bailed. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had someone else ask, and the author said no. Then the family member started messaging the author and posting on Facebook about how selfish people are and the like. The author didn't want to set a precedent of being on-call for childcare and wasn't willing to cancel their plans. Now the author is questioning if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives far away, sees family only a few times a year, and had made plans. The family member didn't approach the author directly, which could be a point in the author's favor. The author had the right to prioritize their own plans, especially since they don't live nearby and don't have the same availability as other family members who might be closer. \n\nThe family member's reaction seems a bit over the top. Instead of seeking alternative childcare solutions, she took to Facebook to vent, which could indicate her own issues with handling the situation. The author didn't obligate themselves because they didn't feel it was their responsibility. The key here is whether the author had an obligation to babysit. Since it wasn't a prior agreement or expectation, and considering the distance, the author's refusal seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that this family member often expects others to be available for childcare, which might be a pattern. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. The Facebook posts and the subsequent comments from the author suggest that the family member is holding a grudge, but that doesn't make the author at fault for saying no.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had valid reasons for declining and didn't create the conflict; the other person's reaction was the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
