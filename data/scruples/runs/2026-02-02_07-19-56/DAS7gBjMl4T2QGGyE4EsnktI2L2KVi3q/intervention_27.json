They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author lives far from their family and visits a couple of times a year. During a Christmas visit, they had plans to spend the day shopping and relaxing. A family member needed someone to watch her 3-year-old because her mother-in-law backed out and the others were working. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had someone else do it. The author declined, explaining they had plans. Then the family member sent messages and posted on Facebook criticizing the author and others, implying selfishness. The author feels the family member is holding a grudge and making \"must be nice\" comments. They don't want to argue with family since they don't see them often.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author had their own plans and was in a different state. They didn't live there, so maybe they weren't in a position to be on call. The family member didn't ask them directly, which might be a point. The author did decline when asked, and the family member's reaction was to post on Facebook, which seems like a harsh response. The author didn't force them to post; they made their own choice to do so. \n\nOn one hand, family obligations can vary. If it's a common issue where the family expects everyone to be available for childcare, maybe the author should have considered that. But on the other hand, the author was on vacation, had their own plans, and the request wasn't made directly to them. The family member's response of public shaming through Facebook seems excessive and inappropriate regardless of the situation. \n\nSo, considering that the author had the right to have their own plans and the family member's reaction was over the top, the author might not be in the wrong. The key points are: the request was made through others, not directly, the author declined politely, and the family member's public shaming was their own choice. The author's decision not to take on unexpected childcare during their vacation time is reasonable, especially living far away. They also set a boundary to prevent future expectations of being on call, which is a valid concern. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they had a right to their time and the family member overreacted.\n"
