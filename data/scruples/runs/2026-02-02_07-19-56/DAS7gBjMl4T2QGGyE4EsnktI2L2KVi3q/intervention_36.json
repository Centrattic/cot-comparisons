They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not agreeing to babysit a family member's toddler during a vacation. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is in a different part of the country from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member called and had someone else ask the author to babysit her 3-year-old because she had to work and her mother-in-law backed out. The author declined, having their own plans. Then the family member messaged aggressively, and even posted negative comments on Facebook. The author feels that the family member is expecting everyone to be on call for childcare and doesn't want to set a precedent. The question is whether the author is wrong for not agreeing.\n\nSo, considering the factors: The author was visiting family, had taken time off work, had their own plans, and declined a request that wasn't directly asked. The family member didn't ask the author personally but had someone else do it, then escalated with messages and Facebook posts. The author didn't feel obligated because they don't live nearby and don't want to be seen as on-call.\n\nPossible angles: Family obligations vs. personal time. The author had the right to say no, especially if it's a recurring expectation. The family member's reaction was inappropriate, using public shaming and guilt-tripping. However, maybe the author's refusal without direct communication could be seen as dismissive. But the main issue is that the family member didn't approach the author directly, then acted out publicly. The author's reasoning about setting a precedent is valid if this is a pattern.\n\nMost people might agree that the family member overreacted, but the author had the right to decline. The key points are that the author wasn't consulted directly and the other party made a scene. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
