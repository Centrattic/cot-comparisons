They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is in a different part of the country from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. During a visit for Christmas, the family member needed childcare because her mother-in-law backed out. The author was asked through another family member, not directly. They declined because they had plans. Then, the family member posted negative comments on Facebook and made passive-aggressive remarks later.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was not directly asked, they declined respectfully, and the family member used social media to express frustration. The author didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation unless there's a contract, which isn't the case here. Socially, family dynamics can vary. However, the author had the right to prioritize their own plans, especially since they live far away. The family member's response of using Facebook to vent and making it personal seems like an overreaction. The author didn't force anyone else to watch the child but was offered the option, and they declined without being rude initially. \n\nThe main issue is the family member's reaction rather than the author's refusal. The author's reasoning about not wanting to set a precedent is valid because if everyone expects you to be available, it can become burdensome. The fact that the author didn't engage further and others didn't bring it up suggests they might not agree with the family member's approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal was within their rights, and the family member's response was inappropriate. Answer B.\n"
