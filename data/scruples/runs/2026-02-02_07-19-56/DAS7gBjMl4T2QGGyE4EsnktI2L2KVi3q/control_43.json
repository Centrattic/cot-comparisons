They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a Christmas visit, they had plans for shopping and dining. A family member needed childcare, but instead of asking the author directly, someone else relayed the request. The author declined because they had plans. The family member then messaged and posted on Facebook, criticizing the author as selfish. The author didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was on vacation, had their own plans, and declined a request that wasn't directly asked of them. The family member didn't approach the author first, sought help from others who were working, then turned to Facebook to vent. The author isn't local, so they don't live near the family.\n\nI need to consider if the author had an obligation. Family dynamics vary, but generally, unless there's a prior agreement or expectation, you're not obligated to help. The author was visiting, had limited time, and had plans. The family member's reaction seems harsh, especially using social media to shame the author. The author's refusal isn't selfish if they didn't have the time or wanted to set boundaries, especially since the family member didn't ask them directly first.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the family member often expects others to be available for childcare. The author is trying to avoid setting a precedent, which is reasonable. The Facebook posts were public shaming, which is problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong for declining their own plans to help, especially when the request wasn't made to them directly and the response was excessive.\n"
