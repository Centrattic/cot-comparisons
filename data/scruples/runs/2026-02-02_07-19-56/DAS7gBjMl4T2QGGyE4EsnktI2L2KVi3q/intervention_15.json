They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not babysitting their family member's toddler during their vacation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lives far from their family, visits a couple times a year. They had taken time off to visit, and had plans. The family member needed babysitting, but didn't ask the author directly; instead, someone else relayed the request. The author declined, which led to the family member posting negative things on Facebook. The author now feels the family member is upset and holds a grudge, but they didn't want to set a precedent for being on-call for childcare.\n\nThe key points here are: the author wasn't directly asked, they had prior plans, and they live far away. The family member didn't look for other solutions but instead vented publicly. The author didn't feel obligated and wanted to avoid future expectations.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person acted unreasonably. The author's decision to prioritize their own plans over an unexpected request, especially without a direct ask, might be seen as reasonable. The family member's reaction\u2014public shaming and not seeking alternatives\u2014could indicate the problem lies with them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since it's a family need, the author should have been more accommodating. But given the circumstances\u2014geographical distance, infrequent visits, and the indirect request\u2014it's a bit more nuanced. The author wasn't in a position where they were obligated, and the family member's handling of the situation was poor.\n\nSo, balancing these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issues are with the family member's approach. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
