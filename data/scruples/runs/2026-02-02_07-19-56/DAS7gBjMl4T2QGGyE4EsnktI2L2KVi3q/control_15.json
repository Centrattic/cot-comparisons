They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author lives far from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member needed childcare because her MIL backed out and others were working. She didn't ask the author directly; someone else did. The author declined, had plans, and then faced Facebook posts from the family member about being selfish. The author feels they didn't have to do it and don't want to set a precedent.\n\nNow, the key points. The family member didn't ask the author directly but went through others. The author had plans and declined. The family member responded with public shaming on Facebook. The author is concerned about being seen as selfish but also wants to avoid future expectations.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation unless there's a formal agreement, but family matters are more about social norms. The question is about social expectations. Did the author wrong by saying no?\n\nFactors to consider: The author was on vacation, had plans, and the family member didn't ask them directly. The author lives far away, so regular childcare isn't feasible. The family member's reaction was public shaming, which seems excessive. The author isn't in a position where they can be relied upon regularly since they're not local.\n\nPossible arguments: Some might say family should help, but others would argue that the author isn't obligated to drop their plans, especially when not asked directly. The family member's approach was poor\u2014using Facebook instead of resolving the issue privately. The author's refusal is reasonable, and the family member's reaction is the real issue here.\n\nSo, putting it together: The author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to say no, especially given the circumstances and the lack of direct request. The family member's response was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
