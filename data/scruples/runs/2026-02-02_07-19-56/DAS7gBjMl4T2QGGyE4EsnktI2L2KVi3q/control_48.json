They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to babysit a family member's toddler during a vacation. The user wants a decision between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author was visiting family for Christmas, had taken time off work. A family member needed babysitting because her MIL backed out. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had someone else do it. The author said no, had plans, and then the family member started messaging and posting on Facebook about it. The author didn't want to set a precedent of being on-call for childcare since they don't live nearby and only visit a couple times a year.\n\nNow, considering the ethical side. The author was there for a vacation, had plans. They didn't live in the same area and only saw family occasionally. The family member didn't approach them directly, which could be seen as a lack of respect. The author had the choice to help but chose not to, which is their right. The family member's reaction on Facebook seems like public shaming and blaming others, which is not appropriate. The author didn't force the situation; they were asked through others and declined. Setting boundaries is important, especially in family dynamics where expectations can be high but unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should help each other in emergencies. However, the author was on vacation, and the family member didn't ask directly first. The author also mentions that this person is used to expecting others to be on call for childcare, which isn't fair. The author's reasons for saying no are valid\u2014personal time, not living nearby, not wanting to be a default babysitter.\n\nThe public Facebook posts by the family member are definitely inconsiderate and could be seen as an overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for declining and standing up for their own plans. The key here is that the author had a right to their time and the family member's approach was inappropriate. So, the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
