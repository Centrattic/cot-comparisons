They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is visiting family for Christmas and has plans to relax. A family member's toddler needs care because the parent can't manage it and the MIL backed out. The author is asked indirectly, says no, and then gets messages and Facebook rants about it.\n\nKey points to consider: The author lives far away, only sees family a couple times a year, and had plans. They declined a direct request to care for the toddler, which the family member handled poorly by public shaming. The parent didn't ask the author themselves but had someone else do it. The author didn't go into the situation thinking they had to say yes, and they were clear about their plans.\n\nIs the author obligated to help? Since they're not the primary caregiver and it's an occasional visit, it's reasonable to prioritize their own plans. The parent's response was inappropriate, using public shaming and guilt-tripping, which isn't constructive. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially considering the family member's history of expecting others to be on call. The main issue here is the parent's handling of the situation, not the author's refusal. So, the answer should be B.\n"
