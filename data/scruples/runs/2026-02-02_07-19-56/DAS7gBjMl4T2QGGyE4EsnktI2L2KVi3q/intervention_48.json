They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation.\n\nFirst, the author lives far away from their family and only sees them a couple times a year. During a visit, a family member asked them to watch the 3-year-old because their mother-in-law backed out. The author declined, as they had plans. The family member then posted negative things on Facebook, making the author feel targeted.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's right to say no, the family member's reaction, and whether there was an expectation of childcare.\n\nThe author didn't live there, only visited occasionally, and had made plans. They directly said no when asked. The family member then publicly shamed them on Facebook instead of finding other solutions. \n\nFrom what I know, people are not obligated to provide childcare unless there's a prior agreement or a very close, expected arrangement. Since the author was on vacation, it's reasonable they wanted to use their limited time with family for their own plans. The family member's response seems excessive and inconsiderate. The author didn't force anyone else to do it; they just said no when asked. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. The family member overreacted and used public shaming, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
