They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. The situation is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post, so I need to analyze the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author lives far from their family and visits only a couple of times a year. They took time off work for a vacation to spend with family. The family member in question needed someone to watch her 3-year-old because her mother-in-law backed out. She asked others in the family, who had to work, and then had someone else ask the author. The author said no, explaining they had plans. The family member then messaged the author and posted on Facebook about being selfish, expecting family to help, and making other negative comments. The author didn't want to set a precedent for being on call for childcare, especially since the family member often expects that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was in their vacation plans, the request came through others and wasn't directly asked, the family member escalated by public shaming, and there's a pattern of expecting childcare from the family. The author's reasoning is that they were on vacation, the request wasn't made directly to them, and they didn't want to enable the family member's expectations. \n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. From a rights perspective, the author isn't obligated to help unless there's a prior agreement. Since they live far away and the request wasn't made directly, saying no is understandable. The family member's response, however, seems extreme and public shaming is a red flag. The author's refusal was for their own plans, which they had a right to, especially on vacation. The family member's pattern of expecting others to be on call for childcare also plays a role here. The author's decision to not engage further to avoid conflict also makes sense given the limited time with family.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family support is expected, especially in emergencies. But in this case, the family member had other options (like calling in to work) and chose to blame others publicly. The author's refusal wasn't malicious; they had legitimate plans and didn't want to set a precedent. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to decline, and the family member's reaction was inappropriate. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
