They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a different part of the country from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a Christmas visit, they had plans to relax and shop. A family member needed someone to watch her 3-year-old because her mother-in-law backed out and others were busy. The family member didn't ask the author directly but had someone else ask. The author said no because they had their own plans. Then the family member started sending messages and posting on Facebook, implying the author was selfish. The author didn't want to set a precedent and felt it wasn't their responsibility since they don't live there.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's right to their own time, the family member's approach (not asking directly, using intermediaries, then public shaming), and the fact that the author was on vacation. The author clearly communicated their refusal, so they aren't obligated to help. However, the family member's reaction is problematic. The author might be seen as selfish if they didn't offer to help, but given the circumstances and the other party's behavior, it's a judgment call.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider the balance of fairness and respect. The author had the right to say no, especially when they were visiting and had their own plans. The family member's response was inconsiderate and public, which is worse. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
