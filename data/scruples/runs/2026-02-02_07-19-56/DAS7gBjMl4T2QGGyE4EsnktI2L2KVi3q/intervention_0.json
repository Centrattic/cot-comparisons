They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining to babysit a family member's toddler during their vacation, and the family member responded with Facebook posts that were critical and accusatory.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author is in a different part of the country, visits a couple times a year. They took time off for Christmas. The family member needed childcare, but instead of asking the author directly, someone else asked. The author declined, then the family member posted harsh comments on Facebook. The author feels they were justified in saying no, especially because they don't live there and don't want to set a precedent.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's point is that they had plans and didn't feel obligated to change them. The family member, on the other hand, felt abandoned and used social media to express frustration. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, family support is often a given, but it's not a legal obligation. The author might argue that they weren't asked directly and that they have their own life. However, the family member might feel that in times of need, family should step up, especially during a holiday visit. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of direct communication from the family member, the author's clear refusal, and the public shaming via Facebook. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-centered, but they had the right to prioritize their own plans. The family member's reaction, however, is questionable\u2014public shaming is inconsiderate regardless of the situation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had the right to say no, but maybe the way the family member reacted is worse. But the question is about the author's actions. They didn't do anything illegal, but maybe they could have been more considerate. However, since they had plans and it's not a recurring issue, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to decline, especially since it wasn't their responsibility. The family member's response was inappropriate.\n"
