They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author was visiting family during Christmas and had plans. A family member asked through others to babysit her toddler, but the author didn't want to and said no. The family member then posted negative things on Facebook about the author. Now the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The family member needed childcare because her MIL backed out and others were working. The author was on vacation, which is a time to relax. The author had their own plans and didn't agree to the request. Did they have an obligation to help? Well, family situations can vary, but the author wasn't the one approached directly initially. The family member asked through others, not the author directly. Also, the author is not a regular caregiver since they live far away and only see family a couple times a year. That might mean there's no established expectation of regular childcare.\n\nThe author's refusal was straightforward. They didn't agree to watch the child and went about their plans. The family member's reaction seems extreme, using Facebook to vent and making it seem like others are selfish. That's a harsh response. The author might not be in the wrong for declining, especially since there's no precedent or clear expectation set that the author should be on call. The author also mentioned the family member often expects everyone to be available, which is a red flag for the family member's behavior, not the author's.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more considerate in their refusal. But given that the author was in their own vacation time, it's reasonable to prioritize their plans. The Facebook posts were public and harsh, which escalated the situation unnecessarily. The author's actions were a refusal, which is their right, even if it's inconvenient. The family member's reaction is the main issue here, not the author's decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
