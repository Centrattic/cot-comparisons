They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I\u2019d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. \n\nI was chilling at my parents\u2019 house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  \n\nThis family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn\u2019t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.  The next few hours I get messages like \n\n\u201cReally.  REALLY?!  You can\u2019t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t believe how selfish people are.\u201d  \u201cI have to call in to work because some people can\u2019t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don\u2019t get fired.\u201d \u201cWow.  Just wow.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d think family would be there for you.\u201d  \u201cMust be nice not to have any responsibilities.\u201d  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  \n\nIt was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of \u201cmust be nice\u201d type comments.  And I haven\u2019t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond \u201cyeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m selfish anyway so I guess what\u2019s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don\u2019t see my family often and I don\u2019t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody\u2019s brought it up to me.  \n\nAnyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn\u2019t want to.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don\u2019t even live there.  She\u2019s also really bad about expecting every family member to be free on call childcare...and tbh I don\u2019t want to set a precedent where she thinks she can rely on me when I\u2019m in town.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The person is asking if they're at fault for not babysitting a family member's toddler during their vacation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person is in a different part of the country from their family and visits a couple times a year. During a Christmas visit, they had planned to spend time with family and had taken time off work. A family member needed childcare but didn't directly ask the person; instead, others said no, and then she asked them. The person refused because they had plans. The family member then posted negative things on Facebook, and there's lingering tension.\n\nThe key points here are: The person didn't live there, the request wasn't made directly to them, they had their own plans, and the family member went to social media instead of finding another solution. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms and expectations. In some families, there's an expectation of helping out, especially with childcare. But the person here is far away and only visits occasionally. They had valid plans and didn't want to set a precedent for being on call. \n\nWas the person in the wrong to say no? Probably not. They aren't obligated to help, especially when the request wasn't direct. The family member's reaction was inappropriate, using Facebook to vent and implying others were selfish. The person's decision to not engage further to avoid conflict makes sense given the limited time with family.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to prioritize their own time, especially when the request wasn't made directly and there was no prior agreement. The family member's reaction is more problematic here.\n"
