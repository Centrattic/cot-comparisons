My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe woman is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends before. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. He reveals he's had multiple partners, including men. She's insecure because he was her first, and she's now disgusted by the thought of him being with men. She tries to talk to him about her feelings, but he yells, calls her a homophobic bitch, and says she should have kept it to herself. She's trying to address it through discussion or counseling, but he's pushing her away.\n\nFirst, internalized biphobia is a real issue. People can have biases they didn't realize they had. The woman is acknowledging her feelings, which is a step towards dealing with them. She's trying to be open and seek help, which is responsible.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction is problematic. Yelling, name-calling, and dismissing her feelings isn't healthy. He should be supportive, not confrontational. He's refusing to work on the issue together, which could harm their relationship. His response might be due to defensiveness or his own insecurities, but that doesn't justify his behavior.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She's honest about her feelings and wants to resolve them. Trying to communicate is a positive step. The boyfriend is at fault for his reaction. So the answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
