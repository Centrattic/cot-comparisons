My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young woman (18F) who is in a relationship with a bisexual boyfriend (23M). She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't had any sexual experiences with men beyond just kissing. When he reveals he's had \"much, MUCH further\" experiences with multiple men, including being a bottom, she feels disgusted and has been crying because she thought she was an ally to the LGBTQ community. She tried to discuss her feelings with him, but he got angry, called her a homophobic bitch, and said it was mean for her to bring it up, implying she should deal with it alone. She's now questioning if she's the asshole for bringing it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend had previously mentioned his bisexuality, so the author knew that. But she had her own assumptions about what that meant, which turned out to be incorrect. Now, she's struggling with her feelings of disgust and insecurity, possibly due to her own internalized biphobia. She's trying to process this by discussing it with him, which is important for communication in a relationship. However, he reacted negatively, which could be because he felt attacked or because he was sensitive about the topic. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's attempt to discuss her feelings, which is a valid and healthy approach in a relationship. 2) The boyfriend's reaction, which seems hostile and invalidating. 3) The mention of internalized biphobia, which is a real issue but might be causing her discomfort. 4) The author's insecurity about his past partners, which is a personal issue but can affect the relationship.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't being malicious. She's trying to address her feelings, which she acknowledges might stem from her own biases. The boyfriend's yelling and name-calling are clear signs of poor communication and a lack of support. Even if his past experiences were more extensive than she expected, it's his responsibility to handle the discussion with respect and understanding. \n\nThe boyfriend's insistence that she deal with it alone might be a form of gaslighting or dismissing her valid feelings. In a healthy relationship, both partners should work through issues together. The author's effort to seek counseling shows she's trying to resolve this constructively. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's taking responsibility for her feelings, communicating openly, and seeking solutions. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic here.\n"
