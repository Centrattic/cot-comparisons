My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. She's dealing with her internalized biphobia after finding out he's had relationships with men. She tried to discuss her feelings with him, but he reacted negatively, calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" and saying she shouldn't have told him. Now they're in conflict, and she's wondering if she's the one at fault.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n1. She's struggling with her own internalized biphobia, which is affecting her feelings towards her boyfriend.\n2. She tried to communicate her feelings to work through the issue.\n3. He reacted with anger and accused her of being homophobic, refusing to work on it together.\n4. She feels it's harming their relationship and is seeking support.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. When someone has internalized prejudices, even if they\u2019re not aware of them, it's a common human experience. The key here is whether she's acting in bad faith. She acknowledges her issue and wants to address it, which shows responsibility. Trying to discuss the problem is a reasonable step in a relationship to maintain honesty and work through issues.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction seems more problematic. He's dismissing her feelings, calling her derogatory names instead of engaging in a constructive conversation. Healthy relationships involve communication, empathy, and willingness to address each other's concerns. His refusal to seek couples counseling or work on it together could indicate a lack of support or understanding.\n\nInternalized homophobia or biphobia isn't something a person can immediately control. It's part of societal conditioning, and acknowledging it is the first step. The author isn't being intentionally hurtful; she's trying to process her feelings. The boyfriend's response of yelling and blaming her for being mean seems like an overreaction and not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her internal struggles. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of a problem in the relationship, such as poor conflict resolution or lack of emotional support.\n"
