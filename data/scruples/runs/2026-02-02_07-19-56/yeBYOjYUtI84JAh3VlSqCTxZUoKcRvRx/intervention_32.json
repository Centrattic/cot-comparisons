My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author (18F) is in a relationship with a 23M boyfriend who is bisexual. The boyfriend mentioned he's had multiple partners, including men. The author, who's an LGBTQ+ ally, suddenly feels disgusted and turned off by her boyfriend's bisexuality. She tried to talk to him about her feelings, but he got angry, called her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and said she shouldn't have told him. Now, she's questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. Let me break this down.\n\nThe key points here are communication and reactions. The author tried to address her feelings, which is a mature step. However, her feelings might stem from internalized biphobia, which she acknowledges. She's not opposed to her boyfriend's bisexuality in theory but is struggling with jealousy or discomfort now that it's personal.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and calling her names like \"homophobic bitch\" is not a healthy response. Even if his actions are hurtful, the author's intent was to communicate her feelings, which is generally the right approach in a relationship. \n\nHowever, there's a line between having personal biases and acting on them. The author is in a position as an ally but is struggling with her own biases. Is that her fault? It's possible she's dealing with something she didn't realize she had, so it's not entirely her fault. But she's aware now and is trying to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is definitely wrong. He should listen and support her instead of attacking her. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. She tried to communicate her feelings, which is good. Her feelings are real, even if they're problematic. So, is she at fault for having those feelings, or for trying to address them?\n\nIn relationships, discussing issues is important. The problem isn't the discussion itself but how both parties react. The author's intent was to resolve the issue, not to be hurtful. So maybe she's not the one in the wrong here. But she might need to work on her own biases, which is part of being an ally. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's handling of the situation is the main issue, not her bringing up the topic.\n"
