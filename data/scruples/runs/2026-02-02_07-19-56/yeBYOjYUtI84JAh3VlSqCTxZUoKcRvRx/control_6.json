My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with a partner, and the partner reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, the author is an 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a 23-year-old man who is bisexual. She knew he was bisexual but found out he had been with men more than she expected. She's feeling disgusted and turned off because of his past experiences, which she's realizing is internalized homophobia. She tried to talk about it, but he accused her of being homophobic and said she should have kept it to herself.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication and the partner's reaction. The author is trying to address her feelings, which is a healthy step in a relationship. She's being honest about her internal biases and wants to work through them, either alone or together. On the other hand, the boyfriend's response was to yell and dismiss her, which is not helpful. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to discuss her feelings? Probably not. It's important to communicate in a relationship to address issues. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning because he's not being supportive. The author isn't expressing hatred; she's acknowledging her own biases and wants to resolve them. The boyfriend's yelling and refusal to engage might indicate his own issues with the topic or a lack of understanding about how to handle such discussions.\n\nHowever, there might be nuances. Maybe the author approached the conversation in a way that made him defensive. But the post suggests she was trying to be open and honest. The boyfriend's response seems more like a personal attack than a constructive discussion.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to work through problems together. The author is taking a step towards that, while the boyfriend is retreating. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a good-faith effort to address her feelings and improve the relationship, whereas the boyfriend isn't being supportive.\n"
