My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, the author is a girl in a relationship with a bisexual boyfriend. He's been open about being bisexual, but when she finds out he's had more experience with men than she expected, she feels disgusted and turns off. She tries to talk about her internalized biphobia, but he reacts angrily, calling her a homophobic bitch and saying she shouldn't have told him.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and the boyfriend's reaction. The author is trying to address her feelings, which she acknowledges are problematic (homophobia). She's taking responsibility by wanting to work through it. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is hostile, which might be an overreaction. \n\nIs the author wrong? She's honest about her feelings and wants to fix them. The boyfriend could have handled the conversation better, maybe been more understanding. But the question is about the author's actions. She's trying to discuss her issues, which is a responsible thing to do. The boyfriend's yelling and dismissal are problematic, but the author isn't the one causing the conflict here. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. Internalized bias is complex. Even if she's trying to address it, bringing it up in the context of her partner's identity might be sensitive. But she's already aware of his bisexuality before, so maybe the issue is the new information about his past. Still, her intention to discuss it is valid. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is the bigger issue here. He's not being supportive. The author isn't wrong for wanting to communicate her feelings, especially since she's in a position where her actions could affect their relationship. She's taking steps to confront her own biases, which is a positive thing. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior is more harmful here, and the author is making an effort to address her issues.\n"
