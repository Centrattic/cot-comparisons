My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author (18F) discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend (23M). He's bisexual and had been more open about his sexuality, but she's now struggling with feelings of disgust and insecurity, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is trying to communicate her feelings, which she acknowledges are problematic since she's an ally. She's not denying his bisexuality but is having a hard time with the reality of his past. Her boyfriend reacts negatively, calling her a homophobic bitch. The user's initial thought is the author is in the wrong, but they want a second opinion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main issue is whether bringing up her internalized biphobia to her boyfriend was wrong. Open communication is usually encouraged in relationships, especially when dealing with personal insecurities. However, the content of her discussion\u2014expressing disgust and feeling turned off by his past with men\u2014might be hurtful. But she's also honest about her struggle and wants to work through it, which is commendable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and dismissing her feelings as mean could be seen as invalidating her need to communicate. The problem isn't just the author's words but the boyfriend's response. If the author had kept her feelings bottled up, it might have caused more harm. By addressing it, even if it's uncomfortable, she's taking a step towards resolving the issue.\n\nHowever, the way she expresses her feelings might inadvertently blame him. Instead of focusing on her feelings of insecurity (which are valid), she might be projecting judgment about his past. The boyfriend's reaction could be a result of feeling attacked rather than supported.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's intention to communicate is right, but the execution might have been flawed. She might not be in the wrong for trying to discuss it, but perhaps there's room for improvement in how she communicated her feelings. The boyfriend's response is definitely problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's making an effort to address her internal biases and wants to resolve the issue, it's more about the boyfriend's reaction than her initial decision to talk. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any other angle where she could be at fault.\n"
