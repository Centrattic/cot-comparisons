My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with a partner. The author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. She's upset because he's had many partners, including men, and she's feeling disgusted and turned off. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he got angry and accused her of being homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to be honest about her feelings and wants to address her internalized homophobia. She's taking responsibility by acknowledging her own biases and wants to work through them, either with counseling or on her own. That seems like a mature approach. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was yelling and being dismissive, which isn't helpful. He might feel that her bringing up these feelings is an attack on his identity.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She's not being homophobic; she's recognizing her own internalized biases. It's important in relationships to communicate feelings, even if they're uncomfortable. By discussing the issue, she's trying to improve the relationship and her own attitudes. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic because he's not engaging constructively. However, does that mean the author is in the wrong? Maybe not. She's trying to address her feelings, which is a positive step. The boyfriend's response is the issue here. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of insecurity from the author about his past partners. She's comparing herself to others, which is a common insecurity. But bringing up her feelings about his bisexuality might be conflating her general insecurity with her internalized homophobia. Still, she's attempting to address both issues by communicating. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she's not the one who's being homophobic. She's trying to confront her own biases. The boyfriend, by yelling and dismissing her, is not handling the situation well. So the problem lies more with his reaction than hers. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings, especially when she's taking accountability for her part. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
