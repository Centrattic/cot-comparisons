My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author is 18, and her boyfriend is 23. They've been dating for a while and were friends before. The boyfriend is bisexual, and he mentioned he's had multiple partners, including men. The author is feeling insecure because she's his first and only partner in many ways, and she's struggling with the idea of him being with men. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he reacted negatively, calling her homophobic and saying she shouldn't have brought it up.\n\nNow, internalized homophobia or biphobia is a real issue where someone who is LGBTQ+ might feel negative about their own sexuality. But in this case, the author is straight, so it's more about internalized biphobia towards her partner. She's trying to address her feelings openly, which is a mature approach. However, the boyfriend's reaction is harsh\u2014yelling, name-calling, and refusing to work through it together. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author is making an effort to communicate her feelings, which is healthy. 2) The boyfriend isn't being supportive and is invalidating her feelings. 3) The author wants to address the issue, showing self-awareness and a desire to improve the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is problematic because he's not engaging in the discussion constructively. He's dismissing her feelings instead of trying to understand them. The author isn't at fault for trying to discuss her insecurities, especially since she's aware that her feelings might stem from homophobia and is seeking help. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's taking responsibility and trying to resolve the issue, while the boyfriend is not being supportive. The problem lies more with his reaction than her initial decision to talk about it.\n"
