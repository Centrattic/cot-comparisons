My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl who's dealing with internalized biphobia after finding out her boyfriend is bisexual and has had many partners. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he got angry and said she was a homophobic bitch. Now she's questioning herself if she was wrong to bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address her own feelings of discomfort, which she recognizes as internalized homophobia. That takes courage and self-awareness. The boyfriend, on the other hand, reacted with anger and accused her of being homophobic. His reaction seems harsh, especially since he's the one who initiated the conversation about his past. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author felt the need to discuss her feelings because she realized they were affecting their relationship. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger issues, so initiating the conversation was responsible. However, the boyfriend's response was dismissive and hostile, which is not a constructive way to handle such sensitive topics. \n\nAnother aspect is the boyfriend's history. He had previously mentioned being bisexual but didn't go into details. When he later revealed more, it might have triggered the author's insecurities. The fact that he has a large number of partners could be a separate issue, but the author is specifically addressing her reaction to his bisexuality. \n\nThe boyfriend's accusation of homophobia is a serious one. However, the author's actions\u2014trying to discuss her feelings and seek help\u2014indicate a willingness to confront her biases. His reaction of yelling and saying she should have stayed silent seems to be a refusal to engage constructively. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to handle conflicts with empathy and openness. The author's intention was to work through her feelings, which is a healthy approach. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and his hostile response are problematic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The real issue is the boyfriend's reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
