My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 18, their boyfriend is 23. They've been friends first, then dating. The boyfriend is bisexual, and the author knew he was bi but thought he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. Later, he reveals he's been with multiple men. The author is struggling with feeling disgusted and being turned off by the thought of him with men. They tried to talk about it, but the boyfriend reacted angrily, calling them a homophobic bitch. The author is trying to work through their feelings, maybe through counseling, but the boyfriend is upset they brought it up.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is dealing with their own internalized biphobia, which is causing them emotional distress. They tried to communicate their feelings, which is generally a good practice in relationships. However, the boyfriend reacted negatively, possibly because he felt attacked or misunderstood. \n\nIs the author wrong for discussing their feelings? Well, in a healthy relationship, partners should be able to talk about their emotions. The author isn't being homophobic intentionally; they're trying to address their own issues. The problem is that the boyfriend's reaction was harsh, which might indicate he's not open to discussing this. But the author's action of initiating the conversation isn't wrong per se. They're trying to be honest and work on the problem. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. If the author's feelings are based on discomfort with his bisexuality, could that be problematic? But the author is clearly recognizing their own internalized bias and is seeking help, which shows they're not intentionally being bigoted. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling judged, but the author's intention is to resolve the issue. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author's action of communicating their feelings is wrong. Since they're taking responsibility and trying to address it, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic, but the question is about the author. They're not the asshole here for trying to discuss their feelings. The boyfriend's response was more hostile and not supportive, which is an issue on his end.\n"
