My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. Later, he reveals he's had multiple partners, including men. The author, who considers herself an LGBTQ+ ally, is now turned off by the thought of him with men, leading to emotional distress. She tried to discuss her feelings with him, but he reacted angrily, calling her homophobic and saying she shouldn't have brought it up. Now she's questioning if she's the asshole for initiating the conversation.\n\nFirst, the author's intention to discuss her feelings is positive. Bottling them up could harm the relationship. She acknowledges her own internalized biphobia, which is a self-aware step. Her approach was to communicate and seek help, which is healthy in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and calling her names are not constructive responses. He dismissing her need to work through this together and instead placing blame on her is problematic. Healthy communication requires both parties to listen and support each other, not to attack.\n\nThe core issue is the boyfriend's inability to handle the discussion, not the author bringing up the topic. She's dealing with insecurity and internalized biases, which are personal struggles, but sharing them with her partner is part of working through them. The boyfriend's refusal to engage in couples counseling and his hostile reaction indicate a lack of emotional support.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address her feelings. The boyfriend's response is the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
