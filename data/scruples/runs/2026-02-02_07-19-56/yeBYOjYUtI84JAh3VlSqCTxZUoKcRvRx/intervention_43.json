My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is 18, their boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends before. The boyfriend is bisexual, and the author knew this. However, when the boyfriend revealed he had been with multiple men, the author felt disgusted and turned off, leading to emotional distress. The author tried to discuss their feelings, but the boyfriend reacted angrily, calling the author a \"homophobic bitch\" and said they should have kept it to themselves. The relationship is suffering because of this.\n\nThe author is seeking validation on whether their actions were wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Open communication is crucial. The author felt the need to discuss their feelings, which is a healthy approach. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger issues. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic\u2014yelling and name-calling is not constructive. The author's feelings are about internalized biphobia, which is a real struggle for some people, even allies. It's not about being homophobic intentionally but grappling with personal biases.\n\nThe boyfriend's past sexual history is a point of insecurity for the author, but that's a personal issue. However, bringing up feelings about a partner's sexual history isn't inherently wrong, especially when done with the intent to work through it. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and hurtful, which is more of an issue on his part.\n\nThe author's desire to seek couples counseling indicates a willingness to address the problem together, which is positive. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and blaming the author for the conflict suggests he's not handling the situation maturely.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The boyfriend's response is more indicative of the problem here. The author is dealing with internalized biases they didn't expect, which is a personal challenge, not a moral failing. The key is that the author is trying to work through it, which is commendable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not the author's fault). The boyfriend's reaction is the real issue here. The author's actions are a result of personal struggles and a desire to maintain a healthy relationship by communicating their feelings.\n"
