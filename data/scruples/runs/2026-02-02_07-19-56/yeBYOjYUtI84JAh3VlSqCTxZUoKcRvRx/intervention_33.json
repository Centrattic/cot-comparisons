My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves discussing internalized biphobia with her boyfriend, who is bisexual. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author, an 18-year-old girl, is in a relationship with her 23-year-old boyfriend. He's been friends with her for a long time and they became a couple. He's bisexual and had mentioned being into men, but she thought he hadn't gone beyond kissing. Then he tells her he's been with multiple men and has over 70 sexual partners (20 with men). She's feeling insecure because she's his first and only in many ways, and now she's disgusted when thinking about him with men. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he yelled and called her homophobic. She wants to work through it with counseling, but he says it's her issue to deal with.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious what I think. The answer needs to be A (yes) or B (no). Let me analyze. \n\nThe author's main issue is internalized biphobia. She acknowledges that she's an ally and is upset that her own biases are causing her to feel disgusted. She tried to communicate her feelings to her boyfriend, which is a good step. However, the boyfriend reacted negatively, which is problematic. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, she's dealing with her own internal biases, which she's trying to address. Her reaction is based on her personal feelings and past experiences (being his first, etc.), not on his identity. She's taking steps to address it, which shows she's not intentionally being homophobic. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and refusing to engage is more of an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate, even if the boyfriend didn't handle it well. Her feelings are valid in the sense that she's struggling with her insecurities, which could be related to her own issues rather than his bisexuality itself. However, the fact that she's projecting her insecurities onto his past might be a problem. But since she's actively trying to work through it, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is definitely wrong, but the question is about the author. She's not being intentionally homophobic; she's dealing with internalized bias. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
