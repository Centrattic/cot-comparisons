My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends before. He's bisexual and had mentioned he'd only kissed people before, but later revealed he's had sexual relationships with men. The author is struggling with her own feelings of disgust and insecurity because he's had many partners, including men. She tried to talk about it, but he got angry and accused her of being homophobic. Now she's seeking validation on whether she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here: She's trying to address her internalized biphobia, which is causing her discomfort. She approached him to discuss it, but he reacted negatively. The question is whether her action of bringing up the issue makes her the asshole.\n\nInternalized biphobia is a real issue where someone, despite being allies, might have subconscious biases against bisexuality. The author is acknowledging her own biases, which shows self-awareness. The act of discussing these feelings with a partner is a valid step towards addressing them. Open communication in a relationship is generally encouraged, especially when there are personal issues that affect the relationship.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction\u2014yelling and calling her a \"homophobic bitch\"\u2014seems extreme and dismissive. He's not engaging constructively with her feelings but instead attacking her. This kind of reaction can be hurtful and counterproductive. The fact that he's unwilling to seek couples counseling or work through the issue together might indicate a problem on his part. \n\nThe author isn't denying his bisexuality or attacking his identity. She's struggling with her own feelings but is trying to address them. The boyfriend's unwillingness to listen and his harsh judgment could be a bigger issue than her initial attempt to communicate. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to be open to discussion and empathy. The author's intentions are to improve their relationship, not to criticize her partner's identity. Her boyfriend's response of anger and deflection might be more indicative of his own issues, perhaps insecurity or inability to handle vulnerability. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole here. She's taking responsibility for her feelings and seeking a solution. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she acted with good intentions and tried to communicate, she's not in the wrong. Answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
