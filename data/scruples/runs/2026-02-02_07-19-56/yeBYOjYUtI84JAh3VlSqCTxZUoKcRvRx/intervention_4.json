My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. The boyfriend had previously mentioned being bisexual but implied he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. Later, he reveals he's had multiple partners, including men. The author then feels disgusted and turns off by the thought of him with men, which contradicts her self-identification as an LGBTQ ally. She tries to talk about her feelings, but he reacts angrily, calls her a homophobic bitch, and refuses to work on it together.\n\nThe author is worried she's the asshole (AITA) for bringing up her internalized biases. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. So, the author's intention was to address her feelings and seek support. But when she brought it up, the boyfriend reacted poorly, which is understandable if he felt attacked. However, the boyfriend's response was harsh. He dismissed her feelings and blamed her for bringing it up, which isn't helpful. But does that mean the author was wrong to discuss it?\n\nInternalized homophobia or biphobia is a real issue, and it's brave to confront it. By trying to communicate, the author is taking responsibility for her feelings instead of letting them fester. The problem arises in how the boyfriend reacted, but the act of seeking help and being honest isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's response is more concerning because he didn't engage in a constructive way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She had a valid reason to express her feelings, especially since they were affecting their relationship. The issue is more on the boyfriend for not being supportive and for yelling. The author's actions were about addressing a personal struggle, not attacking his sexuality. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
