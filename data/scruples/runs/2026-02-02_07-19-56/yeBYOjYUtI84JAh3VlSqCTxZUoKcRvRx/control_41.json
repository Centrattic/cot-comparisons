My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with her boyfriend. She's 18, he's 23. They've been dating and were friends before. He's bisexual and has had multiple partners, which she's struggling with, especially the number and the fact that he's bottomed with men while being dominant with her. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he reacted negatively, calling her homophobic. She feels bad and wants to work through it, but he's upset she brought it up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is at fault. Internalized biphobia is a real issue where someone who is part of the LGBTQ+ community holds negative beliefs about their own orientation, often leading to self-hatred or prejudice. The author is experiencing this, which is a personal struggle. She's trying to address it by discussing it with her boyfriend, which is a reasonable step. She's not being homophobic towards others; it's about her own internal conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" is not constructive. Even though she's his partner, his response of yelling and refusing to engage might be part of the problem. Relationships require communication and support, especially when dealing with personal issues. If he's unwilling to talk or seek help, that could be his issue. \n\nThe key points here are that the author is making an effort to address her feelings, which is healthy. She's not denying his bisexuality or attacking him; she's dealing with her own insecurities. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and his hostile reaction are problematic. However, is the author in the wrong for bringing up the topic? Probably not. It's important to communicate feelings in a relationship. She's trying to be transparent and seek solutions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's taking a responsible step to address her internalized issues, and the boyfriend's reaction is the main issue here. Her intentions are good, and she's not being discriminatory towards others but dealing with her own internal conflict.\n"
