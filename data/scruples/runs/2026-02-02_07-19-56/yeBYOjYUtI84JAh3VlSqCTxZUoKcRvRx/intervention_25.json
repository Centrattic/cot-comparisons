My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with her boyfriend. The key points here are communication, the boyfriend's reaction, and the emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the author tried to talk about her feelings. She's struggling with homophobia creeping in, even though she considers herself an ally. She approached her boyfriend to discuss it, which seems responsible because she wants to address the issue instead of bottling it up. \n\nBut her boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and calling her names. That's a big red flag. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other through tough conversations. His reaction might stem from his own insecurities or a feeling that she's judged him, but his response was unhelpful and hurtful. \n\nThe author's intention was to seek help and work through her feelings, possibly through counseling. That shows she's trying to improve the relationship. However, the boyfriend's refusal to engage and his accusation that she's the problem could indicate a lack of emotional support in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be projecting her insecurities onto the relationship. Her discomfort with his bisexuality and past experiences could be influencing her feelings. But even if that's the case, bringing it up is important to address, and her approach was to communicate, which is correct. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The boyfriend's reaction is clearly problematic. He dismissed her feelings and refused to work on it. The author isn't wrong for trying to communicate. Her feelings, while uncomfortable, are valid and worth addressing. Internalized biases are hard to overcome, and seeking help is the right step. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's response is the issue here.\n"
