My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends before. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't been with men beyond kissing. Then he tells her he's had multiple partners, including men, and she starts feeling disgusted. She tries to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he yells at her, calls her homophobic, and says she should've kept it to herself. Now she's questioning if she's the asshole for bringing it up.\n\nSo, the key points here. The woman is struggling with her own biases she didn't expect to have. She's trying to be open and discuss it because she loves him. But her boyfriend reacts angrily, invalidating her feelings. He didn't support her in working through this issue, which could be a problem for their relationship.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's trying to communicate her feelings, which is generally a healthy approach. Bottling things up can lead to bigger issues, so bringing it up makes sense. However, internalized prejudice is a personal struggle. But she's not the one actively being homophobic; she's trying to address her own feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh and dismissive. Yelling and calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" is not constructive. He should be supportive and maybe seek counseling if needed. \n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for trying to discuss her internalized biphobia. I don't think so. She's taking responsibility for her feelings and wants to work through them. The real issue might be his reaction\u2014his inability to handle her vulnerability and his own defensiveness. So the answer is probably B (she's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe some could argue that she should've handled it differently, but the main problem is his response. She's taking the right step by addressing it, so AITA answer would be B.\n"
