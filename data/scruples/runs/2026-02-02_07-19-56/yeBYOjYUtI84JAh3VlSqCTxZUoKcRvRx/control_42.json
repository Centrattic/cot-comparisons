My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 18-year-old girl in a relationship with a boyfriend who is 23 and bisexual. They were friends first, and he mentioned he's been with men before, which the author found unsettling. She tried to talk about her internalized biphobia, but he got angry and accused her of being mean for bringing it up. Now she's feeling guilty and he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address her own feelings, which she acknowledges are problematic (internalized biphobia). She's in a relationship and wants to work through this. She didn't hide her feelings but tried to discuss them, which is a good step. Her boyfriend's reaction was harsh\u2014calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" and saying she shouldn't have mentioned it. That seems like an unhealthy response. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling judged or defensive. He might have felt that her bringing up his past was an issue, but the way he responded was aggressive. The author's intention was to be honest and seek help, which is a responsible approach. However, the boyfriend's refusal to engage and his harsh words could be the bigger problem here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. She's not denying her feelings or being homophobic; she's trying to address internalized biases. Her action was to communicate, which is generally a positive step in relationships. The boyfriend's response was to attack her, which is more harmful. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. The key issue is the boyfriend's reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
