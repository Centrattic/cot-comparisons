My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. The situation involves the author, a 18-year-old female, and her boyfriend, a 23-year-old male. They've been dating and were friends before. The boyfriend is bisexual and had more sexual experiences, which the author is struggling with. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is her internalized biphobia. She's feeling disgusted and turned off because her boyfriend is bisexual, which contradicts her self-image as an LGBTQ ally. She tried to communicate her feelings because she wants to work through it, either together or with counseling. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and accuse her of being homophobic, and he's now distancing himself.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are her intent to discuss her feelings, which is a healthy step in any relationship. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger issues, so communication is usually encouraged. However, the problem might be how she communicated it. Did she approach it with honesty about her feelings without making him feel blamed? The question is whether her actions were wrong in bringing up her insecurities.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction is also important. His response was hostile, which could indicate he didn't handle the conversation well. But the question is about the author's actions. Since she was trying to address her own internal biases and not to attack him, her intent was positive. She's in a vulnerable position, dealing with her own feelings, and wants to resolve them. The boyfriend's reaction might be part of the problem, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for expressing her feelings honestly.\n\nInternalized biases are real and can affect people regardless of their awareness. The author is taking responsibility by acknowledging her feelings and wanting to address them. The boyfriend's response of yelling and calling her names is unhelpful, but the author's action of initiating the discussion isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
