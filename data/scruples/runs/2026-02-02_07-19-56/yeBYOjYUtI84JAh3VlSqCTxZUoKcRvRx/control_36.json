My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 18-year-old female who's dating a 23-year-old bisexual male. They were friends before dating. The boyfriend reveals he's had sexual encounters with men, which the author finds difficult to accept. She admits to feeling disgust and being turned off, which she attributes to internalized homophobia. She tries to talk about it, but the boyfriend reacts angrily, calling her a homophobic bitch and saying she should have kept it to herself. Now she's confused because she's an LGBTQ+ ally and feels bad about her reaction.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. She's trying to address her feelings openly, which is important in a relationship. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger problems. She approached the conversation with the intention to work through it, either together or through counseling. Her feelings are real, even if they're based on internalized biases. It's not her fault to have those biases; they're societal. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and dismissing her feelings as homophobic without understanding the root cause isn't constructive. He should be supportive and willing to work through it, but he's cutting her off, which could harm the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's response might be a reaction to feeling judged or defensive, but he shouldn't attack her. The fact that she's an ally online suggests she's not intentionally homophobic. Her issue is internalized, not active hatred. So, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. The problem lies more with how the boyfriend handled it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
