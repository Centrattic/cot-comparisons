My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a relationship where the boyfriend is bisexual, and the author is dealing with internalized biphobia. The key points here are the author's feelings of disgust and insecurity, the boyfriend's negative reaction, and the communication breakdown.\n\nFirst, the author tried to discuss their feelings, which is a positive step towards addressing issues in the relationship. It's important to acknowledge that opening up about such personal issues requires vulnerability, especially when it involves prejudice one isn't proud of. The fact that the author recognized their own homophobia and wanted to address it shows self-awareness and a desire to grow, which is commendable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was hostile\u2014he yelled and accused the author of being a \"homophobic bitch.\" This kind of response is counterproductive and harmful. Healthy communication in a relationship should involve listening and understanding, not defensiveness. His refusal to engage in couples counseling or work through the issue together suggests a lack of willingness to support his partner's growth and address the relationship's problems.\n\nThe author's insecurity about the partner's number of previous partners is also a valid feeling, though it's important to recognize that everyone has different thresholds for what they can handle in a relationship. The author isn't wrong for feeling insecure; however, the way these feelings manifest can affect the relationship dynamics. The key here is that the author is making an effort to confront their internalized biases, which is a responsible action.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention to communicate their feelings and seek help is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's hostile response is the issue here. The author isn't the asshole for trying to address their feelings and work on the relationship. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
