My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old girl in a relationship with a 23-year-old boyfriend who is bisexual. They were friends first, and she knew he was bisexually oriented but thought he hadn't been physically intimate with men. Then he tells her that he has had multiple partners, including men, and that he's had over 70 partners total, with 20 being men. The author is feeling insecure because he was her first and she's now comparing herself to all those other people. She also mentions she's an LGBTQ ally but now she's feeling disgusted when he initiates intimacy and is struggling with her internalized biphobia. She tried to talk to him about her feelings, but he got angry, called her a homophobic bitch, and said she shouldn't have brought it up. Now they're in conflict, and she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's consider her actions. She tried to communicate her feelings, which is generally a healthy approach in relationships. She's honest about her internalized biases, which is a sign of self-awareness. However, she's struggling with feelings of jealousy and disgust. But she's not wrong for feeling that way; people can have valid emotions even if they are based on internalized biases. The key here is whether she acted inconsiderately.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend reacted with anger and insulted her. His response was not constructive. He didn't engage in a discussion or seek to understand her feelings. Instead, he dismissed her and blamed her for bringing it up. That's a problem because healthy communication is essential in any relationship. If he's truly in a relationship with someone who's bisexual, he should be open to discussing any concerns they have, especially since she's making an effort to address her own biases.\n\nThe author tried to initiate a discussion to work through her feelings, which is a responsible thing to do. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling her names is the real issue here. He's not taking her feelings seriously. The fact that he's unwilling to seek counseling or work through it together also suggests he's not being supportive.\n\nIn terms of being an ally, the author is trying to confront her biases, which is commendable. It's possible to support the LGBTQ community and still have personal issues to work through. The fact that she's trying to address them is a positive step. The boyfriend's response is more about defensiveness and not about solving the problem.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. The wrongdoing is on the boyfriend's side for his hostile reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
