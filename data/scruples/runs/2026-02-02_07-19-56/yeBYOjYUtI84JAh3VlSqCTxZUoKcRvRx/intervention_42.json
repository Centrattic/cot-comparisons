My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a 18-year-old girl in a relationship with a 23-year-old boyfriend. He's bisexual and has had many sexual partners, including men. The author is struggling with internalized biphobia, feeling disgusted when thinking about her boyfriend with men. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he reacted angrily, calling her homophobic. Now she's confused if she did the right thing by opening up.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and emotional response. The author came forward to talk about her feelings, which is a responsible move. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger issues. She's trying to address her internal biases, which shows self-awareness. However, she's feeling turned off by his past experiences, which is a personal reaction but not her fault entirely.\n\nHer boyfriend, on the other hand, responded with anger and accusations. That's a problem because a healthy relationship should involve support, not yelling. His reaction might stem from defensiveness but is still harmful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's trying to work through her feelings and is seeking help, her intention is positive. The issue is more on his side for not supporting her and escalating the situation. However, her feelings themselves aren't wrong; it's about how they're handled. She's not at fault for having internalized biphobia; it's a personal struggle. The wrong lies in how he responded, not her initial decision to communicate.\n"
