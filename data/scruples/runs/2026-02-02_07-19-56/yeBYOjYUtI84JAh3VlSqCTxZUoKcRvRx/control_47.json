My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl who's dating a bisexual guy, and when she finds out he's had more sexual experiences with men than she thought, she starts feeling disgusted. She tries to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he yells at her and says she's a homophobic bitch, and now he's not wanting to work on it together.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address her own feelings. She mentions she's an ally and is upset that she's feeling this way. She's not being homophobic towards her boyfriend personally; she's struggling with her own biases. It's important to note that having internalized homophobia doesn't make someone a bad person, but it's something they need to work on. Her intention to discuss it shows she wants to be better and improve the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and calling her names is not constructive. Healthy relationships involve communication and support, not blame. He might also have his own issues with how his experiences are affecting her, but his response was to shut her down instead of addressing the problem together. The author didn't do anything wrong by trying to communicate her feelings. She's taking responsibility and wants to resolve it, which is the right approach. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
