My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the girl) is in the wrong for discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe girl is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends first. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it. Then he told her he's been with multiple men, over 70 partners total, which makes her insecure because he was her first in everything. She's feeling disgusted now when he tries to be intimate, thinking about him with men. She's trying to address this because she's an LGBTQ+ ally but feels homophobia creeping in. She tried to talk to him, but he yelled at her, called her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and wants her to deal with it alone. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she's confronting her own internalized biphobia, trying to communicate her feelings, which is important in a relationship. Her boyfriend's reaction is to yell and accuse her instead of supporting her. She wants to work through it together, but he's rejecting that.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's being honest about her feelings. Even if the feelings are uncomfortable, expressing them is necessary for a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's response is the problem here\u2014he's not being supportive. She's not attacking him for being bisexual; she's struggling with her own biases. So, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. She's trying to address her own issues, which is good. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively is the issue. So the blame is on him, not her.\n"
