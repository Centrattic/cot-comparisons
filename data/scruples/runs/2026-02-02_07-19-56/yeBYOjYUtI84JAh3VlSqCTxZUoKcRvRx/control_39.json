My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's a woman, is in a relationship with her boyfriend who's bisexual. She knew he was bisexual before they started dating, but he mentioned he hadn't gone beyond kissing. Then he told her he's had more serious relationships with men, which made her feel disgusted and turned off. She tried to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he got angry and accused her of being homophobic. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address her feelings. She's not denying her boyfriend's identity; instead, she's acknowledging that she has internalized homophobia, which is affecting her. She's reaching out to him to work through this, which is a responsible approach. It's important in relationships to communicate feelings, even the uncomfortable ones. So her initial action of trying to discuss it might not be wrong.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend's reaction. He yelled at her, called her a homophobic bitch, and said she should have kept it to herself. That's pretty harsh. His response seems dismissive and hostile instead of being supportive. He might be feeling defensive or hurt, but yelling and rejecting her attempts to communicate isn't healthy. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel safe to express their feelings without fear of judgment or retaliation.\n\nThe author's intention was to address her feelings so they can work through the problem together. She's not trying to invalidate his bisexuality but is dealing with her own internal biases. It's possible she's not at fault here because she's taking steps to self-reflect and improve. However, maybe she could have approached the conversation differently? But the problem here is more about his reaction than her initial attempt to communicate.\n\nAlso, internalized homophobia is something a person can struggle with, and it's not uncommon. The key is addressing it, which she's trying to do. Her boyfriend's refusal to engage and his hostile response are problematic. He's not taking responsibility for his part in the conversation. Maybe he's hurt that she's projecting her insecurities onto him, but that's not an excuse for his behavior.\n\nSo putting this together, the author tried to communicate her feelings constructively. Her boyfriend's reaction was inappropriate and harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
