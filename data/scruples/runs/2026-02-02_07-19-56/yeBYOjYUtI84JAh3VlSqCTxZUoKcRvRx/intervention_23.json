My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a girl in a relationship with a bisexual man. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it. Then he tells her he's been with many people, including men. She's insecure because he's her first and she can't handle the number of his past partners. She also feels disgusted and finds it weird that he's a bottom when he's dominant in their relationship. She tries to talk to him about her feelings, but he yells at her, calls her homophobic, and says she should've kept it to herself. Now the relationship is suffering because he won't work through it with her.\n\nFirst, the author tried to communicate her feelings. Open communication is usually a good thing in relationships. She felt her internalized biphobia was causing issues, so she wanted to address it. That's brave and responsible. But her partner reacted poorly. He yelled and accused her of being homophobic. His reaction seems unhelpful and maybe even hurtful. He dismissed her feelings and didn't want to work through it together.\n\nThe key points here are: She tried to discuss her feelings, which is the right approach. He responded with anger and defensiveness. His reaction is not constructive. The author isn't denying her feelings but is trying to confront them. The fact that she's crying and struggling shows she's taking it seriously. His response invalidates her and blames her for bringing it up. That's not a healthy way to handle such issues.\n\nHowever, maybe there's something else. Is her reaction justified? She's feeling disgust, which could be a sign of internalized homophobia. She's aware of that and is trying to address it. But could her partner's behavior have contributed to her feelings? Maybe his past actions made her uncomfortable, but that's her to work through. However, she's trying to do that, and he's being uncooperative.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to handle such issues with support. If he yells and refuses to engage, that's his part in the problem. The author isn't the one refusing to work on the relationship. She's open to counseling, which shows willingness to fix things. His refusal to engage is more problematic. So, the author's wrongness would depend on her actions. Did she do something to deserve the reaction? She's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings. He is in the wrong for his hostile response. Therefore, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
