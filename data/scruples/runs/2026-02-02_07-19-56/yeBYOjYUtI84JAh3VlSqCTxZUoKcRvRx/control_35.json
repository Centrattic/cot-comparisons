My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether the person who wrote this is at fault for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is a 18-year-old female in a relationship with a 23-year-old male who is bisexual. He came out as being more experienced with relationships, including with men. The author had internalized biphobia, which she realized after he shared more details about his past. She felt disgusted and now has trouble being intimate because she's thinking about him with men. She tried to talk to her boyfriend about her feelings, but he reacted negatively, calling her homophobic and saying she shouldn't have brought it up. Now, he's upset and the relationship is strained.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is trying to address her own feelings of insecurity and internalized bias. She's not being homophobic towards her boyfriend; instead, her own internalized biases are causing her discomfort. She's honest about her feelings and wants to work through them. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling and dismissing her efforts to communicate. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is usually encouraged. The author isn't attacking her boyfriend's sexuality; she's acknowledging her own issues and seeking help. His response of anger and refusal to engage might be the bigger problem here. So, the author isn't wrong for trying to discuss her feelings, especially since she's making an effort to address them constructively. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be the issue, not her decision to communicate. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
