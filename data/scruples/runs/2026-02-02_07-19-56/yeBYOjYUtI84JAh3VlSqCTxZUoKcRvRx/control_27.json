My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girl who's in a relationship with a bisexual guy. She knew he was bisexual, but when he told her he's been with men multiple times, she got really uncomfortable. She feels disgusted now and can't be intimate with him because she's thinking about him with other men. She tried to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he got angry and called her a homophobic bitch, saying she shouldn't have brought it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's right and wrong here. The author is trying to address her feelings, which is a mature thing to do. She's acknowledging her own biases and trying to discuss them. That seems like a good step towards self-improvement and maintaining a healthy relationship. On the other hand, her boyfriend reacted with anger and hostility instead of empathy. That's a problem because communication is crucial in relationships, especially when discussing sensitive issues.\n\nBut wait, is she in the wrong for having these feelings? Internalized homophobia or biphobia is a real thing. People can have biases they're not even aware of. The fact that she's recognizing this and trying to address it shows growth. She's not acting on her feelings in a harmful way towards others; she's just struggling with her own emotions. So, is it her fault that she has these internalized feelings, or is it about how she handled it?\n\nShe did approach him to talk about it, which is the right thing. The problem lies in how he responded. He should have been supportive and maybe sought counseling together. His reaction of yelling and blaming her seems more harmful. The key point here is whether she's at fault for expressing her feelings honestly. Since she's trying to resolve the issue, not hurt him, I don't think she's the asshole here. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning because he dismissed her feelings and attacked her instead of working through the problem.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
