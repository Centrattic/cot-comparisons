My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is an 18-year-old girl in a relationship with a 23-year-old bisexual boyfriend. They had been friends before, and the boyfriend had mentioned he was bisexual but implied he hadn't been with men beyond makeout sessions. Then, he reveals he's actually been with multiple men, over 70 partners total, 20 of which were men. The author is feeling insecure because he was her first and only, and she's struggling with her internalized biphobia. She tried to talk to him about her feelings, but he got angry, called her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and said she should have kept it to herself. Now, they're arguing about whether she was wrong to bring it up, and the author is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication, personal biases, and the boyfriend's reaction. The author tried to discuss her feelings, which is a positive step in a healthy relationship. She acknowledges her own internalized biphobia, which is a sign of self-awareness. However, the boyfriend reacted with yelling and defensiveness, which isn't helpful. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, she was honest about her feelings. Even though her reaction stems from insecurity and internalized homophobia, she's trying to address it. The boyfriend being in the relationship should be willing to listen and support her, even if he's upset. That said, maybe the way she brought it up could have been better? But the main issue seems to be that the boyfriend refused to engage and instead blamed her for being mean. \n\nIn relationships, communication is essential. If she's feeling this way, bringing it up is necessary to work through it. The boyfriend's response was harsh and dismissive. So, it's possible that the boyfriend is at fault for not being open to discussion. The author is not in the wrong for trying to address her feelings. She's taking responsibility and wants to resolve it. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's fault for having these feelings in the first place? It's important to note that internalized biphobia is something that can happen even to allies. It's not entirely her fault, but she's trying to work on it. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling her names is definitely a problem. He should have handled it with more empathy. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making an effort to communicate and address her biases. The boyfriend's response is the main issue here. The author isn't the asshole for trying to discuss her feelings, even if they stem from internalized prejudice.\n"
