My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18F) discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend (23M), who is bisexual and has had many partners. The key points are:\n\n1. The author tried to communicate her feelings of disgust and discomfort after learning about her boyfriend's bisexuality and sexual history. She's upset because these feelings contradict her self-identification as an LGBTQ+ ally.\n2. The boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling at her and calling her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and now refuses to work through the issue together.\n3. The author wants to address this through couples counseling or other means, but the boyfriend is dismissive.\n\nNow, evaluating who is in the wrong. The author is taking a proactive step to address her feelings, which is generally healthy. She's not blaming her partner but acknowledging her own internal biases. Her intention is to resolve the issue and improve the relationship, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. Yelling and using derogatory language isn't constructive. If he truly cares about the relationship, he should be supportive and willing to work through these issues together. Dismissing her efforts to communicate and refusing counseling could harm the relationship further.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual effort. If the author's feelings are causing significant distress, it's valid to express them. The boyfriend's refusal to engage in solutions is a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking to address her internalized bias, especially when it's affecting their relationship. The boyfriend's response seems more harmful than the author's initial discussion. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
