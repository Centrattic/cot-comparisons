My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old girl in a relationship with a 23-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a while and were friends before. The boyfriend is bisexual and had mentioned before he hadn't gone beyond kissing with men, but later reveals he's had multiple partners, including over 20 men. The author, who considers herself an LGBTQ+ ally, suddenly feels disgusted, has trouble being intimate, and starts crying. She tries to discuss her feelings with him, but he yells, calls her homophobic, and says she shouldn't have brought it up. Now the relationship is suffering, and she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. First, the author's actions: she tried to communicate her feelings because she felt they were internalized biphobia. She's aware of her own biases and wants to work through it. That seems responsible. She's not in denial; she's trying to address it. But her boyfriend reacted poorly. He was defensive, yelled, and dismissed her feelings. That's a bad response. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other through such challenges.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems invalidating. Instead of listening and working together, he blamed her. The author's insecurity about the number of partners might be part of it, but it's not her fault for feeling that way. People have different comfort levels, and it's important to address them. However, the way the boyfriend responded is definitely a problem.\n\nIs the author wrong? She tried to communicate. That's a good step. But maybe she could have approached it differently? Or maybe not. Given the situation, she's in a vulnerable spot. The key issue here is the boyfriend's reaction. He's not taking accountability and is making her feel like she's at fault. The author isn't the asshole here. The boyfriend is being defensive and not supporting her through her internal struggles.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's trying to work through her feelings, which is the right approach. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic.\n"
