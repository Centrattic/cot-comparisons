My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a woman (18F) and her boyfriend (23M) who is bisexual. The key points are:\n\n1. The boyfriend is open about being bisexual but had previously suggested he hadn't done more than make out with men. Later, he reveals he's had multiple partners, including over 20 men. The author feels insecure because he was her first and she's jealous of his number of past partners.\n\n2. The author, who identifies as an LGBTQ ally, suddenly feels disgusted when thinking about her boyfriend's past. She's having a hard time with the idea of him being a bottom in relationships, which is different from his dominant role with her. She tried to discuss her feelings, but her boyfriend reacted angrily, calling her a homophobic bitch and saying she shouldn't have brought it up. Now he's distancing her, and their relationship is suffering.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to analyze this carefully.\n\nFirst, the author tried to communicate her feelings, which is generally a good step in a relationship. She's honest about her insecurities and internalized homophobia, which she's trying to address. Her boyfriend's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling and accusing her of homophobia. That seems like a problem. Relationships require support and understanding, and his reaction might be dismissive or invalidating.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings about her partner's past and his bisexuality need to be considered. She's feeling disgust and discomfort, which could be a sign of internalized homophobia. Her intention to work through it, even if through counseling, is positive. But does she have the right to feel this way? People can have jealousy and insecurities regardless of their beliefs. The issue is how she's handling it versus the validity of her feelings.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction is definitely a problem. Dismissing her feelings and calling her names is not constructive. If he truly wants to be in a healthy relationship, he should be supportive and willing to work through her issues, not push her away. However, the author did bring up sensitive topics that might make him uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean she was wrong to express her feelings. She's not trying to hurt him but to address her own internalized prejudices.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's disgust and the fact that she's having trouble coping might be problematic. But given that she's trying to confront and resolve these feelings, that's a positive step. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively suggests he's not handling the situation well either.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. Since she's making an effort to address her internalized homophobia and is seeking help, it's more about her personal growth. Her boyfriend's reaction is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
