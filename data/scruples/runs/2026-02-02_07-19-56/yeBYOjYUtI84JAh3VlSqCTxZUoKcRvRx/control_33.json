My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about internalized biphobia. The author is a woman in her teens with a bisexual boyfriend who's older. They were friends first, but now there's tension because she's feeling disgusted when thinking about him being with men. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he got angry and said she was a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is struggling with her own internalized biphobia, which is causing her discomfort. She's trying to communicate her feelings, which is generally a good thing in a relationship. However, her boyfriend reacted negatively, calling her names and not being open to discussion. \n\nInternalized homophobia or biphobia can be really challenging, especially if someone is an ally otherwise. The fact that she's trying to address it shows self-awareness. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for bringing it up. Relationships require communication, so wanting to talk about this is valid. However, the way she approached it might matter. Did she express her feelings without blaming him? The story says she tried to discuss it, but he took it as an attack. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems problematic. Yelling and name-calling isn't healthy. He's dismissing her feelings and not being supportive. The fact that he has a lot of sexual partners might contribute to her insecurity, but that's his side. She's not in the wrong for feeling this way; internalized biases can be unconscious. However, acting on those feelings by being turned off or not wanting to be intimate is an issue. But the main question is about being in the wrong for discussing it.\n\nThe author isn't being intentionally homophobic. She's trying to work through her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of a problem in handling communication. So, the answer would be B (No), because she's making an effort to address her feelings and seek help, which is the right approach. The blame shouldn't be on her for having internalized biases but trying to fix them, especially when communication is key in relationships.\n"
