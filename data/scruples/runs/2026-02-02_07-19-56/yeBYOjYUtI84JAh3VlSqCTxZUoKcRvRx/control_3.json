My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author (18F) discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend (23M), who is bisexual. He became upset and accused her of being homophobic. The author is seeking validation and wants to address the issue but feels her boyfriend isn't supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is trying to confront her feelings, which is a positive step. She's aware of her internalized homophobia and wants to work through it, showing self-awareness. She approached her boyfriend to discuss this, which is important in a relationship to maintain trust and understanding. However, her boyfriend reacted negatively, calling her names and refusing to engage, which is problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is a significant factor here. His yelling and refusal to seek help or communicate constructively could be seen as dismissive and harmful. The author is not the one being hostile; she's trying to address an issue that's affecting her emotionally. The fact that she's willing to work on it through counseling indicates she's proactive about the relationship's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to engage and his hostile response might indicate his own issues, possibly defensiveness or lack of understanding of the situation. The author's actions stem from wanting to resolve her feelings rather than being intentionally hurtful. \n\nIt's important to consider that acknowledging and addressing one's biases is a personal growth step, which the author is attempting. The boyfriend's reaction might be a barrier to that growth. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings, especially when she's already in a vulnerable position. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), as the author is not the asshole. She's taking responsibility for her feelings and seeking a solution, whereas the boyfriend's reaction is counterproductive. The key is that the author's intent is positive, and communication is healthy even if it leads to conflict. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
