My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a girlfriend) is in the wrong for trying to discuss her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend. The situation involves her boyfriend revealing he's had multiple partners, including men, which made her feel disgusted and led to conflict when she tried to talk about her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They were friends first. She's an LGBTQ+ ally but now feels homophobia creeping in after learning about his bisexuality. She tried to discuss this, but he yelled at her and accused her of being homophobic, saying she should have kept it to herself. She wants to work through it together or in counseling, but he's pushing her to deal with it alone.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, the main issue here is the conflict between her desire to address her feelings and his reaction. Internalized prejudice is a real struggle, and seeking support to overcome it is reasonable. By bringing up her feelings, she's being honest and trying to maintain the relationship healthily. He, on the other hand, reacted with anger and defensiveness, which isn't helpful. His reaction might stem from feeling attacked or defensive about his sexuality, but his response was harmful.\n\nThe author's intention to communicate is generally positive. It's important to address issues in a relationship rather than suppress them. However, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. Yelling and dismissing her feelings is not a constructive way to handle the situation. The fact that she wants to work through it together shows she's trying to be proactive.\n\nBut wait, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since she's the one who initiated the conversation to address her own internalized feelings, she's acting out of a place of wanting to improve herself and the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of the problem here. The author isn't being homophobic in her actions; she's acknowledging her biases and seeking help. Therefore, she's not the one in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
