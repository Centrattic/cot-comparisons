My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's in a relationship with her boyfriend who's bisexual. She's been trying to discuss her internalized biphobia with him, but he got really upset, called her a homophobic bitch, and now she's wondering if she did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. She's 18, he's 23. They were friends before dating. She knew he was bisexual but thought he'd only kissed men. He later tells her he's had sexual experiences with men. She's insecure because he has many partners, including 20 men, and she's now feeling disgusted. She tried to talk to him about her feelings, but he reacted negatively, yelling at her. She wants to work through it together or with counseling, but he says she should handle it alone. The question is whether she's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, from what I know about relationships and communication, it's usually healthy to address issues rather than bottle them up. Internalized homophobia is a real thing, especially for someone who's an ally but has subconscious biases. When she tried to discuss it, he responded with anger and blame, which isn't constructive. He called her names and shut down the conversation, which is a problem. His reaction could be due to feeling attacked or defensive, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.\n\nShe's taking responsibility by acknowledging her feelings and wanting to work through them. That's proactive. He's not open to that, which might be his issue. However, bringing up sensitive topics can sometimes be tough. But in this case, she's trying to be honest about her internal struggles, which is important for the relationship's health. It's not about being wrong or right, but about how both parties handle the situation. Her intention was to communicate and improve the relationship, which is generally the right approach.\n\nHe's the one who reacted with hostility, which can be damaging. So while she might have initiated the topic, his response is what's problematic. She's not in the wrong for wanting to address her feelings and seeking help. The boyfriend's reaction is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
