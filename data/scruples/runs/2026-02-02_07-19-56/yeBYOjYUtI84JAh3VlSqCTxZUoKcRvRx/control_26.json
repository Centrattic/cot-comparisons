My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girl (18F) and her boyfriend (23M) who is bisexual. She's struggling with her internalized biphobia after finding out he's had relationships with men. She tried to discuss her feelings with him, but he got angry and yelled at her, calling her a homophobic bitch. Now she's wondering if she was in the wrong for bringing up the issue.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is at fault. The key points here are about communication in a relationship and dealing with personal insecurities. The author tried to express her feelings, which is generally considered healthy in a relationship. She didn't hide her emotions and wanted to work through them, either together or through counseling. However, her boyfriend reacted negatively, which might indicate that he's not handling the situation well.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Internalized biphobia is a real issue, and people can have unconscious biases they need to address. The fact that she's trying to confront her feelings shows self-awareness and a desire to improve. She didn't act out in anger or make accusations, just shared her feelings. Her boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and harmful, as he's not supporting her efforts to address the problem. He's dismissing her need to communicate and is placing blame on her instead of working together.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. The author did the right thing by addressing her feelings instead of keeping them bottled up. The boyfriend's response\u2014yelling, name-calling, and refusing to engage constructively\u2014is more indicative of a problem. So, the blame here isn't on the author for trying to discuss her internal struggles. The issue lies more with the boyfriend's reaction and lack of support.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
