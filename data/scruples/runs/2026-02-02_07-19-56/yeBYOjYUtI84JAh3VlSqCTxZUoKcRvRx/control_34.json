My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18F) and her boyfriend (23M), who is bisexual. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author knew her boyfriend was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. He later reveals he's been with multiple men. She's feeling disgusted and turned off, which she attributes to internalized biphobia. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he responded with anger, called her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and now says she shouldn't have told him. She wants to work through this together, but he's pushing her to deal with it alone.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's consider. The author tried to communicate her feelings as they came up, which is generally healthy in a relationship. She expressed her internal discomfort, which she's aware is due to her own biases. Her intention was to address the issue rather than hide it. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He called her names and invalidated her feelings. His reaction might stem from feeling attacked or defensive, but yelling and labeling her as homophobic is not constructive. He has a history of being open about his sexuality, so it's possible he expected the author to accept it without question.\n\nThe author's insecurities about his number of partners might also play a role. It's not uncommon to feel that way in a relationship, especially if one partner is more experienced. However, her disgust specifically towards his past with men points to internalized biphobia, which she's trying to address. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The author did the right thing by initiating communication. The boyfriend's response was inappropriate. However, the author's feelings themselves aren't inherently wrong, but they need to be addressed. The key here is that the boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and hurtful, which suggests he's not engaging in the conversation constructively. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's trying to address her own biases and communicate openly, the answer is likely B (No). The boyfriend's harsh response is more indicative of the problem here. The author isn't wrong for wanting to work through her feelings; the real issue is how the boyfriend is handling the situation. So, the answer should be B.\n"
