My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a 23-year-old bisexual man. She's known he's bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. Then he reveals he's been with multiple men and has over 70 partners. The author starts feeling disgusted and turned off, leading to emotional distress. She tries to talk about her feelings, but he yells at her, calls her homophobic, and says she should've kept it to herself. Now the relationship is strained.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication in relationships and handling internal biases. The author is struggling with her own internalized biphobia, which she didn't realize she had until this situation. She's trying to address it by discussing it, which is a responsible approach. However, her partner reacts negatively, invalidating her feelings and not being open to support or counseling. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, wanting to address one's own biases and discussing them in a relationship is a healthy step. The problem here seems to stem from the partner's reaction, not the author's intent. She's not being intentionally homophobic; she's trying to work through her feelings. The boyfriend's response is dismissive and hurtful, which likely contributes to the conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that bringing up such personal feelings in a relationship can be challenging and needs careful handling. But given that she's aware of her biases and wants to address them, her approach is proactive. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively is problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. The issue lies in the partner's reaction and unwillingness to communicate effectively. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
