My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a relationship where the girlfriend is struggling with internalized biphobia when she finds out her boyfriend is bisexual and has had many partners. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he got angry and said she shouldn't have brought it up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 18, and her boyfriend is 23. They were friends before dating. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it beyond kissing. Now she's upset that he's had multiple partners, including men. She's feeling disgusted and finds it hard to be intimate. She tried to talk about it, but he accused her of being homophobic and said she should've kept it to herself.\n\nSo, the question is: Is she the asshole? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points to consider here are about communication in a relationship and dealing with personal biases. The author is trying to address her own internalized biphobia, which she acknowledges is a problem. She's not rejecting her boyfriend's identity but is struggling with her feelings of disgust. She's taking responsibility by saying she's an ally but has these feelings, which she's trying to address. She's reaching out for support, which is a healthy step.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is to yell and accuse her of being homophobic and mean. His response is dismissive and not supportive. In a healthy relationship, partners should be able to discuss sensitive topics without fear of being attacked. His reaction might be due to his own insecurities or a desire to avoid dealing with the issue, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. It's important in a relationship to address issues that affect both partners. The boyfriend's response is the problem here. The fact that he's unwilling to engage in couples counseling or work through the issue together shows a lack of willingness to support her. The author's actions are reasonable given her desire to improve the relationship and herself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
