My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend, who is bisexual. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a 18-year-old female, her boyfriend is 23 and bisexual. They were friends before dating. The boyfriend mentioned he's been with over 70 partners, including 20 men. The author is struggling with jealousy and disgust, even though she considers herself an LGBTQ+ ally. She approached her boyfriend to discuss her feelings, but he reacted negatively, yelling at her and saying she's a homophobic bitch. She feels it's important to address this, either together or through counseling, but he refuses and says she should deal with it alone. She's questioning if she's the asshole (ITA) for bringing up the issue.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for discussing her internalized biphobia. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author is acknowledging her own biases and trying to communicate them to her partner. That seems like a responsible approach. She's not blaming him but taking responsibility for her feelings. Internalized homophobia is a real issue that people in the LGBTQ+ community, including allies, can face. It's not uncommon for people to have internal conflicts, especially when their personal experiences or upbringing conflict with their values.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, however, seems problematic. He's not engaging constructively, instead attacking her and shutting down communication. His response of yelling and calling her names isn't healthy, especially in a situation where the author is trying to address an issue that's affecting their relationship. He's dismissing her feelings and refusing to seek help, which could indicate he's not ready to work through the problem.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel safe to express their feelings without fear of judgment or retaliation. The fact that the author is reaching out to discuss this shows she's trying to be honest and improve the relationship. The boyfriend's refusal to address it together or consider counseling might be a bigger issue here. He's not taking her feelings seriously and is instead placing blame on her for having them.\n\nSo, looking at both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The problem lies more with how the boyfriend reacted. She's not being homophobic; she's confronting her own internalized issues. It's important to address these feelings to maintain a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
