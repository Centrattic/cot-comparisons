My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. She tried to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he got angry and told her she was a homophobic bitch. She's upset because she wants to work through this with him or through counseling, but he's not willing. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author is trying to address her own feelings of discomfort, which she recognizes as internalized biphobia. She's being honest about her feelings with her partner, which is a good communication step. However, the boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and dismissing her feelings. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's not denying his bisexuality; she's acknowledging it and trying to deal with her own reactions. She's taking responsibility by wanting to work through this, which is proactive. On the other hand, holding some insecurity about his number of partners might be a personal issue, but it's not uncommon in relationships. The problem here is the boyfriend's reaction. He should be supportive, not attacking her for being honest. \n\nThe author is in a difficult position because she's trying to address her own biases, which is commendable. Her intention is to improve the relationship by discussing the issue. The boyfriend's response is the bigger problem here\u2014his yelling and refusal to engage in solutions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a genuine effort to address her feelings and the relationship's health. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue. The fact that she's seeking help and communication shows she's trying, which is the right approach. The wrong here is more on the boyfriend for his reaction.\n"
