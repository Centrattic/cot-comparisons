My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's struggling with her internalized biphobia after finding out her boyfriend is bisexual and has had many partners, including men. She tried to discuss her feelings with him, but he got angry and accused her of being homophobic. Now they're in a conflict, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author (18F) is in a relationship with a 23M boyfriend who's bisexual. He told her he's had many partners, including men, which made her feel disgusted and turned off. She tried to discuss this, but he reacted negatively. She's seeking advice on whether she's at fault.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the main issue here is about internalized homophobia. The author is aware of her own biases and is trying to address them by discussing it with her partner. That seems proactive and responsible. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger problems, so initiating a conversation is a valid approach in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction is concerning. He called her names and refused to engage, which isn't healthy. It's important to consider both sides. The author's feelings are real and she's trying to work through them. On the other hand, bringing up these feelings in a constructive way is important, but if the partner isn't receptive, it might not be effective.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. She didn't do anything inherently wrong by expressing her feelings. She's taking responsibility for her internal biases and wants to address them. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own potential defensiveness or lack of communication skills. \n\nThe author's intention to seek counseling shows she's trying to resolve the issue. The boyfriend dismissing her and calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" is a hostile response. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel safe to discuss their feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong for initiating the conversation. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
