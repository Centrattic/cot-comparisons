My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man, dealing with internalized biphobia after learning about his past relationships with men.\n\nFirst, the author approached her boyfriend to discuss her feelings. That seems reasonable because she recognized her own biases and wanted to address them rather than keeping them bottled up. It's important to communicate in a relationship, especially when dealing with personal issues that affect the partnership.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend reacted negatively, calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" and accusing her of being mean. His reaction seems harsh and dismissive. Instead of engaging in a constructive conversation, he shut down the discussion. Healthy relationships require both partners to listen and support each other, even when the conversation is difficult.\n\nThe author's feelings stem from her own internalized biphobia, which is a common issue even among allies. She's trying to confront her biases, which is a positive step. The boyfriend's unwillingness to address this together, instead telling her to deal with it alone, could be a problem. His response might be a defense mechanism, but it's not helpful.\n\nThe key points here are communication and support. The author did the right thing by trying to discuss her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is the main issue here. He should have been more understanding and open to working through this together. So, the author isn't in the wrong for initiating the conversation; the issue lies with the boyfriend's response.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her feelings and seeking help, which is appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem, not her decision to communicate.\n"
