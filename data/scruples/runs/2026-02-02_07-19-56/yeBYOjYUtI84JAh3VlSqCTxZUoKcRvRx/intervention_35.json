My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (18F) is in a relationship with her boyfriend (23M) who is bisexual. They've been friends a while and are now dating. The boyfriend mentions he's been with multiple men, which the author finds hard to handle. She's insecure because he's her first and only partner, and he has over 70 partners, including 20 men. She's an LGBTQ+ ally but feels disgusted when thinking about him with men. She tried to talk about her internalized biphobia, but he yelled at her and said she's homophobic. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my input. Let's break this down. The key points are: 1) The author is struggling with internalized biphobia despite being an ally. 2) She tried to communicate her feelings, which is a good step. 3) The boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and not supporting her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, trying to communicate her feelings isn't inherently wrong. People have different levels of comfort with their partner's past, and it's valid to feel insecure. However, the author's reaction is based on internalized biphobia, which she's aware of. It's important to address, but that doesn't mean she's wrong for reaching out. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is problematic. He labeled her a homophobe without understanding her internal struggle. Healthy relationships require support and discussion, not yelling and shutting down. The author's intention to work through it together is positive. The boyfriend's refusal to engage in couples counseling or discuss it together is a red flag. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address her feelings. The problem lies in the boyfriend's reaction. But the question is whether she's the asshole. The author is taking a step to address her internal biases, which is commendable. The boyfriend's response was unkind and dismissive. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
