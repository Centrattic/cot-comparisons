My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a girl, is in a relationship with her boyfriend who is bisexual. She finds out he's had many partners, including multiple men, which makes her feel disgusted and she's having trouble dealing with it. She tried to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he got angry and accused her of being homophobic. Now she's confused if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address her feelings, which are likely rooted in her own insecurities and maybe societal influences. She acknowledges her internalized biphobia, which is a valid issue many people struggle with, even if they're allies. By bringing it up, she's being honest about her feelings, which is generally seen as healthy in a relationship. Communication is key in relationships, so trying to discuss the issue seems right.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. He yelled at her and called her names, which isn't a constructive way to handle conflicts. His response shuts down any possibility of working through the issue together, which isn't helpful. He's suggesting she deal with it alone, but if the problem is affecting their relationship, both should be involved in resolving it. His behavior could be seen as dismissive and not supportive.\n\nThe author's intentions are to improve the relationship by addressing her feelings, not to attack or judge her partner. She's taking responsibility for her emotions and wants to work on them, which is a mature approach. However, the boyfriend's reaction is making the situation worse. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The main issues here are the boyfriend's negative response and unwillingness to engage. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
