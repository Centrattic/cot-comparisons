My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They were friends before dating. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't acted on it. Then he tells her he's had relationships with men, over 20 partners. She's feeling disgusted and turned off because of this. She tried to talk to him about her feelings, but he yelled at her, called her a homophobic bitch, and said she should've kept it to herself. Now the relationship is suffering because of this.\n\nThe key points here are: She's trying to be honest about her feelings, which she recognizes as internalized biphobia. She's trying to address it because she loves him and wants to work through it. His reaction was hostile, which might be part of the problem. \n\nIs she in the wrong for bringing up her feelings? Generally, communication is important in relationships. If someone is struggling with certain emotions, especially ones they're trying to acknowledge (like internalized bias), it's reasonable to discuss them. She didn't attack him for being bisexual; she's addressing her own feelings. \n\nHowever, maybe she could've approached it differently? But the problem is his reaction. He dismissed her feelings and didn't support her efforts to resolve the issue. In that case, he might be the one in the wrong by not being understanding. \n\nInternalized biases are hard to deal with, and she's taking responsibility by wanting to work through it. The boyfriend's response seems to be invalidating her feelings instead of supporting her. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
