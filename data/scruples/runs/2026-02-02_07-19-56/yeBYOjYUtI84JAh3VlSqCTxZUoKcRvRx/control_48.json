My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. She knew he was bisexual but didn't know the extent. When he disclosed having been with multiple men, she felt disgusted and her feelings turned off. She tried to discuss her internalized biphobia with him, but he reacted angrily, called her a homophobic bitch, and said she should have kept it to herself. Now she's struggling with insecurity and wants to work through it, but he's pushing her away.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: She approached him about her feelings, which is a healthy step in a relationship. Internalized biases can affect anyone, and seeking to address them shows self-awareness. She's not blaming him but taking responsibility for her feelings. That's maturity.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend reacted with yelling and invalidation. His response was hostile and dismissive, which can be harmful. He's not engaging in the conversation constructively. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for initiating the discussion. But bringing up uncomfortable topics in a relationship isn't the fault of the person who's trying to communicate. The issue here seems to be his reaction, not her initiative to discuss. She's trying to work through her feelings, which is the right approach. He's the one not being supportive, which is a problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her intention to discuss her internalized bias is valid and responsible. The boyfriend's reaction is the problematic part here.\n"
