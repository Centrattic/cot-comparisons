My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author, a woman, is dealing with internalized biphobia after finding out her boyfriend is bisexual and has had multiple partners, including men. She tried to discuss her feelings with him, but he accused her of being homophobic and said she shouldn't have brought it up. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is struggling with her own feelings of disgust and discomfort, which she acknowledges might be internalized homophobia. She's trying to be honest about her feelings and wants to work through them, either with her partner or through counseling. On the other hand, her boyfriend reacted with anger, called her a homophobic bitch, and is now distancing himself from the conversation. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author tried to address her feelings openly, which is generally healthy in a relationship. Bottling up emotions can lead to bigger issues later. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and dismissive. Instead of engaging in a constructive conversation, he's doubling down on blame, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe author's intention was to communicate her internal struggles, not to attack or judge her partner's identity. Internalized biphobia isn't something she can control, and trying to discuss it shows self-awareness and a desire to grow. The boyfriend's immediate reaction of anger and dismissal might be because he feels attacked, but his response isn't productive. \n\nIn relationships, when one partner has issues that affect the relationship, it's important for both to work through them. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and his harsh words could be contributing to the relationship's decline. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to address her feelings; she's taking a responsible step towards resolving potential issues. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the number of partners. The author feels insecure about the 70+ partners, which is a valid feeling, but that's a separate issue from the biphobia. The key here is that she's honest about her feelings and is seeking to resolve them, which is a positive step. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that his identity is being judged, but his response isn't helping. It's possible he's also dealing with his own insecurities or feelings of betrayal, but that doesn't justify his harsh response. \n\nIn conclusion, the author tried to communicate and is seeking a solution, which is a healthy approach. The boyfriend's reaction is unhelpful and potentially damaging. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
