My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend (18F) who's dealing with her own internalized biphobia after finding out her boyfriend (23M) is bisexual. He mentioned he's had over 70 partners, 20 with men, and she's feeling disgusted and turned off now. She tried to talk to him, but he yelled at her and called her a homophobic bitch. Now they're struggling in their relationship, and she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is trying to address her own feelings, which are based on internalized biphobia. She's an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, so she's aware of this and is trying to confront her own biases. She approached her boyfriend to discuss this, which is a valid step in working through her emotions. However, he reacted negatively, which complicates things.\n\nInternalized homophobia/biphobia is a common issue, even among allies. The fact that she recognizes her feelings and wants to discuss them shows self-awareness and a desire to improve the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and accusing her of being homophobic is problematic. It's not healthy to dismiss someone's emotions, especially when they're trying to be vulnerable and work through their issues. His response might indicate that he's not open to dialogue, which is a red flag.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. She's not being malicious; she's trying to address her internal conflict. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not being supportive and is invalidating her emotions. So, the responsibility isn't entirely on her. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). She's not the asshole here because she's taking a proactive and honest approach to her feelings. Even though the discussion led to conflict, the root issue is her internalized bias, and confronting it is a positive step. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of a problem in the relationship, like poor communication or lack of emotional support. The fact that he's unwilling to work on it together suggests that he's not handling the situation well, which might mean the author is not the one at fault for initiating the conversation.\n"
