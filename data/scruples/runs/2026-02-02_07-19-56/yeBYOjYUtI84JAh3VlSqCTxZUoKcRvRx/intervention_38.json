My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, an 18-year-old girl, is dating a 23-year-old guy who is bisexual. They had been friends before, and she knew he was bisexual but he said he hadn't gone further than kissing. Later, he tells her he's had multiple partners, including men. Now, she's feeling disgusted when thinking about him with men, which makes her uncomfortable during their relationship. She tried to talk to him about her internalized biphobia, but he yelled at her and said she was being mean for bringing it up. She's questioning if she's in the wrong for discussing her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. It's generally important to talk about feelings, even if they're uncomfortable. The author tried to address her insecurities, which is proactive. However, she's experiencing internalized biphobia, which is a real issue. The problem is whether bringing this up was appropriate. Since she loves him and wants to work through it, her intention seems good.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend reacted negatively, calling her homophobic and saying she shouldn't have brought it up. His reaction might stem from feeling criticized or hurt, but yelling and dismissing her feelings isn't helpful. His response could indicate that he's not open to discussing the issue, which might be a bigger problem in the relationship.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid because internalized homophobia can affect even allies. She's struggling with her own biases, which she recognizes and is trying to address. The fact that she's in a relationship with someone who is part of the LGBTQ+ community and still faces personal conflicts shows she's working on herself.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. Dismissing her feelings and escalating the situation by yelling isn't healthy. He should have listened and tried to understand her perspective instead of attacking her. The key here is mutual respect and support in a relationship. If he's unwilling to engage in counseling or discuss the issue, that's a red flag.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction and refusal to engage are more concerning. The question is whether the author's action of discussing her feelings is wrong. Since open communication is encouraged, even if it's difficult, she's probably not in the wrong. The bigger issue is the boyfriend's response. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
