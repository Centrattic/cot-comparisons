My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a woman who's in a relationship with a bisexual man. She knew he was bisexual but didn't realize he had been physically intimate with men. When he told her, she felt disgust and found it hard to be intimate with him. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he got angry and accused her of being a homophobic bitch. Now she's feeling guilty and wants to work through it, but he's cutting her off.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: She tried to communicate her feelings. That's a good step in relationships. She's struggling with her internalized biphobia, which she didn't expect. She's insecure about his past relationships, which is a valid emotion. She's trying to address it, not hide it. So her intent is to work through the issue, not attack him.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction: He yelled and accused her of being homophobic. Even if she has biases, he shouldn't have dismissed her feelings like that. He's not helping the situation by being defensive. Also, his argument that she shouldn't have told him is problematic because communication is key in relationships. If you can't talk about issues, how can you resolve them?\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. She's not attacking his identity; she's struggling with her own feelings. Internalized prejudice is a real thing. She's trying to deal with it, which shows self-awareness. He's not supporting her in that. He's lashing out, which could be a red flag for how he handles conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). It's important to address feelings in a relationship, even if they're uncomfortable. The boyfriend's response is more harmful. The author is taking the right step to confront her biases, which is healthier for the relationship in the long run. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and his harsh reaction are the real issues here.\n"
