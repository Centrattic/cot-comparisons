My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girl is struggling with her internalized biphobia after finding out her boyfriend is bisexual and has had many partners, including men. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he reacted negatively, calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" and saying she should have kept it to herself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girl is dealing with insecurity, especially since he was her first and she's now his 70th or so partner. Her disgust might stem from jealousy or internalized homophobia. She's trying to address her feelings and is reaching out for help, which seems like a good step. However, she's projecting her discomfort onto her boyfriend's sexuality, which isn't fair. Her actions might not justify his reaction, but she's still trying to communicate her emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is pretty harsh. Yelling and calling her names isn't a healthy way to handle the situation. He's dismissing her attempt to work through her feelings and isn't offering support. His behavior is definitely problematic. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong. She did the right thing by trying to discuss her feelings instead of bottling them up. However, her feelings might be influenced by homophobia, which she's aware of and is trying to address. But just because she has internalized biphobia doesn't mean she's automatically in the wrong for expressing her feelings. She's trying to work on it, which is positive. The main issue is that her feelings are causing her to have a negative reaction to her boyfriend's sexuality, which is something she needs to reflect on. However, her intention to communicate is correct. \n\nBut does her reaction itself make her the asshole? Maybe she's struggling with her own biases, but she's not expressing hate; she's expressing personal discomfort. Her boyfriend's reaction is worse, but the question is about her. She's not in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. The boyfriend is in the wrong for his harsh reaction. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
