My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl who's dealing with internalized biphobia after finding out her boyfriend is bisexual and has had relationships with men. She tried to talk about it, but he got angry and said she was a homophobic bitch, and now things are breaking down.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 18, and her boyfriend is 23. They were friends before dating. He was open about being bisexual but hadn't acted on it until now. She feels disgusted when thinking about him with men, which is internalized homophobia. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he reacted negatively, yelling and telling her to deal with it alone. She's trying to work through it with counseling but he's not open to that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's actions: she's trying to be honest and work through her feelings. That's a positive step. She's not blaming him for being bisexual but is struggling with her own feelings. Her boyfriend's reaction is problematic\u2014yelling, calling her names, and refusing to engage. His response is hostile and dismissive, which isn't healthy. The author's intent is to communicate and fix the issue, which is right. The boyfriend isn't being supportive.\n\nInternalized homophobia is a real struggle, especially for someone who's an ally but still has subconscious biases. The fact that she's acknowledging it and trying to address it shows maturity. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning because he's invalidating her feelings and not being open to help. In a relationship, both partners should support each other through challenges. His refusal to engage in counseling or discuss the issue makes him the one acting inconsiderately.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The real issue is the boyfriend's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
