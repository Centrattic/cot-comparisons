My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, their boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends before. The boyfriend is bisexual and had been in relationships with men, including sexual encounters. The author is struggling with internalized biphobia, feeling disgusted when thinking about the boyfriend's past. They tried to discuss their feelings, but the boyfriend reacted angrily, called them names, and said they should have kept it to themselves.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: they wanted to address their feelings to work through the issue, which is a healthy approach. They didn't hide their feelings but tried to communicate. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and labeling them as homophobic without understanding their struggle might be an overreaction. The author is trying to be honest and seek help, which is reasonable.\n\nInternalized biphobia is a real issue, and the author is taking responsibility by acknowledging it. They're not attacking the boyfriend's identity but their own feelings. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and dismissal could be part of the problem. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one partner shuts down communication, that's a problem. The author isn't wrong for trying to address their feelings, especially when it's affecting their relationship. The boyfriend's response is more concerning here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's reaction is more at fault, and the author is making a valid attempt to resolve their internal conflict.\n"
