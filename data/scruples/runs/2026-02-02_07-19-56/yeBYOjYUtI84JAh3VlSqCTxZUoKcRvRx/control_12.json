My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author, a woman, is experiencing internalized biphobia after learning her boyfriend is bisexual. The boyfriend reacted negatively when she tried to discuss her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is open about her insecurities, especially about his number of past partners. She feels disgusted and turned off because he's had relationships with men, which surprises her because she's an LGBTQ+ ally. She tried to talk about it, but he yelled at her, called her homophobic, and said she should have kept it to herself. \n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and respect. The author is taking a proactive step by trying to discuss her feelings, which is a healthy approach in a relationship. It's important to address issues that affect both partners. However, the boyfriend's reaction is aggressive and dismissive. He's not engaging the discussion constructively. \n\nInternalized homophobia or biphobia is a real issue, and the author is recognizing her own feelings and seeking help. That's not something to be ashamed of. The boyfriend's response, labeling her as a \"homophobic bitch,\" is invalidating and harmful. He's not supporting her through her struggles, which is a critical part of being in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's insistence that she deal with it alone and his resentment over her honesty could be problematic. Healthy relationships require mutual support and understanding. By not allowing open discussion, he's not contributing to resolving the issue. The author's intention to work through it together is positive, while his reaction is toxic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's attempting to address her feelings in a constructive way. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
