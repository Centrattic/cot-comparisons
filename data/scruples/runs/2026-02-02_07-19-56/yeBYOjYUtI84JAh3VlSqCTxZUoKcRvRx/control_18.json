My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend after learning he's had multiple male partners. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author approached her boyfriend about her feelings, which she realized were rooted in her own insecurities and internalized prejudices. She felt disgusted and was struggling with the idea of him being with men, which conflicts with her self-identification as an LGBTQ+ ally. She tried to communicate her feelings, but he reacted negatively, calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" and ending the discussion.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are: \n1. The author's intent was to address her feelings in a healthy way by discussing them with her partner. This is generally a responsible action in a relationship, as open communication is key. \n2. Her boyfriend's reaction was hostile and dismissive, which might indicate he didn't handle the situation well. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the issue. \n3. The author is experiencing internalized biphobia, which is a legitimate psychological challenge. Her desire to work through this with her partner or through counseling shows she's trying to resolve it constructively.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's response: yelling and refusing to engage further might stem from feeling attacked or defensive. However, the author's action of initiating the conversation was an attempt to be transparent and seek support, which is not inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn relationships, discussing personal insecurities and mental health is important for both partners. The fact that the author felt the need to address her feelings instead of repressing them isn't a fault. The boyfriend's unwillingness to work through it together is also an issue, but the focus here is on the author's responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction and refusal to address the issue are the problematic parts here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
