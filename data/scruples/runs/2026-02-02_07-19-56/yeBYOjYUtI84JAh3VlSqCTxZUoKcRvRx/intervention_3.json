My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a relationship with a bisexual man. She's struggling with internalized biphobia, which she's realizing when she finds out her boyfriend has had relationships with men. Her main issue seems to be discomfort with his bisexuality and past partners, leading to feelings of disgust and emotional distress. She tries to discuss her feelings with him, but he reacts negatively, calling her a homophobic bitch and suggesting she deal with it alone.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and emotional responsibility. The author is addressing her own feelings, which she recognizes as problematic (internalized homophobia), and is seeking to work through them. She's not attacking her boyfriend's sexuality but is dealing with her own biases. Her boyfriend's response is hostile and dismissive, which is a significant issue. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for bringing up her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is usually encouraged. If someone is experiencing emotions that affect the relationship, discussing them is typically the right approach. The author isn't hiding her feelings; she's trying to address them. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning here, as he's not supporting her and is instead blaming her. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her feelings. She's taking responsibility for her emotions and wants to resolve them, either together or through counseling. The boyfriend's reaction is more at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
