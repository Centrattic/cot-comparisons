My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a 23-year-old bisexual man. They were friends first, and he had mentioned being bisexual but implied he hadn't gone beyond making out. Later, she finds out he's had over 70 partners, including men. She feels disgust and discomfort, which she attributes to internalized homophobia. She tries to talk about it, but he reacts negatively, calling her a homophobic bitch and refusing to work on it together.\n\nThe key points here are about internalized homophobia and communication. The author is trying to address her feelings openly, which is generally a positive step in a relationship. She's seeking to understand and work through her biases, which she recognizes as harmful. However, her partner's reaction is hostile and dismissive. He's not engaging in the conversation constructively and is instead attacking her, which is problematic.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The author's intention to discuss her feelings is not inherently wrong. In fact, addressing internalized biases is important. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning because he's not supporting her efforts and is instead lashing out. The fact that she's trying to seek help (like couples counseling) shows she wants to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of trust and past actions. The boyfriend had not fully disclosed the extent of his past relationships earlier, which might have contributed to her insecurity. But the main issue here is the author's attempt to communicate her feelings. She's not being homophobic; she's trying to confront it. The boyfriend's refusal to engage in the conversation and his hostile response are more indicative of someone in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
