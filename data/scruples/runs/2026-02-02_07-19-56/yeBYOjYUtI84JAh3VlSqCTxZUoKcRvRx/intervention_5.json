My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and their boyfriend is 23. They've been friends before and are now in a relationship. The boyfriend is bisexual and has had multiple partners, including men. The author feels insecure because he was her first and only, and she's now struggling with feelings of disgust when she thinks about him being with men. She tried to talk about it, but he reacted negatively, calling her a homophobic bitch. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are: internalized biphobia, the author's inconsiderate reaction, and the boyfriend's response. The author is trying to address her feelings, which is a positive step. But internalized homophobia is about having negative feelings towards one's own sexuality or others'. However, in this case, the boyfriend is bisexual and the author is struggling with his bisexuality, which is different. It's more like internalized biphobia from her side, not his. She's projecting her own discomfort onto him, which can be harmful.\n\nBut the main question is whether she's in the wrong for discussing these feelings. Open communication in relationships is crucial. She tried to talk about her feelings, which is the right thing to do. However, the way she's handling it might be problematic. Feeling disgusted by her partner's past with men is a form of biphobia, as bisexuality is valid and doesn't diminish his feelings for her. Her reaction, even if well-intentioned, might be hurtful. But the fact that she's trying to address it shows she's aware and wants to improve.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also concerning. Yelling and calling her names is not healthy, and he's dismissing her efforts to work through the problem together. He should be supportive instead of attacking her. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. She's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but she might need to reflect on her own biases. The boyfriend's response is worse because it's unhelpful and hostile.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to discuss her internalized biphobia. It's important to address such issues in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
