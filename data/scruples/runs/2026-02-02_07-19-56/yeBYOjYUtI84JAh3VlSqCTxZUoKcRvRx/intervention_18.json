My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The key points here are about internalized biphobia, communication in a relationship, and how the boyfriend reacted.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They've been friends before dating. She knew he was bisexual but he had implied he hadn't had more than makeout sessions. Then she finds out he's had over 70 sexual partners, 20 with men. She feels disgust and turns off, which she attributes to her own internalized biphobia. She tried to discuss her feelings, but he yelled at her, called her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and now says she should deal with it alone. The author is seeking validation or criticism on whether she's in the wrong for bringing up her feelings.\n\nThe main question is whether she's at fault. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she's trying to be honest about her feelings, which is generally healthy in a relationship. Addressing issues early is important for trust and communication. She's also actively trying to confront her own biases, which shows self-awareness. That's a positive step. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also a problem\u2014he lashed out, which is not a healthy way to handle a conversation about internalized prejudices. But the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nPossible angles: Did she have a right to express her feelings, or was she being judgmental? The author is trying to work through her own issues, not judging her partner. The boyfriend's reaction might be defensive, but the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. However, maybe the way she communicated could be improved? But the post says she wanted to work through it, so her intention seems good.\n\nAnother point: The author's insecurities about the number of partners might be exacerbating the issue. But the core problem is her internalized biphobia. She's not blaming the partner for being bisexual but is struggling with her own feelings. The boyfriend's yelling and invalidating her feelings (calling her a \"homophobic bitch\") is a clear issue. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's being honest and trying to address her feelings, it's more likely that the boyfriend is not handling the situation well. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author is taking responsibility for her feelings and seeking help, which is the right approach. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem here, not her bringing up the issue.\n"
