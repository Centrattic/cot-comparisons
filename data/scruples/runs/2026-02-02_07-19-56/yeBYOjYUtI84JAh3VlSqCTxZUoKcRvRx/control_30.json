My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, a 18-year-old female, and her 23-year-old boyfriend. The main issue is her reaction to finding out he's had sexual experiences with men, which is causing her internalized biphobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her reaction is justified. She's trying to address her feelings, which is a mature approach. She's not rejecting him for being bisexual but rather struggling with her own biases. It's important to note that having internalized prejudice doesn't make someone inherently bad; it's something they can work on. \n\nHer boyfriend's reaction is aggressive, calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" and refusing to engage. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve communication and support, not shaming. By yelling and dismissing her attempts to work through the issue, he's not being constructive. \n\nThe author wants to discuss the problem and even suggests counseling, which shows she's committed to the relationship and her growth. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is pushing her to handle it alone, which might not be fair. \n\nIs the author at fault? She's in a vulnerable position, trying to confront her own biases. Her intentions are good. The boyfriend's response is the bigger issue here. So, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
