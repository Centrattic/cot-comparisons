My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing her internalized biphobia with her boyfriend after he reveals his bisexuality and past relationships with men. \n\nFirst, the author is 18, her boyfriend is 23. They've been dating and were friends before. She knew he was bisexual but thought he hadn't been intimate with men. He later tells her it's more than just make-out sessions. She feels disgusted when thinking about him with men, which conflicts with her identity as an LGBTQ+ ally. She tries to talk about her feelings, but he reacts negatively, calling her homophobic and refusing to work on it together.\n\nThe key points here are her intention to address her feelings rather than hide them. She's trying to be honest and seek help, which is generally healthy in a relationship. However, her boyfriend reacts with anger instead of support. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nShe's in a vulnerable position, dealing with insecurity because she's his first, and she's confronting her own biases. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and not wanting to work through it together is problematic. He dismisses her feelings and blames her for bringing it up. In a healthy relationship, communication and support are key, especially when discussing personal issues that affect the relationship. The author's actions seem justified as she's trying to address her feelings rather than hurt him. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively is more concerning. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her emotions and seeking resolution. The boyfriend's response is what's problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
