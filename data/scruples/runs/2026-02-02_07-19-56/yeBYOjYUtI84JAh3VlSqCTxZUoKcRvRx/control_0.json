My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a girl who's dating a bisexual guy. She's struggling with internalized biphobia after finding out he's had relationships with men. She tried to talk about her feelings, but her boyfriend reacted angrily, calling her homophobic. Now she's feeling stuck.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is honest about her feelings and tried to communicate them. She's not denying his identity but is dealing with her own biases. It's important that she's self-aware and wants to address this. On the other hand, her boyfriend's reaction was harsh. Yelling and calling her names isn't helpful. He might be hurt, but his response is not constructive. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author made an effort to discuss her feelings, which is a mature approach. The boyfriend's refusal to work through it together (suggesting she deal with it alone) might indicate he's not open to resolving the issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she's taking responsibility and trying to fix the problem. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here.\n"
