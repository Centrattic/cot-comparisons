My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old woman, is dating a 23-year-old man who is bisexual. She tried to discuss her internalized biphobia with him, but he reacted negatively, calling her homophobic and saying she was mean for bringing it up. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is dealing with internalized homophobia, which is a real issue even for allies. She's trying to communicate her feelings, which is a responsible approach. However, her boyfriend reacted with anger instead of empathy. The user is asking if she's at fault.\n\nInternalized homophobia can affect anyone, even well-intentioned people. The fact that she's an LGBTQ+ ally and uses her platform to support the community suggests she's not intentionally homophobic. Her actions here are about addressing her own feelings, not attacking his sexuality. She's honest about her struggle and wants to work through it, which is a mature step. Relationships require communication and support, and she's trying to be open.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. He dismissed her feelings and called her names, which isn't helpful. The situation is more about his response than her initial decision to communicate. The author isn't in the wrong for bringing up her feelings, especially since she's seeking to address them constructively. The boyfriend's unwillingness to engage in counseling or work through this with her adds to the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's taking a responsible step to address her internal biases, and the conflict arises more from his reaction than her actions.\n"
