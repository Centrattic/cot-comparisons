My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is about whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is 18, their boyfriend is 23. They were friends before dating. The boyfriend is bisexual and has been with multiple men. The author, who considers themselves an LGBTQ+ ally, feels disgusted when learning about their partner's past and is now uncomfortable in their relationship. They tried to talk to their boyfriend, but he reacted negatively, calling her a homophobic bitch and saying she should have kept it to herself.\n\nThe author is struggling with their own internalized biphobia, which is causing them to feel turned off by their boyfriend's past relationships with men. They tried to communicate their feelings to work through it, but the boyfriend didn't respond well. The key points here are the author's attempt to address an internal issue and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to discuss their feelings to improve the relationship. Even though they have internal biases, they're trying to confront them. It's important to remember that discussing personal insecurities and internalized prejudices is part of self-awareness and growth. However, the way the discussion went down might affect the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and calling someone a \"homophobic bitch\" is not a healthy response to someone trying to open up. He could have been more understanding and supportive, maybe suggesting counseling together. His dismissal of her feelings and stating she should have kept it to herself is problematic because communication is crucial in relationships.\n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they're dealing with their own issues. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning because he's not supporting his partner through their personal growth. So, while the author might have some internal work to do, the main issue is the boyfriend's handling of the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate their feelings; the responsibility for the conflict lies more with the boyfriend's response.\n"
