My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a 23-year-old boyfriend who is bisexual. They were friends first. The boyfriend mentioned he's been with multiple men, which the author finds hard to handle. She's feeling disgusted and turned off, leading her to discuss her internalized biphobia with him. However, when she tried to talk about her feelings, he yelled at her, called her a \"homophobic bitch,\" and said she should have kept it to herself. Now the relationship is strained because he's not willing to engage further, and she's seeking advice on whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author is struggling with her own internalized biphobia. She's trying to confront these feelings by discussing them with her partner, which is a healthy step. She's aware that her feelings are irrational given her own advocacy for LGBTQ+ issues, so she's taking responsibility by wanting to address it. Her intention is to work through the issue, either together or through counseling. However, her boyfriend reacted negatively, attacking her instead of supporting her. He's unwilling to engage, which is a red flag in communication.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether she's in the wrong. The act of trying to discuss her feelings is not wrong. It's important in relationships to communicate issues that affect them. Her intention was to resolve the problem, not to hurt him. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. Yelling and calling her derogatory names is a form of emotional abuse. He should have listened, validated her feelings, and discussed how to address her biphobia. His refusal to engage in the solution, instead blaming her for bringing it up, shows a lack of empathy and emotional maturity.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her feelings. The boyfriend's response is the issue here. He's dismissing her feelings and not taking responsibility for his part in the conflict. The situation highlights a communication breakdown, but the fault isn't on the author for initiating the conversation. She's taking a proactive step to address her biases, which is commendable. The boyfriend's unwillingness to support her in this process is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a good-faith effort to confront her internalized biphobia and improve the relationship. The boyfriend's hostile reaction is the main issue here. He should be supportive and work through this with her, not shut her down. The author's actions are justified as she's trying to be honest about her feelings and seek a solution.\n"
