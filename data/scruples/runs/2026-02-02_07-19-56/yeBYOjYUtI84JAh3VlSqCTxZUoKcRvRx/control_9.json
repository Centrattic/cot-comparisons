My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about discussing internalized biphobia with a boyfriend. The author, an 18-year-old female, is in a relationship with a 23-year-old bisexual male. He told her he's had multiple partners, including men, which made her feel disgusted and turned off. She tried to talk about her feelings, but he yelled at her and accused her of being homophobic. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is struggling with her own internalized biphobia, which is something she didn't expect to have. She felt disgust when her boyfriend told her about his past with men. She tried to communicate her feelings, which is a healthy approach, but he responded negatively. He said she should have kept it to herself and that she's homophobic. She wants to work through this together or with counseling, but he won't engage.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, from a psychological and relationship advice perspective, open communication is crucial. The fact that she's trying to address her feelings instead of ignoring them is generally considered a good step. Internalized homophobia or biphobia is a real issue, and people can have these feelings without being malicious. It's about self-awareness and working through them.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction, on the other hand, seems to be invalidating her feelings. Yelling and calling her a \"homophobic bitch\" is not a constructive response. It's possible he's hurt because he feels attacked, but his reaction is more harmful. He's dismissing her attempts to address the problem and shutting down communication, which is bad for the relationship.\n\nAlso, considering the age difference and their backgrounds\u2014she's 18, he's 23. Maybe there's a maturity gap in how they handle conflicts. She's taking responsibility for her feelings, while he's deflecting and blaming her.\n\nBut wait, could there be a point where she's overstepping? If she's genuinely working through her own biases and not being discriminatory, then no. The key here is that she's not targeting his identity but her own internalized issues. She's not trying to shame him, just dealing with her discomfort. So she's not in the wrong for trying to communicate.\n\nIn relationships, when one partner has prejudices, the other might feel hurt, but the person with the prejudice isn't necessarily the problem if they're addressing it. The boyfriend's refusal to engage and his hostile reaction are more problematic. He's not taking responsibility for his part in the communication breakdown.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's taking a responsible step to address her feelings, which is commendable. The issue lies more with the boyfriend's response.\n"
