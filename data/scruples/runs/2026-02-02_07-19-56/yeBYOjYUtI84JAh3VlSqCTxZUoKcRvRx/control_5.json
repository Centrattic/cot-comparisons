My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for discussing their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a 18-year-old female in a relationship with a 23-year-old bisexual boyfriend. She knew he was bisexual but found out he had been with many men. She's struggling with her feelings, feels disgusted, and is having trouble being intimate. She tried to talk to him about her internalized homophobia and how she's dealing with his past relationships, but he reacted negatively, yelling at her and saying she's a homophobic bitch. Now the relationship is strained because he doesn't want to address the issue.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual effort in a relationship. The author is trying to address her feelings and wants to work through them, either together or through counseling. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is rejecting her attempts, which is causing more harm. \n\nInternalized homophobia is a real issue, and it's important for someone to confront it, especially when it affects their relationship. The author's intention to discuss it shows self-awareness and a desire to improve the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is hostile and dismissive, which isn't a healthy way to handle such a sensitive topic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should be supportive and willing to work through challenges together. The author isn't at fault for trying to communicate her feelings. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively is a bigger issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her feelings and wants to address them, which is the right approach. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem here.\n"
