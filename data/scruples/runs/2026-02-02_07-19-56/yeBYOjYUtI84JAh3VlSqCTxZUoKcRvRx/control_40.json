My(18f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been dating for a little while, and we were friends for some time before that. Now I had known that he was bisexual from previous discussions but he had heavily implied he had never gone further than a good makeout sesh.\n\nFast forward to last week when he lets me know that it\u2019s gone much, MUCH further than that with multiple men on multiple occasions. Now i\u2019m already quite insecure about the number of sexual partners he\u2019s had because he was my first and only everything, including my first kiss, and i\u2019m now aware that he\u2019s had well over 70+ different partners (about 20 being men) so that\u2019s already a bit hard to swallow as stupid as it may seem.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big issue. I\u2019ve always considered myself a huge ally for the lgbtq community. I have a fairly well known online presence so I use it to push for change and encourage others to do the same with protests and such. I never ever thought I would have an issue with my partner being bisexual. But when he told me I was suddenly filled with disgust. I am now genuinely turned off when he tries to initiate cause I just think about him with men. It\u2019s also quite odd to me because he informed me that he is a bottom where as he is very dominant in our relationship and it\u2019s just plain weird to me. I\u2019ve cried about it all week because I can\u2019t believe that as hard as I try, homophobia has creeped into my brain.\n\nI tried to discuss how I was feeling with him because I knew bottling up these feelings wouldn\u2019t end well for either of us and I really do love him. He ended up yelling at me that I was a homophobic bitch and that he wished I had never said anything. But I don\u2019t WANT to keep it to myself. I love him and I want to work through this either together or through couples counseling. But he says it\u2019s something I need to deal with on my own. It\u2019s killing our relationship because he now says I should\u2019ve just never told him and it was mean of me to do so.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to discuss their internalized biphobia with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a 23-year-old man who is bisexual. She knew he was bi but hadn't realized he had been physically intimate with men. When she found out, she felt disgusted and turned off, leading to emotional distress. She tried to talk about her feelings, but her boyfriend reacted angrily, called her names, and said she should have kept it to herself. Now she's feeling like an asshole for bringing it up, even though she's trying to work through her internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she's trying to address her own feelings of discomfort, which she recognizes as internalized homophobia. She's seeking to communicate and resolve this issue because she loves him. However, her boyfriend is not receptive, even hostile. The question is whether she's wrong to bring up this discussion.\n\nInternalized homophobia is a real issue, especially for allies who might not realize their biases until they're confronted with them personally. The author is taking a responsible step by acknowledging her feelings and trying to address them, which is a healthy approach in a relationship. Trying to communicate openly about such a sensitive topic is generally considered the right thing to do, as suppressing emotions can lead to bigger problems.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. Yelling and calling her names isn't a constructive way to handle the situation. He's dismissing her feelings and not engaging in a way that could lead to resolution. His response is more about deflection and anger than understanding or support. \n\nThe author isn't the one at fault here. She's making an effort to be self-aware and work on her issues, which shows maturity. The boyfriend's issue is his reaction, not her bringing up the topic. Even though the discussion might be uncomfortable, initiating it is necessary for a healthy relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's trying to address a personal issue that affects the relationship, and it's important to communicate such feelings. The problem lies more with the boyfriend's handling of the situation.\n"
