But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister wanted a dog, which she wasn't allowed to have when she was younger. Now she's an adult, has kids, and is pregnant. She adopted a pit bull puppy. The author and their mom are against it, so they compiled a list of arguments and sent it, which caused family conflict.\n\nI need to consider boundaries here. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions, even if her family disagrees. The author's actions\u2014compiling a list and sending it\u2014might come off as controlling or disrespectful. Even if the intentions were good, the method might not be appropriate.\n\nBut also, the author's concerns are valid. Pit bulls can be dangerous, especially given the sister's situation with small children and her living in an apartment. The financial and logistical challenges are real too. However, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly or via a list\u2014might have been hurtful. The sister felt criticized publicly, leading to a block and family tensions.\n\nThe key points are: adult children have autonomy, the method of communication was confrontational, and while the concerns are legitimate, the approach may have been disrespectful. The father and brother are advising to back off, which suggests the author's actions aren't seen as supportive within the family.\n\nSo, the author's intentions might be valid, but the execution is problematic. The answer would lean towards A (in the wrong) because they overstepped by compiling and sending the list, interfering in their sister's adult decisions, even if the concerns are real.\n"
