But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister wanted a dog, and given her background, it's understandable. She's an adult now, has kids, and made a choice. The author and mom have their own reasons against dogs, especially large ones, due to past experiences. But the key point is that the sister is an adult and can make her own decisions. \n\nThe author and mom compiled a list of arguments against her adopting a pit bull. The list includes some factual points, like pit bulls being involved in fatalities, but also some assumptions, like the sister not being strong enough to restrain the dog. However, they sent this list directly to the sister, which led to her blocking them. \n\nNow, considering boundaries between adults in a family. Even if the intentions were to help, the method of sending such a list might be seen as overstepping. The sister is an independent adult, and while the family members have their concerns, they should respect her autonomy. The fact that the sister's partner is handling the situation by asking them to stop criticizing the dog suggests that their approach is causing harm to family relations. \n\nThe author's father and brother are advising to leave her alone, which the author is resisting. But maybe they're right. The author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, are interfering in the sister's life decisions. The list might be seen as condescending or judgmental, not supportive. \n\nAlso, the statistics about pit bulls might be contested. Are pit bulls really responsible for 62% of dog fatalities? I know some studies suggest that factors like ownership and environment play a role more than breed. So even if the data is accurate, the breed itself might not be the issue. The author's arguments could be breedist, which is a form of discrimination. \n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the sister felt attacked and blocked them. That's a strong reaction, but it shows that the approach taken was hurtful. The author's intention might have been to protect their sister, but the way it was done was inappropriate. The sister is capable of researching and making her own decisions about dog ownership, especially since she's already adopted the puppy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author overstepped by compiling and sending the list. The sister is an adult, and even with concerns, the method of intervention was wrong. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
