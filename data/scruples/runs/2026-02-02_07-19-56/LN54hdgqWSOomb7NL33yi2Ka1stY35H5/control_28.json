But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe sister wanted a dog for a long time. The author and their mom aren't fans of dogs because of past experiences. The sister, now grown with two kids, decides to adopt a pit bull. The family had a big argument about it, and then the author and mom made a list of arguments against it, sent it to the sister, who then blocked them. The author is worried they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the family dynamics and the reasons given. The sister is an adult, so her right to make her own decisions is important. The author's mom and author are trying to influence her decision, which might be seen as overstepping. But they also list concerns that are valid, like the dog's potential danger, cost, and lifestyle issues. However, the way they presented these concerns\u2014by compiling a list and sending it without her asking\u2014might come off as intrusive. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction (blocking them) suggests that the method of communication was hurtful. The author's intention was to protect, but maybe they didn't consider the sister's autonomy. Even if their concerns are valid, the approach might not be appropriate. The father and brother think they should leave it alone, which adds another layer. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong entirely because they have valid concerns, but the way they handled it could be the issue. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. In many cases, when adults make their own decisions and family members push their opinions without being asked, it can be seen as crossing a line. The author's actions caused a family rift, which is significant. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister wasn't forced to adopt the dog, but the family's criticism after the fact is problematic. The list could be seen as unsolicited advice, especially given the emotional context. The sister's blocking them indicates that the message was received as an attack rather than concern. \n\nSo, considering the sister's autonomy and the method of delivery, maybe the author is in the wrong. But it's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the right to make decisions outweighs the concerns, but since the sister made her decision, the author's interference might be the issue here.\n"
