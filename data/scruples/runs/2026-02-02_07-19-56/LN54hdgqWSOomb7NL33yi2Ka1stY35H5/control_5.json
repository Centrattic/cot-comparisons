But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is an adult, has kids, and made her own decision. The writer and their mom are against it, citing various concerns like breed statistics, physical strength, and financial issues. They compiled a list and sent it, leading to a family conflict.\n\nThe main points to consider are: the sister's autonomy, the validity of the arguments presented, and how they were delivered. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own choices, even if family members disagree. The arguments given might have merit, but the way they were presented could be problematic. Sending a list of reasons after the adoption might come off as judgmental or controlling, especially if the sister felt it was an intrusion into her personal decision.\n\nAlso, the family dynamics are tense. The parents and siblings are divided. The mother and the writer took it upon themselves to create a list without considering the sister's perspective. The sister blocking them suggests that the approach was hurtful. Even if their intentions were to protect her, the method of communicating their concerns might have been inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the validity of the concerns. Pit bulls do have some statistics regarding aggression, but individual temperament varies. The sister's situation\u2014having a young child and being pregnant\u2014might mean the dog's behavior could affect the kids. However, the sister has already adopted the dog, so the advice is retrospective. It's possible the writer and mom should have discussed their concerns earlier rather than later, especially after the adoption.\n\nThe family's reaction to the list causing a rift might indicate that the approach was not well-received. The sister feeling criticized by her family could lead to emotional distress. Even if the writer believes they're right, the lack of support during a stressful time (pregnancy, caring for kids) might make their actions seem unsupportive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the writer's intent was to prevent potential issues, but the method was confrontational. Maybe a more supportive approach, like offering help with the dog or discussing the decision before adoption, would have been better. Now that the adoption is done, the list might be perceived as unnecessary criticism rather than helpful advice.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer might not be entirely in the wrong because they were concerned about their sister's well-being. However, the way they handled it could be seen as overstepping, especially since the sister is an adult. The key issue is respecting her autonomy versus expressing valid concerns. Since she's an adult, the writer should probably step back and let her handle it, even if they disagree. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The user wants a yes or no, so based on the reasoning, the writer's actions were misguided but not entirely in the wrong.\n"
