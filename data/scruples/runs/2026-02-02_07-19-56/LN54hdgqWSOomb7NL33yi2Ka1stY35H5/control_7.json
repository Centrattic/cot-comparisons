But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. The situation is a bit complicated. The sister has wanted a puppy for a long time, and the author and their mom aren't fans of dogs due to past experiences. The sister did some back and forth and decided to adopt a pit bull. The family had a big argument, and the author and mom made a list of concerns to send to the sister, which led to her blocking them and considering not attending Christmas dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author supports their sister's right to make her own decisions as an adult but still sent a list of arguments. The list includes statistics about pit bulls and practical concerns like the dog's strength, the sister's ability to handle it, the child's crying triggering the dog, neighbor issues, high maintenance, cost, and the dog's living conditions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The sister is an adult with her own family, so she should have the autonomy to decide on pet ownership. The author's intent was to express concerns, but doing so in a list format after a previous argument might come off as dismissive or controlling. The list includes some factual info (like pit bull stats) but also assumptions (e.g., that her daughter's crying would trigger the dog, which might not be accurate). \n\nAre the author's concerns valid? Pit bulls can be strong and have been involved in some incidents, but that's a generalization. Responsible ownership is key, and the sister might have done her research. The financial and maintenance aspects are practical points, but again, the sister could be prepared for that. However, presenting these as a list after the adoption decision might be seen as undermining her choice, especially if she's already committed. \n\nThe main issue here is the approach. Instead of giving the list after the adoption, maybe they should have discussed it privately and respectfully, without compiling a public list. The sister feels that her choice is being criticized, and the list might have been perceived as a final judgment rather than a concern for her well-being. Also, the fact that she blocked the author and the family is now divided suggests that the method was hurtful. \n\nWhile the author's intentions might be to protect their sister and others from potential harm, the way they communicated it could be seen as overstepping. The sister's autonomy is important, and the author's actions might have been more about imposing their own fears and their mom's opinions rather than respecting her adult decision. The list may have lacked empathy and considered the emotional impact, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nSo, even if the concerns are somewhat valid, the manner in which they were delivered is problematic. The author is not the asshole for having concerns, but sending a list like that after the adoption, especially in a family setting where tensions are high, makes them in the wrong. The answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
