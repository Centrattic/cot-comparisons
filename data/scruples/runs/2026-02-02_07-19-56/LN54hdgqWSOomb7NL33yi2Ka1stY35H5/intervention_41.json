But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their mother creating a list of reasons against their sister's decision to adopt a pit bull and sending it to her, leading to a family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is an adult, making her own life choices. The author and their mother are concerned about the dog's potential dangers, but they decided to compile a list and send it, which resulted in the sister being upset and cutting off communication. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The sister made an autonomous decision as an adult. While the family's concerns might be valid, presenting them in a list that's shared without the sister's permission could be seen as overstepping. The author and their mother didn't just express their opinions in a family discussion; they created a more formal list and sent it, which might have come across as confrontational rather than supportive. \n\nAlso, the sister is in a vulnerable situation with two young children and a pregnancy. The list includes points about her being physically unable to restrain the dog, which could be triggering or judgmental. The fact that the sister blocked them after receiving the list indicates it was hurtful, even if the intentions were to protect her.\n\nThe father and brother advise the author to back off, suggesting that the family's approach might be too harsh. The author's actions, while motivated by concern, might not respect the sister's autonomy. The method of sharing the list without dialogue could have been more collaborative, like discussing their concerns in person rather than sending a prewritten list.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author's actions might not be malicious but they do disregard the sister's independence. The line between helpful advice and overbearing interference is crossed here. The sister's reaction (blocking them) shows the impact of the list was negative. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions, though well-intentioned, were likely a breach of the sister's boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
