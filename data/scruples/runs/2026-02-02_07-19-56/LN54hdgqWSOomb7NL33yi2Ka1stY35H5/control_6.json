But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for sending a list of reasons to their sister against adopting a pit bull. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the sister has wanted a dog for a long time, is an adult, has kids, and decided to get a pit bull. The author and their mom are against it, and they compiled a list of arguments. The sister got upset and blocked them, now there's tension with Christmas dinner.\n\nThe key points here are intent and approach. The author says they support their sister's right to make her own decisions as an adult. The list was created to present facts, but sending it might have been a poor way to communicate. Pit bulls are a controversial breed, and while there are statistics about dog fatalities, it's important to consider if those numbers are accurate or if the breed is being unfairly stigmatized. Some people argue that any dog can be dangerous if not properly trained, and breed isn't the sole factor.\n\nThe arguments listed include things like the dog's strength, the sister's ability to handle it, potential noise issues, costs, and confinement. These are valid concerns, especially for someone new to dog ownership with a young child. However, presenting them in a list after a previous conflict might come off as dismissive or not respecting her autonomy. The sister felt criticized, leading to her blocking them. The author's brother and father are telling them to back off, which suggests family dynamics are at play.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be genuine concern for their sister's well-being and the dog's. But the method of communication\u2014sending a compiled list after a family argument\u2014might have been confrontational. It's possible the sister felt attacked, especially if the list was presented as definitive arguments rather than open discussion. The fact that the sister is pregnant and has a young child adds to the sensitivity around the decision, which the author might be worried about for valid reasons.\n\nHowever, as an adult, the sister has the right to make her own choices. The author might have overstepped by compiling and sending the list, especially after the sister had already made the decision and was not interested in further debate. The blocking indicates that the sister felt the communication was unwelcome and hurtful. The author's intentions are good, but the approach could be seen as controlling or not respecting boundaries, which might make them the asshole here. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they have valid concerns, the way they handled it was not respectful of their sister's autonomy and likely escalated the conflict unnecessarily.\n"
