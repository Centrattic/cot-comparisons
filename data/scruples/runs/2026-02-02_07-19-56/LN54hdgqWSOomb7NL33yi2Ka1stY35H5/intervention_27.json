But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the sister should have a pit bull. The author and their mom made a list of reasons against it and sent it to the sister, which caused a block and family tension.\n\nFirst, the sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions. The author's mom and the author themselves aren't huge fans of dogs, but the sister is an adult with her own family. The author's reasons are about the dog's potential dangers and the sister's circumstances, like her not being strong enough to control the dog, the dog's possible aggression, and financial issues. However, the way they present these points is as a list of arguments, which might come off as judgmental or not considering the sister's perspective.\n\nEven if the concerns are valid, the method of presenting them is through a list that sounds more like criticism than a supportive discussion. The sister might feel attacked, especially since the author and mom went behind her back initially and then sent the list. The sister's reaction of blocking the author is a strong response, which shows she felt hurt or disrespected. The author's intention might have been to prevent problems, but the approach led to more conflict.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction is divided. The father and brother are telling the author to leave the sister alone, which suggests that the author's actions are causing unnecessary conflict. The sister is in her second pregnancy, so maybe the stress from this conflict isn't helpful. The author's insistence on pushing their views despite the sister's decision could be seen as overstepping, as they're not the ones living with the dog or making the daily decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns about safety and the sister's ability to care for a dog are legitimate. Pit bulls can be strong and sometimes have aggression issues, so the author isn't entirely wrong in their concerns. However, the way they addressed it was through a list that sounds more like an attack rather than an open conversation. The sister might have felt that her autonomy was being violated, especially since she's an adult and made her decision despite their disapproval.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the key points are the method of communication and the respect for the sister's autonomy. Even with valid concerns, the approach taken by the author and mother was confrontational and disrespectful. The sister's right to make her own choices, even if it's a decision they disagree with, is important. So, the author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, were likely not the right way to handle the situation. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
