But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their mother compiled a list of reasons against their sister's decision to adopt a pit bull and then sent it to her, leading to some family tension. The sister blocked them after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sister is an adult, has her own family, and made the decision to adopt a dog despite previous family opposition. The author and their mom are concerned about the dog's potential risks, like aggression, the sister's ability to handle it, and financial issues. But they took it a step further by making a list and sending it, which seems to cross into being overbearing.\n\nRespecting autonomy is a big point here. The sister is an adult and capable of making her own choices, even if they're not the ones the author agrees with. The author's actions\u2014compiling a list and sending it after a prior conflict\u2014might be seen as not respecting her decisions. The sister felt criticized enough to block them, which shows the action had a negative impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns aren't entirely unfounded. Pit bulls do have a higher percentage in dog-related incidents, and the sister's financial situation and living conditions are valid points. However, the way the author addressed it by creating a list and forcing it upon her during a family gathering seems inappropriate. They should have perhaps discussed it more privately and respectfully, but compiling a list to confront her with might be seen as an overreach.\n\nThe father and brother's advice to leave her alone suggests that the author's approach might not be the best way to handle family dynamics. The author's intention might be to protect their sister, but the method used was confrontational. The sister's reaction of being upset and considering not attending a family event shows that the author's actions caused harm.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be to help, the execution crossed into being judgmental and possibly disrespectful of the sister's autonomy. The key here is that the sister is an adult making her own choices, and the author's approach was not supportive but critical, leading to a negative outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
