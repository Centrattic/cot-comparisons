But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to his sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister wanted a dog, and as an adult, she decided to adopt a pit bull. The author and their mom aren't fans of dogs, and the author has a history of fear from a past incident. The mom was disappointed when the sister got the dog. Then they made a list of arguments against the adoption, sent it to the sister, and she blocked them. Now the author is worried about being the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The sister is an adult, which means she can make her own decisions. The author and mom think they're acting in her best interest, but they took it upon themselves to compile and send a list of criticisms, leading to a conflict. The sister felt criticized despite being an adult, which led to her blocking them. The father and brother are telling the author to back off.\n\nThe main issue is whether it's appropriate for the author to intervene in his sister's decision. Even if their concerns are valid (like the dog's behavior, financial issues, etc.), the method of addressing it is questionable. Instead of a private, supportive conversation, they sent a list that came across as judgmental. The sister felt her autonomy was disrespected, especially since she's an adult and a parent now. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the approach was confrontational and hurtful, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the concerns might be valid, the way they were communicated was likely the problem. The sister's reaction shows that she felt her decisions were being undermined. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the sister is an adult and capable of making her own choices. The author's justification of protecting her long-term well-being doesn't excuse the method used. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for the approach, even if the intentions were good.\n"
