But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step. \n\nThe author's sister wanted a dog for a long time, but when she was younger, their mom and the author didn't want a dog. Now the sister is an adult with two kids and decided to adopt a pit bull. The author and their mom were worried, so they made a list of reasons against the adoption and sent it to the sister, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's autonomy. She's an adult, so she should have the right to make her own decisions, right? The author and mom's list includes arguments about the dog's danger, the sister's ability to handle it, and other practical issues. But is it their place to intervene? \n\nThe author and mom might have good intentions, worrying about the sister's safety and the dog's well-being. Pit bulls are often stigmatized, but they can be good pets if properly trained. The list's statistics might not be accurate or could be biased. For example, the claim that pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities is something I've heard before, but I'm not sure if it's factual. If that's a common myth, pointing it out without evidence could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the sister is in a new situation with her own family. She might have done her research and made an informed decision. The author's family is overstepping by compiling and sending a list of arguments, especially in a conflictual way. Blocking each other is harsh, but the sister's reaction might be due to feeling judged by her family. \n\nThe author is trying to protect the sister from potential problems, but the method of communication and the content of the list might have been aggressive. The sister is being called an irresponsible parent, which is a hurtful accusation. The author's mom and brother are advising to let it go, which suggests that the family dynamics are causing more harm than good. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns might be valid, the way they expressed them was intrusive. The sister's autonomy as an adult should be respected. The author might be well-meaning but is in the wrong for interfering in a personal decision without supporting the sister's choice, even if they disagree.\n"
