But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their sister adopting a pit bull, and the author and their mom sent a list of arguments against it, leading to a family conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their sister is an adult and can make her own decisions. But they still felt the need to compile a list of reasons against the adoption. The key points here are about autonomy and whether family members have the right to interfere in such decisions. The sister is in a different stage of life, starting a family, and her choice to get a dog might be personal. \n\nThe arguments provided in the list include statistics about pit bulls and potential risks like aggression, financial burden, and living conditions. However, some of these points might be based on stereotypes. For example, the claim that pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities is a statistic that can be controversial and might not account for other factors like breed-specific legislation or individual dog behavior. Also, saying she's not strong enough to restrain the dog could be an assumption without knowing her physical capabilities.\n\nThe author's actions led to the sister blocking them, which shows that the approach was hurtful. Even though the author's intentions were to protect the sister, the method of communication was confrontational. Instead of a private, respectful conversation, they sent a list that came off as critical and judgmental. The sister's reaction indicates she felt attacked, which might have been avoidable with a more supportive approach.\n\nFamily dynamics play a role here too. The author and their mom might be projecting their own negative experiences with dogs onto the sister. However, the sister has her own reasons and has thought about the adoption, so the family's concerns, while valid, might not outweigh her autonomy. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on family relationships. The conflict escalated, affecting holidays and causing emotional distress. The author's brother and father want to let the sister have her dog, showing that there's a divide in how family members view the situation. The author's insistence on pushing their views might harm family bonds more than the dog itself.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author believes they're acting in the sister's best interest, but the sister sees it as interference. The ethical question is whether the author has the right to make such decisions for someone else, even if they're family. The sister is an adult, so unless there's direct harm to others (like children), her choice should be respected.\n\nThe sister's partner also mediates, which suggests she's not acting impulsively and has support. The author's list might have been well-intentioned but poorly executed. They could have offered help or resources instead of criticism, which might have been more constructive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns might have some merit, their approach was disrespectful and overstepped. The sister's autonomy and the resulting family conflict suggest that the author is in the wrong for not respecting her decision and handling it in a confrontational manner.\n"
