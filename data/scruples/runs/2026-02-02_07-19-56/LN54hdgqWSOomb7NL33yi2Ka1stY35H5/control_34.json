But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and their mother sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister, who has just adopted one. The sister got upset and blocked them. The author is worried they might be the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is an adult, has kids, and made her own decision. The author and mother are concerned about the dog's potential dangers, like aggression, costs, and living conditions. But they compiled a list and sent it to her without her asking. That might be overstepping.\n\nThe sister's reaction was blocking them, which is a strong response, but maybe she felt attacked. The author's intentions were to prevent harm, but using a list of arguments in a family gathering context might have been confrontational. Family dynamics matter here. Even if the concerns are valid, the way they were presented could have been hurtful.\n\nThe author's mother and brother are now telling them to back off, which suggests there's a rift in the family. The father and brother side with the sister, thinking the author is overstepping. The author might be right to be concerned about the dog's impact, but the method of addressing it\u2014sending a pre-written list without dialogue\u2014could be seen as dismissive of the sister's autonomy.\n\nPit bulls do have some breed-specific risks, but the statistics cited (like 62% of fatalities) are often debated and can be misleading without context. Using such stats might contribute to breed discrimination, which is a sensitive topic. Also, the sister's situation (apartment living, limited income) is different from the authors', so their advice might not be well-informed about her specific circumstances.\n\nIn terms of the sister's response, blocking is an extreme reaction, but she might feel that her autonomy as an adult is being violated. The authors, by not giving her a chance to explain or discuss, might have acted in a way that's not supportive. The key here is respecting her decisions as an adult, even if they disagree.\n\nSo, balancing the intention to help against the sister's right to make her own choices, the authors might have crossed a line. They should have approached the situation with more empathy and dialogue rather than a list of arguments. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
