But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The author, along with their mother, made a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull and sent it to their sister. The sister adopted the dog despite their objections, and this led to family conflict. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, the author and mother compiled the list without the sister's consent. Even though they might have good intentions, sharing such a list without the sister's agreement could be seen as overstepping. The sister is an adult, and the author acknowledges that she can make her own decisions. By sending the list, they're interfering in her personal choice, which she already made. This might be considered disrespectful, especially since the sister had already adopted the dog.\n\nNext, the list includes some factual points about pit bulls, like statistics on fatalities and their strength. However, some points might be based on stereotypes. For example, the claim that pit bulls are more dangerous due to strength might not be entirely accurate, as aggression can depend on many factors including upbringing and socialization. The author's list could be perpetuating misinformation about the breed, which might not be fair.\n\nAnother point is the sister's situation as a parent. The author's list mentions her daughter's crying setting off the dog, but this is speculative. The sister's ability to care for the dog isn't being assessed based on her actual situation, but rather on assumptions. The author's mother and they themselves are projecting potential problems without knowing the sister's preparedness.\n\nThe family conflict escalated, leading to the sister blocking them and considering not attending Christmas dinner. The author's actions contributed to this tension. Even though the author might believe they're helping, the way they handled it\u2014without the sister's input\u2014could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe father and brother advise the author to leave the sister alone, suggesting that the author's approach isn't the best way to handle the situation. The author's insistence on their stance, despite family advice, might indicate a lack of respect for the sister's autonomy and the family's desire to avoid conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns might be valid, the method of expressing them\u2014without consent and in a confrontational way\u2014likely made them the asshole. The key issues are overstepping boundaries, using a list to pressure an adult sister, and contributing to family discord instead of supporting her decision as an independent adult.\n"
