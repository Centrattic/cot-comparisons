But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister wanted a dog, went to a shelter, and adopted a pit bull. The author, along with their mom, made a list of arguments against the adoption and sent it to the sister, leading to a fallout. Now, the author is worried they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are family dynamics, personal choices, and boundaries. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions. The author's mom and the author themselves weren't in favor of the dog, possibly due to their past experiences. But the sister is an adult with a family of her own. \n\nWhen the author and mom compiled the list and sent it, was that overstepping? The sister felt criticized and blocked them. The father and brother are telling the author to leave it alone, which might indicate that the author is pushing boundaries here. \n\nThe list itself includes factual points about pit bulls, like statistics on fatalities, the dog's strength, and potential issues with housing. But even if those facts are accurate, the way they're presented could be seen as intrusive. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being violated, especially since she's an adult making her own choices. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent harm, but the method of sending a list after the adoption might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author and mom should have discussed their concerns privately with the sister before the adoption, rather than after. Sending the list publicly or through messages might have been hurtful and not helpful. \n\nAlso, the sister's response of blocking them and the family conflict suggests that the communication wasn't effective. The author might be overstepping by not respecting the sister's decision, even if they disagree. Family members have a right to their opinions, but they also need to respect each other's choices once those decisions are made. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intentions were to protect their sister. The sister's autonomy as an adult is important, and the way the author handled the situation could be viewed as disrespectful. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. But wait, are there any valid points in the list? The arguments about the dog's potential dangers and costs are legitimate, but the manner in which they were delivered is problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had concerns, the way they addressed them was inappropriate, leading to conflict. The sister's right to make her own choices should be respected, so the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
