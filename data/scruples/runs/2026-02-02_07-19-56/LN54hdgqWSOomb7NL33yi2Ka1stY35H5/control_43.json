But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister wanted a dog and adopted a pit bull despite the family's concerns. The author and mom compiled a list of arguments against the adoption and sent it to the sister. The sister was upset and blocked them. Now the author is worried they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points to consider. The sister is an adult, responsible for her own decisions. The author's reasons are based on safety (pit bulls' strength, aggression stats), practical concerns (costs, living situation), and the sister's ability to handle the dog. But does the author have the right to interfere?\n\nFamily dynamics matter here. The author and mom were involved in past decisions (like not getting a dog when the sister was a kid), but now she's an adult. The sister's current situation includes being a parent, which adds complexity. The author's arguments might be valid, but how they delivered them could be the issue. Sending a compiled list after a family conflict might come off as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the sister felt criticized, leading to blocking and avoiding family events. The author's intention was to help, but the sister perceived it as a personal attack. The father and brother siding against the author suggests a family rift. The author's concern about the dog's impact is genuine, but the approach might have been unhelpful.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the sister made her own decision as an adult. While the author's list might have good points, the method of presenting them could be seen as overstepping. The sister's reaction shows the message was hurtful, even if the content was well-meaning. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the way they handled it could be the problem. However, since the sister is an adult, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing concerns, but maybe they should have approached it differently.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the concerns are valid, but the approach could be flawed. However, the line between concern and overstepping is thin. Given the family context and the sister's autonomy, the author's actions might not make them the asshole, but they need to reflect on their approach.\n"
