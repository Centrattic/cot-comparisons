But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and their mother sending a list of reasons against their sister adopting a pit bull. The sister had always wanted a dog as a kid but wasn't allowed because of the author and their mom. Now she's an adult with two kids and she adopted a pit bull. The author and mom, along with the brother and dad, are split on this.\n\nFirst, the author supports their mother's stance. They compiled a list of arguments against the adoption, citing things like pit bulls being responsible for a high percentage of fatalities, strength issues, potential for aggression due to the daughter crying, and other practical concerns like vet costs and housing discrimination. Then they sent the list to the sister, leading to her blocking them and a family conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The sister is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The author and mother are essentially overstepping by compiling and sending this list. Even if their concerns are valid, the method of addressing them might be inappropriate. The sister is responsible for her own choices, and while they can express their opinions, actively sending a list to criticize her decision could be seen as controlling or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, considering the context, the sister is dealing with being a new parent and another pregnancy. The author's arguments might be well-intentioned, but the way they're presented could be hurtful. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being undermined. The fact that she blocked them and is considering not attending Christmas dinner shows the impact of their actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns are genuine. Pit bulls do have a higher risk of aggression compared to some breeds, and the financial and practical aspects are valid. However, it's important to respect the sister's autonomy. As adults, family members should communicate their concerns without imposing their will. The author might have expressed their worries in a way that's more confrontational than supportive.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's right to make her own decisions, the method of conveying concerns, and the resulting harm to family relationships. Even if the concerns are valid, the approach taken by the author and mother was likely wrong. They should have discussed their worries privately with the sister without compiling a list of arguments, which comes off as unsolicited and judgmental. The sister's reaction\u2014blocking them\u2014shows that the approach was hurtful and ineffective.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they crossed a line by interfering in their sister's adult decisions with a confrontational list, despite valid concerns. The method was inappropriate, and they should have respected her autonomy instead of trying to influence her through criticism.\n"
