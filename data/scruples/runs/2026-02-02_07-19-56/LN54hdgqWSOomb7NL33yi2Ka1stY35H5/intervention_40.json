But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their mother sending a compiled list of reasons against adopting a pit bull to their sister, which led to a family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister, an adult woman with a young child and another pregnancy, decided to adopt a pit bull despite her family's objections. The author and their mother had their own reasons for not liking dogs, based on past experiences. They felt it was their responsibility to voice their concerns, especially after a family argument where the mother was disappointed. They created a list of arguments and sent it to the sister, who then blocked them and the family is now divided.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The sister is an adult and has the right to make her own choices, even if her family disagrees. The author and their mother might have good intentions, thinking they're protecting the sister from potential dangers, but their approach was to compile and send a list of arguments, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the concerns are valid, how they're presented matters. The sister might feel that the list is an attack on her decision-making, especially after a previous argument where the mother called her an irresponsible parent. The author's actions could have been more supportive, offering help or resources instead of lecturing. Also, the sister's partner is mentioned as compassionate, which might indicate he supports her choice, but the family's interference is causing stress and affecting family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author believes their concerns are valid\u2014pit bulls can be dangerous, the sister's financial situation, her living conditions, etc. However, the method of addressing these concerns by sending a list after the adoption might not be the best approach. It's possible the author and mother felt compelled to act because they were worried, but their actions contributed to family conflict rather than resolving it. The sister was already upset, leading to blocking, which shows the approach was not effective.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. While the concerns might have merit, the way they were handled (compiling a list and sending it after the fact) is likely what caused the problem. Supporting a family member's choice, even when disagreeing, is important, especially when the person is an adult. The author's approach seems to lack empathy and respect for the sister's autonomy, which are key factors here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they interfered in a personal decision with a confrontational approach, even if their intentions were noble. They should have focused on supporting their sister while expressing their concerns more constructively.\n"
