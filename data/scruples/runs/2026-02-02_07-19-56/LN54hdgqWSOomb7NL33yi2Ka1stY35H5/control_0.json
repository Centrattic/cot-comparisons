But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister wanted a dog, went to a shelter, and chose a pit bull. The author and their mom are not fans of dogs due to past experiences. They had a conflict with the sister, and then created a list of arguments against the adoption. They sent the list, which caused the sister to block them and potentially avoid family gatherings.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're trying to protect their sister from potential dangers and problems with a pit bull. They mention various points like the dog's strength, the sister's physical ability to handle it, the kids, neighbors, costs, etc. On the other hand, the sister feels her autonomy is being questioned, especially since she's an adult and a parent now.\n\nNow, considering the key factors: the sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions. The author's intention was to warn her, but the method\u2014compiling and sending a list\u2014might be seen as overstepping. Family dynamics matter here. The sister's choice could be personal, and the author's actions might have been perceived as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy. Even if the concerns are valid, the approach taken might have been inappropriate. The sister's reaction (blocking them) suggests that the communication method was hurtful.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's brother and father are advising to let it go implies that the author's approach isn't the only valid one. While the concerns about the dog's behavior and the sister's ability to handle it are legitimate, the way the information was presented and the lack of respecting her autonomy may make the author at fault. The sister might feel that her decisions as an adult parent are being undermined, especially when she's already made the choice to adopt.\n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the line between concern and overstepping is often about respecting boundaries. The author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, might not consider their sister's right to make her own choices, even if those choices carry risks. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for using a confrontational method to express their concerns.\n"
