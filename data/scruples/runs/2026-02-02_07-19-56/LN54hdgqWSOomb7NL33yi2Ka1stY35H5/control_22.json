But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about sending a list of reasons to their sister not to adopt a pit bull.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister wanted a dog for a long time, grew up not being able to have one because of the author and their mom. Now she's an adult, has kids, and adopted a pit bull. The author and mom are worried about the dog's safety, cost, and other issues. They compiled a list of arguments and sent it to the sister, leading to a fallout. Now the author is wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) by sending that list.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister is an adult, made her own decision, and the author and mom felt they had valid concerns. But sending a list after the fact might not be the best approach. The sister blocked them, and the family is divided.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own choices, even if others disagree. The author's intention was to prevent harm, but the method of sending a list might have been confrontational. The sister might have felt criticized, especially since she's already made the decision. The author and mom's concerns might be valid, but how they communicated it caused more harm. \n\nAlso, the sister is dealing with two pregnancies, so the stress from this conflict isn't helpful. The author's actions might be seen as not respecting her autonomy, even if they care about her well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue they were trying to help. But the approach was probably too aggressive, especially after the sister had already adopted the dog. It's possible the author and mom should have expressed their concerns earlier, not after the fact. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's concerns might be valid, but the way they handled it was wrong. Sending a list after the decision was made, leading to blocking and family tension, suggests they overstepped. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong).\n"
