But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister wanted a dog, grew up without one because the parents weren't fans. Now she's an adult with kids, and she adopted a pit bull. The author and mom made a list of arguments against this decision and sent it, which caused a family conflict. The sister blocked them and is upset, not wanting to come to Christmas dinner unless they stop criticizing the dog.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, respect for autonomy, and the method of communication. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own choices. The author and mom compiled a list and sent it, which might have come off as controlling or dismissive of her decision. Even if they had good intentions, the way they approached it could be seen as intrusive. They might have thought they were helping, but it's possible that their sister felt attacked or criticized, especially given the prior arguments.\n\nAlso, the list itself includes some questionable points. For example, the claim about pit bulls being responsible for a certain percentage of fatalities might be based on outdated or biased data. The author might not have considered that their sister has her own reasons for choosing a pit bull and might have done her own research. The list could also be seen as condescending, implying that their sister isn't capable of making a good decision, which could be hurtful given that she's a parent now.\n\nThe family conflict escalated, and the sister's reaction was to block them, which suggests the communication was hurtful. The author's brother and father are telling them to leave it alone, which might indicate that sending the list wasn't the right approach. The author's concern about the dog's impact is valid, but the method of addressing it was likely inappropriate. Instead of sending a list, maybe a more supportive conversation or expressing concerns without judgment would have been better.\n\nIn terms of ethics, intervening in an adult child's decision, even with good intentions, can be seen as overstepping unless there's a clear and present danger. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach definitely contributed to the conflict. The answer hinges on whether the method was respectful and appropriate. Since the sister felt criticized and it caused a family rift, the author's actions likely crossed a line, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
