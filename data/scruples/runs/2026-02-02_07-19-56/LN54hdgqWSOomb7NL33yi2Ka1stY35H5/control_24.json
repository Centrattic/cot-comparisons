But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The sister is an adult, making her own decisions. The author and their mom are against the adoption because of past experiences and concerns. But the sister has her own reasons and has already adopted the dog. \n\nThe key points here are: The author compiled a list of arguments and sent it to the sister, leading to her blocking them. The sister's partner says she's upset and considering not attending Christmas unless they stop criticizing the dog. The author's reasoning is based on safety concerns (like pit bulls being responsible for fatalities, the sister not being strong enough, etc.), but these could be seen as well-intentioned concerns or overstepping.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The sister is an adult and made her own choice. While the author's intentions might be to protect the sister from potential harm, the method of sending a list after the fact might be seen as undermining her autonomy. The family conflict escalated, causing a rift. \n\nHowever, the author did voice their concerns before the adoption, and then followed up with a list. The sister felt criticized, leading to blocking and family tension. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping because the sister is making her own decisions as an adult. Even with good intentions, pressuring an adult sibling about such a personal decision can be seen as wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of valid concerns. Pit bulls do have a reputation for aggression, and the sister's situation (pregnant, with a young child) does raise practical issues. However, it's up to her to weigh those risks. The author's role in the conflict might have been more about control rather than support. \n\nConsidering all this, the wrong here could be the author's approach. They should have respected their sister's decision after she made it, even if they disagreed. The list might have been an unnecessary intrusion. So the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
