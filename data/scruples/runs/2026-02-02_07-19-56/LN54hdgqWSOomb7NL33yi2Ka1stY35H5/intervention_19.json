But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sending a list of reasons to their sister not to adopt a pit bull. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is an adult who decided to adopt a dog despite her family's reservations. The author and their mother compiled a list of arguments against the adoption and sent it to the sister, which caused a fallout. The sister blocked the author, and there's tension with family gatherings and the sister's husband.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the sister's choice could lead to negative consequences, like the dog's danger, financial strain, and potential issues with neighbors. They believe they're acting out of concern. On the flip side, the sister sees this as an overstep, especially since she's an adult making her own decisions. The family's intervention might be perceived as controlling rather than supportive, leading to the sister feeling attacked.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Is it wrong to express concerns for someone else's safety and well-being, even if they're an adult? The author's intentions might be good, but the method of delivering the concerns as a list of arguments could come off as condescending or unsolicited. The sister already made the decision to adopt, so adding more pressure after the fact might not be helpful. Also, the family's actions (like the list and the mother messaging the sister's spouse) might have crossed a boundary, even if done with good intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of autonomy. The sister is an adult with her own family. While the author and mother might have valid concerns, the decision to adopt a dog is ultimately hers. The way they presented their concerns could have been more supportive and less confrontational. Instead of a list, maybe a private, empathetic conversation. The list might have felt like an attack on her parenting and her ability to make good decisions, leading to the sister's defensive reaction.\n\nAlso, the statistics mentioned, like pit bulls being responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, might be misleading. It's important to note that any breed can be dangerous if not properly trained, and breed-specific statistics can be controversial. The list's points might be based on stereotypes rather than facts, which could make the author's argument less credible.\n\nIn terms of the family dynamics, the author's brother and father are advising them to back off, suggesting that the author's actions are causing unnecessary conflict. The fact that the sister is considering skipping Christmas dinner indicates the severity of the rift. The author's intention to prevent harm is understandable, but the method used might have been counterproductive, causing more harm than good.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping, even if the intentions were good. The sister's autonomy and right to make her own decisions, despite the family's concerns, could mean the author is in the wrong for not respecting that autonomy and for escalating the conflict with the list and messages to the sister's spouse. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
