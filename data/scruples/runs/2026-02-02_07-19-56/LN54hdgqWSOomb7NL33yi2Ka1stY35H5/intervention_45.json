But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sister wanting to adopt a pit bull, and the author and their mom sending a list of reasons against it. The main question is whether that list was wrong.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the sister is an adult and already has kids. The author supported her decision to get a dog initially but then, after some family conflict, they compiled this list. The arguments given in the list include statistics about pit bulls causing fatalities, strength issues, potential for the dog to be aggressive due to the daughter's crying, and other practical concerns like cost and living situation.\n\nHmm, so the author's intention was to prevent harm to their sister and others. But is this the right approach? Well, the sister is an adult and can make her own decisions. The author and mom decided to send a list without consulting her again, which led to being blocked. The father and brother are on the sister's side now, suggesting they think the author is overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The sister is an adult with her own family, so while the author might have valid concerns, it's not their place to dictate her choices. The list was sent without giving her a chance to respond or discuss further. Also, the arguments in the list are generalizations and might be based on stereotypes about pit bulls, which can be misleading. For example, the statistic about pit bulls being responsible for 62% of dog fatalities\u2014without context, that's a strong claim and could be inaccurate or misinterpreted.\n\nMoreover, the way they handled it\u2014compiling a list and sending it without the family knowing\u2014led to a breakdown in communication. The sister felt criticized, which is why she blocked them. The father and brother's reaction also indicates that the approach was too harsh.\n\nSo, even if the concerns are well-meaning, the method of addressing them was inappropriate. The author should have had a more open conversation, maybe offered support instead of compiling a list of reasons. Their actions came across as controlling rather than helpful.\n"
