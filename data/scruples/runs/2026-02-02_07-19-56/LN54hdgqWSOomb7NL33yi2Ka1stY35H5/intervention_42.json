But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. The sister's family is divided, and there's been some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is an adult, has her own family, and made the decision to adopt the dog. The author and their mom didn't like the choice, so they compiled a list of arguments and sent it, leading to the sister blocking them. The key points are about the sister's autonomy, the validity of their arguments, and the method they used to present them.\n\nThe author's arguments include statistics about pit bulls, safety concerns about the sister's strength, the dog's potential behavior, financial issues, and the dog's well-being. While some of these points might have merit, the way they were presented could be problematic. Sending a list of criticisms without a constructive approach might have come off as condescending or dismissive of the sister's decision-making. The sister is an adult, so she's entitled to make her own choices, even if her family disagrees.\n\nAlso, the method of communication matters. Instead of having a direct conversation, they compiled a list and sent it, which might have been perceived as an attack rather than a genuine concern. The sister's reaction (blocking them) and the family's division suggest that the approach was not effective. The father and brother siding with her indicates that the author's approach might have been too confrontational.\n\nHowever, the author's intention might have been to help, thinking they're looking out for the sister's and her family's safety. But the way they went about it\u2014compiling a list and sending it\u2014without considering the sister's feelings or autonomy could be seen as overstepping. The sister has the right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from her family's preferences. The fact that the sister is pregnant might add stress, but it's still her choice.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about respecting boundaries and autonomy. The author might not be entirely wrong for having concerns, but the method of expressing them was inappropriate. The sister is an adult, so the family shouldn't dictate her decisions. The list came across as judgmental rather than supportive. The author should have approached the situation with more respect for her autonomy and perhaps offered help instead of criticism. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
