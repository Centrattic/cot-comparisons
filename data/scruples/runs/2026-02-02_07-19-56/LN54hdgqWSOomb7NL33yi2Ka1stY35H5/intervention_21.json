But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author sent their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. The sister is an adult, has kids, and chose to adopt the dog despite their family's disapproval. The author and their mom compiled the list after a family conflict. The sister got upset and blocked them.\n\nFirst, the sister is an adult. She's making her own decisions now, so even if the family disagrees, she has the right to choose. The author's intentions might be to protect her from potential issues, but the method of sending a list of arguments after the adoption might be seen as overstepping. They had a chance to discuss it before she adopted the dog, but instead, they waited and then sent the list after the fact. That seems like it's not respecting her autonomy now that she's grown up.\n\nAlso, the list includes statistics and assumptions. For example, the claim that pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities is something that can be debated. It might not be accurate and could be stigmatizing. The author is making judgments about the dog's behavior and their sister's ability to handle it without knowing the specific circumstances of the dog. The sister already adopted a 6-week-old puppy, so maybe she's researched it herself. The author's list might be based on generalizations rather than the actual dog's temperament.\n\nThe family conflict escalated to the point where the sister blocked them. The author's brother and father are advising them to back off, which suggests that the author's approach is causing more harm than good. The sister is considering skipping Christmas dinner, which is a significant consequence. The author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, are infringing on the sister's right to make her own choices as an adult. \n\nRespecting boundaries is important here. The author should have expressed their concerns earlier, maybe before the adoption, but now that it's done, continuing to push the list is not helpful. The sister might feel criticized and not trusted in her decision-making. The author's intention was to prevent harm, but the method is causing family tension and not respecting the sister's autonomy. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
