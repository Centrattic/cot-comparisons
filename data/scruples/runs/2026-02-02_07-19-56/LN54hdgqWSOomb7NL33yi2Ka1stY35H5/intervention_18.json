But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and their mother sending a list of reasons to their sister against adopting a pit bull. The sister blocked the author after this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is an adult making her own decisions. The author and their mother have personal issues with dogs due to past experiences. The sister already adopted the dog, and the family is divided. The list sent by the author and their mother includes various arguments about the risks of pit bulls, the sister's ability to handle them, costs, etc.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries. The sister is an adult, so she should have the autonomy to make her own choices, even if family members disagree. The author's actions of compiling and sending a list after the adoption might be seen as overstepping. Even though their intentions might be to help, the way they chose to communicate it\u2014especially after the decision was made\u2014could be disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the sister blocked the author, indicating that the message was unwelcome and hurtful. The family is already divided, and the author's actions added to the conflict. While the arguments in the list might have some validity, the method of delivery is problematic. It's possible that instead of sending a list, they could have had a more direct but respectful conversation, but even that might not be appropriate since the sister is an adult.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The sister is pregnant and has a young child; the stress from the family's pushback might affect her. The author's concern is valid but expressed in a way that caused more harm. The father and brother are advising against further criticism, which suggests the author's approach is not supported by the entire family.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were to protect their sister from potential dangers, the way they went about it\u2014compiling a list and sending it without her request\u2014was intrusive and likely caused unnecessary conflict. The sister's reaction (blocking) shows it was taken as an attack rather than a helpful suggestion.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they overstepped by providing unsolicited and potentially hurtful information after the adoption decision was made, leading to family conflict.\n"
