But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons to their sister not to adopt a pit bull. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The sister is an adult who decided to adopt a dog despite her family's concerns. The author and their mom compiled a list of arguments against it, which the sister found upsetting enough to block the author. The family is split, with some members supporting the sister and others worrying about the dog's potential risks.\n\nThe author's reasons include statistics about pit bulls and concerns about the sister's ability to handle the dog, the daughter's safety, property issues, costs, and the dog's living conditions. These points might be valid, but how were they presented? The sister felt criticized, leading to family tension. The author sent the list after a prior conflict, which might have been an escalation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were appropriate. Even if the concerns are legitimate, delivering them in a list after the adoption could be seen as overstepping. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being violated since she's an adult making her own decisions. The author's intention might have been to help, but the method could have been hurtful. Also, the sister blocking them shows the impact was negative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author thinks they're preventing future problems. But maybe they should have approached the sister privately before the adoption instead of compiling a list with the mother and then sending it. Family dynamics are complex here. The author's position might not be the \"asshole\" because they have valid safety concerns, but the way they handled it could be the issue. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the sister was an adult and made her own choice, the author's intervention might be crossing a boundary. The family conflict suggests that the author's approach wasn't constructive. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they interfered in a personal decision of an adult sibling, causing further strain without respecting her autonomy.\n"
