But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their sister a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister wanted a dog, which she wasn't allowed to have as a kid because the author and their mom weren't fans. Now she's an adult with two kids, and she adopted a pit bull. The author and mom are concerned about the dog's safety and other issues, so they made a list of arguments and sent it to her, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes statistics about pit bull fatalities, the sister's physical strength, potential triggers like a crying baby, neighbor issues, cost, and the dog's well-being. But the sister feels criticized and blocked them. The family is divided, with the father and brother siding with the sister, and the author thinks the impact is too big to ignore.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the sister is an adult and can make her own decisions. The author's intentions might be good, but using a list of arguments to pressure her could be seen as overstepping, especially after she's already made the adoption. They should have discussed concerns directly with her instead of compiling a list and sending it, which might come off as judgmental. Also, the sister felt disrespected, leading to her blocking them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and mom are worried about safety and the sister's ability to handle the responsibility. They might believe they're protecting her from potential harm. However, the method they used\u2014creating a list and sending it\u2014could be seen as invasive and not respecting her autonomy. Family dynamics are complicated here, but the sister's right to make her own choices as an adult is important.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-meaning but the approach was flawed. They should have communicated their concerns in a supportive way rather than presenting a list of criticisms. The sister's autonomy and their lack of right to dictate her decisions (as an adult) are key factors. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for how they handled the situation.\n"
