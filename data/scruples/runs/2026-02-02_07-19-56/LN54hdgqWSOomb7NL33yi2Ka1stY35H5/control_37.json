But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the sister wants to adopt a pit bull. The author and their mom aren't fans of dogs, each have their own reasons. The sister is an adult, has kids now, and decided to get the dog despite their concerns. The family had a big argument, and the author and mom made a list of arguments against the adoption and sent it to the sister, leading to her blocking them. Now, the author is worried they're the asshole because the family is splitting sides.\n\nFirst, the sister is an adult. The author mentions that they support her decision to get a dog but have concerns about pit bulls specifically. The list they compiled includes statistics about pit bulls being responsible for fatalities, the sister's ability to handle the dog, the daughter's crying triggering the dog, neighbor issues, high maintenance, financial costs, and the dog being bored in an apartment.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Since the sister is an adult, she has the right to make her own choices, even if her family disagrees. The author's intention was to voice concerns, but sending a formal list might have been an aggressive way to approach it. The sister felt criticized, leading to her blocking them. The author's mom even reached out to the sister's partner, which could have added pressure.\n\nThe arguments made in the list have some validity, like the strength of pit bulls and financial responsibility. However, some points might be biased. For example, the claim that pit bulls are responsible for a certain percentage of fatalities could be a statistic that's debated. Also, saying the sister isn't strong enough to control the dog could be an assumption without knowing her capabilities. The dog being a \"high maintenance\" and the apartment life might be subjective; some pit bulls can adapt well if properly trained.\n\nThe main issue is that the author and mom took it upon themselves to send a list of criticisms after the sister had already made the adoption decision. While they might have had good intentions, the method of communication was confrontational and possibly hurtful. The sister's reaction suggests she felt attacked, which is understandable. Even if their concerns are valid, the way they were presented might not be constructive. Family dynamics can be complex, but respecting the autonomy of an adult child's decisions is important unless there's immediate harm.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while stemming from concern, might have crossed a line by being overly critical and interfering in a personal decision. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the manner in which they approached the sister after she had already made her choice, causing family conflict and emotional harm. The key is that the sister is an adult, and the approach taken by the author and mom was not respectful of her autonomy.\n"
