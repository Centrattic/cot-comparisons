But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author and their sister adopting a pit bull. The author and their mom made a list of reasons against it and sent it to the sister, who then blocked them. The family is divided, with the author and mom on one side and the brother, father, and sister's partner on the other. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The sister is an adult, has kids, and decided to adopt a dog. The author and mom are worried about the dog's safety, maintenance, and potential issues. They compiled a list and sent it, leading to the sister blocking them. The author's motivations seem to be concern for the sister's well-being and safety, given the sister's living situation and financial constraints. \n\nBut then, the method of expressing concern matters. The sister is an adult, so she's supposed to make her own decisions. The author's approach of sending a list might have been too confrontational, especially after the sister already made the decision. Even if the concerns are valid, the way they were communicated could have been hurtful and intrusive. The sister felt criticized, which led to blocking them. The partner mentioned that she's upset and wants to avoid conflict, which suggests that the approach taken by the author and mom was not effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns about the dog's safety and the sister's ability to handle it might be legitimate. Pit bulls do have a reputation for aggression, though that's a topic of debate. The sister's situation\u2014limited income, living in an apartment, having young kids\u2014could make owning a high-maintenance dog challenging. However, the author's family members are advising to leave her alone, which might indicate that the author overstepped by compiling and sending the list without considering the sister's autonomy.\n\nThe key here is the boundary between concern and overstepping. While the author's intentions were to protect the sister, the method\u2014using a list and sending it directly\u2014might have been disrespectful. The sister was already a parent and made her choice, so the author's intervention could be seen as undermining her autonomy. The fact that the sister blocked them shows that the communication method was ineffective and hurtful. The author might not be the \"asshole\" entirely, but their approach was definitely wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes), because they overstepped, even if the concerns were valid.\n"
