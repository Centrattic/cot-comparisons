But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and their mother sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister. The sister had already adopted the dog, and there was a family conflict over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author and their mom are concerned about the dog's behavior, safety, and the sister's ability to care for it. They list several points about pit bulls being responsible for fatalities, the sister's physical strength, the dog's potential reactivity to the child's crying, housing issues, and financial costs. These are valid concerns, especially since pit bulls are often controversial. The author might believe they're looking out for their sister's and others' safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is an adult making her own choices. The author's actions led to a family rift, with the sister blocking them. The father and brother are advising to leave her alone, which suggests that the author's approach might be seen as overstepping. The sister's partner is also involved, indicating that the pressure is affecting her family dynamics. The author's intentions might be good, but the method of communicating these concerns\u2014sending a pre-written list after the fact\u2014could be perceived as confrontational rather than supportive.\n\nFamily dynamics are important here. The author's sister has her own life and children. The author's fear of large dogs from childhood and the mother's dislike might cloud their judgment. While the concerns are real, the way they're addressed matters. Direct communication that's respectful and offers support might be better than compiling a list and sending it without dialogue. The sister might feel criticized or not trusted as an adult, especially since she's already made the decision to adopt.\n\nAlso, the author's actions caused the sister to become upset and potentially withdraw from family events. This could be seen as the author not respecting their sister's autonomy, even if they have valid safety concerns. The key here is whether the approach was appropriate. The author might have valid points, but the method of delivery and timing (after the adoption) could be problematic. It's about balancing concern for safety with respect for another adult's decisions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions might be good, but the execution could be at fault. The sister's right to make her own choices, even if they're questionable, is important in an adult family dynamic. The author might be in the wrong for not supporting their sister's decision despite their concerns, leading to a breakdown in family relationships.\n"
