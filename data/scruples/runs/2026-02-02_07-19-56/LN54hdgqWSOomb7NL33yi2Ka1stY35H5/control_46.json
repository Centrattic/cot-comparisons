But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and their mother sending a list of reasons to their sister not to adopt a pit bull. The sister is an adult, has kids, and made her own decision. The family had some conflict over it, and now the sister is upset and blocked them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's autonomy. She's an adult, so she should have the right to make her own choices, even if her family disagrees. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping because they're interfering in a decision that's not their responsibility. The list they compiled could come off as judgmental and unsupportive, especially after the sister had already made the adoption decision.\n\nThe arguments in the list are presented as factual points, but some might be based on stereotypes. For example, pit bulls being responsible for a high percentage of dog fatalities might not account for the individual dog's temperament or the owner's responsibility. The author's fear from their own past with a dog might influence their opinion, but that's not the sister's experience. Also, mentioning her physical strength and potential issues with neighbors could be seen as condescending or not respecting her ability to handle the situation.\n\nThe family conflict escalated because of the list being sent, leading to the sister blocking them and not wanting to attend family events. This suggests that the approach was hurtful and counterproductive. Even though the author and mother had good intentions to protect the sister from potential problems, the method of communicating was inappropriate. They should have had a more direct, supportive conversation instead of a list that came across as critical.\n\nThe father and brother's advice to leave the sister alone indicates that their approach is wrong. The author's justification for their actions is based on long-term concerns, but respecting the sister's autonomy is more important. The author might not be malicious, but their actions disregarded the sister's right to make her own decisions and caused family tension. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
