But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister wanted a puppy for a long time but wasn't allowed before. The author and their mom aren't fans of dogs, the author had a bad experience with a large dog, and the sister is now an adult with two kids, limited income, and plans to live in an apartment. The author and mom compiled a list of potential issues with adopting a pit bull and sent it to the sister, which led to the sister blocking them and not attending Christmas unless they stop criticizing the dog. The author's father and brother support the sister's decision, but the author feels it's too risky.\n\nNow, the main question is about whether the author is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, this is a family conflict. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions. The author's intention was to help, but sending a list of arguments, especially after a tense situation, might come off as dismissive of her autonomy. Even if the concerns are valid, the method of addressing them could be problematic. The list might have been perceived as an attack rather than genuine concern. The sister's reaction of blocking and not attending Christmas suggests the message was hurtful and not received as constructive criticism. \n\nAlso, the sister has a child and another on the way, so the family's safety is a consideration. The author's argument is that the dog could be dangerous, expensive, or a burden. However, the sister might have done her own research and made a decision based on her current circumstances. The author's mom and the brother's support for the sister's choice indicates that the author's approach is not the only valid one. \n\nIn family dynamics, overstepping by providing unsolicited advice can damage relationships. The author's actions, though well-meaning, might have been more about their own unresolved feelings (like the past fear and their mom's disappointment) rather than the sister's best interest. The key here is whether the sister's decision to adopt a pit bull is within her rights as an adult and if the author's method of intervention was respectful and appropriate.\n\nThe author's concern might be valid in terms of potential risks, but the way they expressed it led to conflict. They should have considered the sister's autonomy and emotional response. The fact that the sister is upset and the family is divided is a sign that the approach was not constructive. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), because they didn't respect the sister's right to make her own decision and instead acted in a way that caused further conflict.\n"
