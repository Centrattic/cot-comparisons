But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons not to adopt a pit bull to their sister. First, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe sister is an adult, has kids, and decided to adopt a pit bull. The author and their mom compiled a list of arguments against it and sent it over, leading to the sister blocking them. The family had some conflict, but the sister is now upset about the criticism.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by sending the list. The sister is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions, even if the author disagrees. The list includes factual points about pit bulls, like aggression stats and financial considerations. But presenting these in a list might come off as judgmental, especially after the sister has already made the decision. \n\nThe author's intention was to protect their sister from potential harm, which is understandable. However, the method\u2014sending a compiled list after the adoption\u2014could be seen as invasive and disrespectful. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being questioned, especially since she's an adult with her own family. The fact that it led to a block and family tension suggests that the approach was problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's family is divided, with the brother and father advising to leave her alone. This indicates that the author's actions might not be in line with the family's consensus. While the concerns are valid, the way they were addressed could be the issue. Maybe a private conversation before the adoption would have been better, but sending a list after the fact and in front of others might have been harsh.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intentions were good, but the action of sending the list might be seen as crossing a line. The sister's right to make her own choices as an adult is important, and the method of confrontation could have been more respectful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their concerns were genuine.\n"
