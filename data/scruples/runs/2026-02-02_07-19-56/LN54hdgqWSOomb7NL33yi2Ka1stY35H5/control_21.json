But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a list of reasons to their sister against adopting a pit bull. First, I need to consider the context. The sister is an adult making her own decisions, which the author supports in general. However, the author and their mother compiled a list of arguments against the adoption out of concern. The key points here are the sister's autonomy, the family's right to express their concerns, and how the list was presented.\n\nThe author mentions that the sister is an adult with her own family, so she should be making her own choices. The list was sent without her consent, which could be seen as overstepping. The arguments provided by the author and mother are based on their concerns about safety, financial burden, and potential issues with the dog. However, these points might come off as dismissive of the sister's ability to handle the responsibility. The sister reacted by blocking the author, indicating that the approach was hurtful and not well-received.\n\nAnother angle is the family dynamics. The author's mother and brother are on the sister's side, suggesting that the author is in a minority here. The father and brother advising to leave her alone might indicate that the author's actions are seen as unnecessary interference. The sister's decision to block the author after receiving the list implies that the method of communication was inappropriate. Even if the concerns are valid, the way they're communicated matters. Sending a compiled list without a constructive dialogue could be seen as attacking her decision rather than offering support or advice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions might be to prevent potential harm, which is understandable. However, the execution\u2014compiling a list and sending it without the sister's input\u2014lacks respect for her autonomy and could be perceived as controlling. The family's reaction and the sister's response suggest that the approach was flawed. The author might not be entirely wrong in their concerns, but the way they addressed them is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to help, the method of communicating these concerns through a list without the sister's agreement or a respectful discussion is likely the issue. The sister has the right to make her own choices, and the author's approach could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
