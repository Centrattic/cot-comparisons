He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson gives up easily when the game becomes challenging, instead of trying to figure out solutions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven years old is pretty young, and kids at that age often have short attention spans and can get frustrated quickly. The parent might be trying to teach persistence and problem-solving, which are important life skills. However, forcing a child to finish a game could be seen as pressuring them, especially if it's against their will. \n\nThe author mentions that the stepson was playing a retro Sonic game. The specific challenge was a wall that required a power-up to blast through. The stepson tried for five minutes without success and then went to get his mom. The parent, in this case, the author, told him to come back and finish it. The child argued, but the parent made him stay and eventually finish the level. \n\nNow, the key points here are about the child's behavior and the parent's response. The parent is concerned about the child quitting on everything, which they want to correct. But is it appropriate to enforce this through a video game? Video games are typically for entertainment, and making a child do something they don't want to do, even if it's to teach a lesson, might backfire. It could turn the game into a chore, as the parent acknowledges they don't want it to be. \n\nAlso, the term \"forcing\" is important. If the parent is using authority to insist the child continue, even when the child is frustrated, that might be seen as harsh. At 7 years old, the child might not have the emotional maturity to handle that kind of pressure. The parent's approach could lead to resentment or a dislike of the game and maybe even learning in general if it's framed as a negative experience. \n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to teach the child not to give up. There's a balance between encouraging persistence and being overbearing. Maybe the parent could have used a different approach, like guiding the child to figure out the trick themselves instead of making them finish the level. For example, asking questions to prompt problem-solving rather than enforcing a rule. \n\nAnother angle is the stepson aspect. Stepchildren can sometimes face more complex dynamics, and the parent's role as a step-parent might involve different considerations. The child might not be used to the same expectations, and the parent's authority might need to be more carefully established. \n\nIn terms of general parenting advice, many experts suggest that it's important to validate a child's feelings and help them develop strategies to handle frustration rather than forcing them through tasks. Forcing the child might not teach them how to think through problems but rather to comply under pressure. \n\nOn the flip side, if the parent consistently allows the child to quit without addressing it, the child may not learn perseverance. So there's a middle ground where the parent can set expectations but also provide support and encouragement. The parent's reaction here seems to be a moment of frustration, which is understandable, but perhaps not the most effective method. \n\nThe stepson's behavior of not trying to solve the problem independently is a red flag, but the parent's method of making him finish the level might not be the best approach. It's possible the child could have learned the trick more effectively with guided problem-solving rather than being forced to continue. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Some parents might support strictness in teaching resilience, while others might see it as too harsh. The situation is subjective, but the key is whether the method is appropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is good, the method of forcing the child to finish the level might be considered in the wrong because it could be seen as using authoritarian tactics instead of fostering a supportive learning environment. The parent could have helped the child find the solution without making it a confrontation. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
