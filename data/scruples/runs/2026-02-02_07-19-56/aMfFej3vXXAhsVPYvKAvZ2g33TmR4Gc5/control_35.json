He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a stepson who's 7 years old. The author is trying to get him to finish a level in a video game. The kid is described as a \"constant quitter,\" giving up when things get challenging. In this case, the kid was playing a game where he needed to use a power-up to get through a wall but kept running into it without trying to figure out the solution. The author told him to come back and finish the level, even though the kid didn't want to. Eventually, the kid finished, and the author is concerned about teaching him to quit versus making games a chore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven-year-olds are still young and might not have the patience or problem-solving skills fully developed. They often give up when things get tough, which is a common behavior in that age group. The author's intention is to prevent the child from quitting, which is a good thing in terms of perseverance, but the method used is the key here. Was it appropriate to force the child to finish, especially when he was arguing and resisting?\n\nThe author mentions they weren't trying to make video games a chore but wanted to avoid raising someone who quits. However, forcing a young child to continue a game when they're frustrated might backfire. It could make them associate the activity with negative feelings, leading to more resistance in the future. The child's reaction (arguing) shows that he felt the pressure, which might not be the best approach for teaching problem-solving.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to encourage persistence, which is a positive trait. The line between teaching perseverance and causing unnecessary frustration is thin. Maybe there could have been a middle ground, like guiding the child through the problem or taking a break and returning to it later with a fresh perspective. The key issue here is whether the author's method was overly harsh for a 7-year-old.\n\nAlso, considering the parent's role as a step-parent, the approach might be different. The step-parent might need to be more careful in how they enforce rules, especially if the child is not their biological child. Building a relationship based on trust and encouragement rather than authority could be more effective in the long run.\n\nIn terms of the specific action\u2014forcing the child to finish the level\u2014it might not be the best strategy. Instead of forcing, guiding or offering help could teach problem-solving without making the child feel pressured. The author's intention is good, but the execution might have been too strict for a young child, potentially leading to resentment or a dislike for the activity.\n\nSo, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong: the answer might depend on the approach taken. The intention to teach perseverance isn't wrong, but the method of forcing the child to continue despite resistance could be seen as excessive for a 7-year-old. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the method used might not be age-appropriate and could have negative consequences.\n"
