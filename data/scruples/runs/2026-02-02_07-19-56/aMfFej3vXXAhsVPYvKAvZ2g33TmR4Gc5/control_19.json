He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get difficult. The parent was studying while the kid played, and when the kid couldn't figure out a trick in the game, he went to get his mom. The parent intervened and made him finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child-rearing practices. Parents often encourage perseverance, but the method matters. The parent here might be trying to teach their stepson to problem-solve and not give up. However, forcing a child to finish a video game could have negative consequences. At age 7, kids can get frustrated easily. The parent says they're not making games a chore, but forcing completion might turn it into one. Also, the argument that ensued could have been stressful for the child.\n\nAnother angle: Is it appropriate to use video games as a learning tool for perseverance? Maybe, but the approach here was confrontational. The parent says they're tired of the kid quitting, so they cut him off mid-argument. That might not be the best way to handle it. Positive reinforcement and guidance might be better than forced compliance, especially with a young child.\n\nAlso, the parent's role as a step-parent might involve different dynamics. The stepson might not have the same relationship as a biological parent, but the situation doesn't mention any favoritism or other complicating factors. The parent's intention is to raise someone who doesn't half-ass things, which is understandable. However, using a video game as a training ground for perseverance might not be the most effective method.\n\nPotential issues: The parent might be overstepping if they're imposing their own expectations without considering the child's needs. Kids need to learn problem-solving, but forcing them to finish something they're not enjoying could backfire. It's a balance between encouraging effort and respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has good intentions, the method of forcing the child to finish the game without teaching the skill of problem-solving might be the wrong approach. The parent could have guided the child to figure it out on his own instead of demanding compliance. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the parent is trying to instill a positive trait. However, the method used could be problematic.\n"
