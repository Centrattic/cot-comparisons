He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forcing their stepson to finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a quitter, especially when games require effort. The author intervened when the stepson gave up and didn't try to solve the problem, making him finish the level to avoid quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson is 7 years old, so he's pretty young. At that age, kids often struggle with frustration and persistence. The author's intention was to teach perseverance, which is a good lesson. But the method used\u2014forcing the child to finish\u2014might be harsh. \n\nChildren at 7 may not have the same level of self-control or problem-solving skills. The game required a trick he didn't figure out, which is part of the game's design. Expecting a young child to solve that alone without any guidance could be unrealistic. The author stepped in after the kid sought help from his mom, but instead of helping the stepson, they forced him to keep trying. \n\nForcing a child to continue without support might lead to frustration, resentment, or even a dislike for the activity. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with providing support and guidance. The author's approach might have been more about discipline than fostering problem-solving. Also, video games aren't inherently chores, so making it feel like one could have the opposite effect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wants to prevent the child from giving up easily, which is a valid concern. The key here is whether the method used was appropriate. Instead of forcing the child, maybe the author could have guided him to figure it out, encouraging him to think without making it a punitive task. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because the approach might be too forceful without adequate support for a 7-year-old. The child needed guidance rather than being forced to finish.\n"
