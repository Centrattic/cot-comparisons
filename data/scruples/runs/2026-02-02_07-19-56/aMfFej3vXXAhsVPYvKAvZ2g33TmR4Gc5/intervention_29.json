He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the stepmom) is in the wrong for making her 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" giving up when things get difficult. The mom decided to enforce that he must figure out the solution rather than quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 7, kids are still developing problem-solving skills and resilience. But they're also at an age where they might get frustrated easily. The mom is trying to teach persistence, which is a good life skill. However, the method used\u2014forcing the child to finish the level\u2014might be questionable. \n\nForcing a child to do something they're not ready for can lead to resentment or a negative association with the activity. Video games are meant to be fun for kids. If it's turned into a chore, even with good intentions, it might backfire. The child might start seeing games as a burden rather than a leisure activity, which could affect his motivation to engage in them or other challenges in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's intention is to encourage problem-solving and perseverance. These are positive traits. But the approach here seems authoritarian. Instead of forcing him, maybe guiding him through the problem or offering encouragement could be more effective. Also, allowing the child to experience natural consequences, like not finishing the level, might teach responsibility without the negative emotions.\n\nAnother angle is the mom's role as a stepmother. She might need to establish boundaries, but doing so in a way that respects the child's autonomy and emotional needs is crucial. The child might feel that his efforts aren't being acknowledged, leading to arguments. Communication is key here. Explaining why finishing the level is important and discussing strategies could be more beneficial than imposing a strict rule.\n\nAdditionally, the situation mentions that the child goes to his mom (the stepmom) for help when stuck. She intervenes by telling him to figure it out himself. While this is meant to encourage independence, it's possible that the child needs some guidance rather than being left to struggle. The balance between helping and letting him try is delicate. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method of forcing a young child to finish a level without considering his emotional state or providing support might be in the wrong. The mom's approach could be too harsh, potentially making video games feel like chores and not enjoyable. A more supportive and collaborative approach might be better for the child's development and relationship with challenges.\n"
