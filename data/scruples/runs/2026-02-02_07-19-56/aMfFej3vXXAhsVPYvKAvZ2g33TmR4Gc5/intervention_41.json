He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepfather making his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level instead of quitting when it gets hard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" giving up when things require effort. The dad was studying while the kid played a retro Sonic game. The kid kept trying to play the easy parts but got stuck on a wall where the trick is to use a power-up. He tried hitting the wall for 5 minutes without trying to solve it, then went to get his mom. The dad stopped him, told him to finish the level, and after arguing, the kid did.\n\nThe author says he's not making games a chore but doesn't want the kid to half-ass everything. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI should consider factors like the child's age, the approach used, and whether forcing the kid is appropriate. At 7, kids are developing problem-solving skills, but persistence can be taught. However, forcing a child to continue without considering their emotional state might not be the best method. The dad's approach involved confrontation\u2014cutting off the kid's argument and making him finish. While the intent is good, the method might be too harsh. It's possible the kid felt pressured, which could lead to resentment or a negative association with learning through games. Alternatively, encouraging problem-solving and offering hints might be more effective than forcing through. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because the approach was authoritarian rather than supportive. But others might argue it's necessary to build resilience. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A (wrong) because the method might be too strict for a young child without teaching problem-solving strategies first.\n"
