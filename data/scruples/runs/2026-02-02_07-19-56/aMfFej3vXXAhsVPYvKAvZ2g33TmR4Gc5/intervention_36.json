He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson quits when things get challenging. The author intervened when the kid was stuck and didn't try to figure out the solution, instead going to get his mom. The author told him to finish the level, leading to an argument but eventually the stepson completed it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the age of the child. He's 7 years old. At that age, kids are still developing problem-solving skills and perseverance. The author's intention is to prevent the child from giving up easily. But is it wrong to force a 7-year-old to keep trying when he's clearly frustrated? \n\nOn one hand, encouraging persistence is a good life lesson. The author wants the stepson to learn to tackle challenges. But on the other hand, forcing him to finish might be counterproductive. If the child is upset or resistant, making him finish could create negative associations with problem-solving. Also, the method used\u2014cutting off the argument\u2014might not be the best way to teach cooperation or critical thinking. Maybe there's a better approach, like guiding him through the problem without forcing him to stay until he's done.\n\nAlso, the parent is a step-parent. The dynamic might be different compared to a biological parent. The child might not respond as well to authority from someone who's not their biological parent, depending on the relationship they have. The author mentions the kid goes to his mom first, so maybe the stepson doesn't see the author as the primary authority figure here. That could affect how the child reacts to being told what to do.\n\nAnother angle: video games as a learning tool. The game is part of a gift, so it's supposed to be fun. If the challenge becomes too frustrating, the child's enjoyment is lost. The author's approach might be taking away the fun aspect, which could lead the child to dislike the game or avoid it altogether. Maybe the focus should be on teaching problem-solving strategies together rather than making him finish on his own under pressure.\n\nBut then again, the author wants to avoid raising someone who gives up. So there's a balance between teaching perseverance and respecting the child's feelings. The key might be in the method. Instead of forcing the completion, the parent could have encouraged the stepson to try different approaches, maybe offering hints or working through the problem together. That way, the child learns to problem-solve without feeling forced into a situation where he's unhappy.\n\nAlso, the time frame here is 5 minutes of trying. The stepson tried running at the wall, didn't figure it out, and went to get his mom. The author's intervention came after that. The duration might not be long enough for the child to fully engage in problem-solving. Maybe the parent could have stepped in earlier to guide, rather than letting the child struggle without help.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. While the intention is good, the method might be harsh. Forcing a child to finish a task without considering their emotional state could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's actions might be well-meaning, but the approach could be improved. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the authoritarian approach, but there's nuance here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer depends on the perspective. Some might argue that it's not the wrong approach because the parent is trying to teach persistence, but others might say it's too strict. Given the child's age and the potential for negative reinforcement, I think the answer is A.\n"
