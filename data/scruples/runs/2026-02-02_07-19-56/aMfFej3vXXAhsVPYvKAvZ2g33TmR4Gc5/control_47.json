He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a constant quitter, giving up when things get challenging. The parent, while studying, notices the stepson struggling with a game level and insists he figure it out instead of immediately asking for help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's intention seems to be teaching perseverance and problem-solving. The stepson tends to quit when things require effort, so the parent is trying to instill resilience. The situation is about a video game, which is typically seen as a fun activity, not a chore. The parent isn't making the stepson play games as a task but is encouraging him to overcome challenges within the game.\n\nNow, the key points to evaluate. Was the parent's approach appropriate? Making a child finish a level they're struggling with could be seen as pushing them to develop problem-solving skills. However, it's important to consider the child's age (7 years old) and whether the approach was too harsh. The parent cut off the child's argument, which might be seen as dismissive of the child's feelings. The child might feel pressured or frustrated, especially if the game is meant to be a relaxing activity.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a child to persist through challenges is a valuable life skill. The parent's motivation is valid\u2014raising someone who doesn't give up easily. However, the method might be questionable. Instead of forcing the child to finish the level, the parent could have guided the child to find the solution themselves, fostering independence without coercion.\n\nAnother angle: video games can be a way for children to unwind and have fun. If the parent is using game time as a way to enforce hard work lessons, it might not be appropriate. The child's enjoyment versus the lesson's importance. The parent should balance between encouraging perseverance and allowing the child to have unstructured playtime without pressure.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they are not making games a chore but want to avoid raising a quitter. The line between encouragement and force is thin. The parent's action of insisting the child finish might be seen as overstepping if it's not the child's choice. Kids need to learn to handle challenges, but it's important to respect their autonomy and emotional state.\n\nConsidering the child's age, a 7-year-old might not have the same problem-solving skills yet. The parent could have offered hints or encouragement instead of forcing completion. The child might need support rather than pressure. The parent's approach could lead to resentment if the child feels forced to do something they don't want to do, even in a game.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is good, but the method might be too forceful. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because the approach could be seen as overly strict, especially with a young child. However, some might argue that teaching perseverance is important, so the answer could be debated. But given the context and the child's age, the parent's method might not be the best approach.\n"
