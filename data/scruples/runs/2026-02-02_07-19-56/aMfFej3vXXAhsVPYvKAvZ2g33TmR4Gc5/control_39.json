He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepson who is a \"constant quitter\" and the stepdad made him finish a video game level because he wasn't figuring it out and kept asking for help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson is 7 years old. At that age, kids are still learning persistence and problem-solving. The stepdad was studying while the kid played Xbox. The game required some figuring out, and the kid just kept trying the same thing without thinking. The dad intervened and made him finish the level. The key points are: the dad's intention was to teach perseverance, the kid was struggling, and the dad didn't force him to play but made him finish what he had started.\n\nNow, the question is whether the dad was wrong. On one hand, forcing a child to finish a game might seem harsh, especially if it's taking too long and causing frustration. But on the other hand, encouraging persistence and problem-solving is important. The dad mentions he's tired of the kid quitting and not trying. The response might depend on how the dad handled it. If he was calm and explained the reasoning, maybe it's okay. But if he was authoritarian, that could be an issue. The dad also says he's not making games a chore, so he's trying to balance.\n\nAnother angle: at 7, kids can get easily frustrated. Making him finish might not be the best way if it leads to negative associations with problem-solving. However, the dad's intention is to teach a valuable life skill. The kid did finish eventually, so maybe the outcome was positive.\n\nPotential issues: Was the dad overstepping? The kid asked for help, which is normal. The dad might have been dismissive by not allowing the mom to help. Also, maybe the dad should have guided the problem-solving instead of just forcing the kid to figure it out. But the dad's approach was to let the kid learn by doing, which is a common parenting strategy.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions, methods, and the child's age. The dad's intention is positive, but the method might be questionable. However, given the age and the situation, some might see it as reasonable to encourage perseverance. Others might think it's too much to force a child to finish a game when they're stuck. The line between teaching resilience and being too strict is thin here.\n\nI think the answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the dad not being in the wrong because he's trying to teach a valuable lesson. However, there might be room for improvement in his approach. But according to the options, it's A or B. Since the community often supports parents who are trying to teach resilience, even if the method isn't perfect, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe some would argue A, but I think B is more likely.\n"
