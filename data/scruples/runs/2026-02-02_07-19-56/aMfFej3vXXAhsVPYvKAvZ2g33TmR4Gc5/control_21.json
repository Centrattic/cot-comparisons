He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" especially when things get challenging. The situation is that the kid was playing a game and when he hit a tricky part, he just kept trying the same thing without figuring it out, then went to get his mom. The author stepped in and told him to finish the level, and the kid argued but eventually did it.\n\nHmm. So the author's reasoning is that they don't want the kid to quit on everything, but they also don't want games to be a chore. The key points here are about perseverance versus pushing too hard. Is forcing a child to finish a game level a reasonable way to teach perseverance?\n\nFirst, maybe the author's intention is good. They want to encourage problem-solving and not giving up. But the method\u2014forcing the child to finish a level\u2014could be problematic. Kids can get frustrated, especially if the game is challenging. It might turn a fun activity into something they dread, which is the opposite of what they want. Also, the kid might not learn how to approach problems differently if he's just forced through it without guidance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author points out that the kid doesn't try to figure things out. Maybe the author is trying to teach him to stick with it. But is there a balance? Maybe offering hints or encouraging him to try different approaches would be better than making him finish it without any support. Also, the kid is seven years old. At that age, short attention spans and frustration tolerance are still developing. Forcing him might not be the best approach.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is studying while the kid plays. Is the parent's frustration affecting their judgment here? They might have been snapped at the kid's constant quitting behavior, leading to a harsher response than necessary. The line between teaching perseverance and being authoritarian is thin. Using a video game as a lesson might not be the right context if it's causing more stress.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the kid goes to get his mom when stuck. Maybe the mom is usually the one who helps, and the author is trying to step in to change that. But cutting off the kid's argument abruptly might not teach communication skills. The kid might feel disrespected or unsupported.\n\nIn terms of parenting advice, there's often a balance between support and autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong in this specific situation. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no), it's about whether their actions were wrong.\n\nI think the answer depends on the method. Forcing the child to finish without providing tools to solve the problem might not be effective. The parent's intention is to teach perseverance, but the execution could be flawed. However, the parent is also trying to address a behavior they see as problematic. It's a gray area, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to help the child develop persistence, even if the method could be better. Alternatively, if the method is too harsh, then A.\n"
