He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a quitter, giving up when the game gets challenging. The author, while studying, noticed the stepson struggling with a part of the game that required a trick, like using a power-up. The stepson tried for five minutes without success and then went to get his mom. The author intervened, told him to finish the level, and despite the stepson arguing, he eventually did it. The author's reasoning is to prevent the child from quitting and to encourage persistence.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether forcing the child to finish the level was wrong. I need to consider different angles. On one hand, the author is trying to teach perseverance, which is a good life skill. It's important for kids to learn to tackle challenges and not give up. But on the other hand, forcing a child to continue when they're frustrated might lead to negative emotions or resentment. The child might feel pressured and stressed instead of motivated. Also, the method used\u2014cutting off the argument and insisting\u2014might not be the best way to handle a 7-year-old's emotions. Maybe a more collaborative approach, like helping the child figure it out together, would be better than forcing them to keep playing.\n\nBut the author's intention is positive, to encourage problem-solving. The stepson's behavior of quitting when things get tough is a problem they want to address. However, the approach here was authoritative, not permissive. The key is whether the method was appropriate. Is it wrong to enforce this kind of learning through mandatory completion? Maybe it's a matter of balance. While teaching persistence is good, the child's emotional well-being and enjoyment are also important. If the child feels forced every time, it could backfire, making them associate effort with negative experiences. But the author did mention they aren't making games a chore, just trying to prevent half-hearted attempts.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for a more nuanced approach. However, according to the user's own thoughts, they think the author is in the wrong. But the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Given the situation, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention is good, but the method might be harsh. However, in many parenting circles, encouraging persistence is seen as positive. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. I should consider if forcing a child to keep playing when they're frustrated is harmful. Maybe the author should have guided the child instead of forcing them. Alternatively, it's a learning moment. I think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to teach a valuable lesson, even if the method could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they could do better. So if the action is not inherently wrong, then B. If it's considered wrong to force a child like that, then A. It's tricky. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
