He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepson who quits when things get tough in a video game. The parent made him finish the level, and now they're asking if that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parent is trying to teach perseverance. The stepson gives up when he needs to figure something out. The parent intervened to stop him from quitting. The parent's reasoning is to prevent the child from giving up on things that require effort.\n\nNow, I should consider different angles. On one hand, pushing a child to persist can be beneficial for developing problem-solving skills and resilience. It's good to encourage effort and not letting challenges defeat them. On the other hand, forcing a child to finish a game when they're frustrated might not be the best approach. It could lead to negative associations with gaming or learning. Also, the parent's role in this situation is important\u2014were they guiding the child or just making him suffer?\n\nThe parent mentions they wanted to avoid making games a chore but also not raise someone who half-ases things. It's a balance between encouraging effort and respecting the child's feelings. The parent's method was to enforce finishing the level, but maybe a better approach could be offering help or breaking it down into smaller steps.\n\nIs the parent wrong? If they forced the child without considering the child's emotions, maybe. But if they're trying to teach persistence in a reasonable way, perhaps not. The line between teaching resilience and being overly strict can be thin. The child is 7 years old, so developmental stage matters. At that age, patience and guidance might be more effective than strict enforcement.\n\nThe parent did step in when the child was not trying to figure it out, which could be necessary. However, the method\u2014arguing and cutting off the child\u2014might not be the best. Communication is key. Maybe the parent could have explained the importance of trying again instead of just making him finish.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is good, the approach might have been too harsh. However, it's a common parenting challenge. The answer might depend on whether the parent's actions are seen as reasonable discipline or as overstepping. The community's perspective on AITA often considers intentions, so the parent's motive to teach perseverance might justify their actions. But forcing a child to continue without support could be seen as wrong. Hmm.\n"
