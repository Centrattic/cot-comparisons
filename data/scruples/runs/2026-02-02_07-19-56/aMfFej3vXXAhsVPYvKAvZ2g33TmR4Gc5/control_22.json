He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson tends to give up easily when something gets challenging. The author intervened when the stepson was stuck and not trying to figure it out on his own. They forced him to finish the level, not wanting to raise someone who quits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author is trying to teach perseverance and problem-solving. It's important for kids to learn to handle challenges without giving up. Encouraging them to try harder when faced with obstacles can build resilience. The author is probably trying to help the stepson develop a growth mindset.\n\nOn the other hand, forcing a child to continue playing a game they want to quit might be stressful. It could lead to frustration or resentment. The stepson is only 7 years old, so his attention span and ability to handle stress are limited. Maybe there's a better way to encourage problem-solving without making it feel like a chore. Also, the approach of cutting off the child's argument might not be the best way to teach persistence. Communication and guidance might be more effective than coercion.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the stepson is a \"constant quitter,\" which might indicate a pattern of behavior that needs addressing. However, the method used\u2014forcing him to finish the level\u2014could be seen as authoritarian. It's important to balance discipline with empathy. The child's emotional needs should be considered as well. If the child is upset or frustrated, forcing him might not help in the long run.\n\nThere's also the question of the parent's role. The author is a step-parent, which can complicate dynamics. Establishing boundaries is necessary, but it should be done in a way that builds a positive relationship. Yelling or cutting off arguments might damage the relationship instead of fostering respect.\n\nIn terms of the child's development, teaching problem-solving is good, but the method matters. Maybe offering hints or allowing the child to take a break and come back later could be more effective. The goal is to encourage effort without causing aversion to the activity.\n\nI should also consider if the author's actions were appropriate given the age of the child. At 7, kids are still learning how to handle frustration and may need more guidance. The author's intention is noble, but the execution might be harsh. There's a line between teaching persistence and being overbearing.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention is to help the stepson develop perseverance, the method used might not be the most effective or considerate. The answer could hinge on whether the approach balances teaching a lesson with respecting the child's feelings and developmental stage.\n"
