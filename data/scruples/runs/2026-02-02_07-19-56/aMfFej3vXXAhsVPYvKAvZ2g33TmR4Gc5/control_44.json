He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson gives up easily when the game becomes challenging. The parent was studying while the kid played, and when the kid got stuck, he went to get his mom. The parent intervened and made him finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. Encouraging persistence can be good, but there's a line between teaching perseverance and being too strict. The parent's intention is to prevent the child from giving up, which is a valid goal. However, forcing a 7-year-old to play through frustration might not be the best approach. Kids that age have short attention spans and may not understand the concept of problem-solving in that context yet. The parent mentions not wanting video games to be chores, but they enforced it anyway.\n\nAlso, the child is a stepson, so there might be existing dynamics there. The parent's role as a step-parent could affect how their authority is perceived. The child went to get his mom, so maybe the parent's firmness is causing resistance. It's possible that the parent's approach is too harsh for the child's developmental stage. At seven, kids often need guidance and encouragement, not forced persistence without support. Maybe suggesting help instead of forcing them to struggle alone would be better.\n\nAnother angle: the parent might be trying to build problem-solving skills, but forcing the child to play until he finishes could lead to negative associations with the activity. If the parent is using this as a lesson in perseverance, there might be a better way, like offering hints or encouragement. Also, the parent was studying, so maybe they were stressed and took it out on the kid. The tone of the incident could have been more constructive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention is good, the method might be too strict for a young child. The parent isn't in the wrong entirely because teaching perseverance is important, but the approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the parent enforced a rule that might not consider the child's needs, the answer might lean towards A. But also, some might argue it's B because it's about discipline. It's a bit tricky. But given the child's age and the potential for negative reinforcement, the answer is probably A.\n"
