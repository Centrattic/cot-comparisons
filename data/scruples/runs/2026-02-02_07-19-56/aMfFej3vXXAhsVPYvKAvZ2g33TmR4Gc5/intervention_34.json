He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a quitter, quitting when things get tough. The author was studying while the kid played. The kid didn't realize a trick in the game, kept hitting a wall for 5 minutes, then went to get his mom. The author told him to come back and finish, leading to an argument but the kid eventually did it.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide. First, let's consider the context. The author is a step-parent, which can complicate dynamics. The kid is 7, so very young. The author is trying to teach perseverance. But is forcing a child to finish a game level appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author wants to prevent the child from quitting easily. Teaching problem-solving and persistence is good. On the other hand, a 7-year-old might not have the same level of self-control or maturity. Forcing them to continue without considering their emotional state could be harsh. Also, the child was seeking help from his mom, which is a normal response. The author cutting him off and making him finish could be seen as authoritarian, not allowing the child to express his needs or frustrations.\n\nVideo games can be frustrating, and for a young child, that frustration might be overwhelming. The author's approach might not be effective in the long term if it creates negative associations with problem-solving. Maybe there's a better way to encourage the child without forcing him. Like guiding him through the problem or offering help instead of making him finish it alone.\n\nBut the author's intention is valid\u2014raising someone who doesn't give up. However, the method might be too strict. The key is whether the author crossed a line. Forcing a child to do something without explaining or allowing them to process their emotions can be wrong. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with being supportive and understanding the child's developmental stage.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. The approach was too rigid and didn't account for the child's needs. The answer should be A.\n"
