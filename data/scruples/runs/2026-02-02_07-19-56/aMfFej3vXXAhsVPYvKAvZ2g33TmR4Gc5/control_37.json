He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson gives up easily when faced with challenges in the game, and the author decided to enforce finishing the level to teach perseverance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson is only 7 years old. At that age, children are still developing problem-solving skills and impulse control. The author mentions that the stepson tends to quit when tasks become difficult. The parent's intention is to encourage persistence, which is a positive life skill. However, the method used here is forcing the child to complete the level after he decided to quit. \n\nNow, the key points here: The child was playing a game, which is meant to be a recreational activity. The parent intervened by making the child finish the level, which turned a fun activity into something more stressful. The parent might be trying to instill a work ethic, but the approach could be counterproductive if it makes the child associate the game with frustration or obligation.\n\nAnother aspect is the parent's role as a step-parent. The dynamics might be different compared to a biological parent. The stepson might feel confused or pressured if the step-parent is enforcing strict rules without prior discussion. However, the parent does mention they were studying while the child played, indicating they were present and observed the behavior.\n\nThe child's reaction\u2014arguing and needing time to finish\u2014suggests that the interaction might have escalated tension. While the parent's goal is to prevent quitting in the future, the method might not be the most effective. Positive reinforcement, teaching problem-solving strategies, or allowing the child to experience the natural consequences (like not being able to advance) might be better approaches.\n\nHowever, the parent isn't making the child play games as a chore; instead, they are using the game as a context to teach perseverance. The line between teaching resilience and being overly strict isn't clear here. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the approach might be too authoritative for a 7-year-old. The child's autonomy in choosing when to stop playing is being overridden, which could affect his intrinsic motivation to play and learn.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has a valid concern about fostering perseverance, the method of forcing the child to finish the level could be seen as overstepping, especially given the child's age and the nature of the activity. The parent's intention is good, but the execution might harm the child's enjoyment and trust.\n"
