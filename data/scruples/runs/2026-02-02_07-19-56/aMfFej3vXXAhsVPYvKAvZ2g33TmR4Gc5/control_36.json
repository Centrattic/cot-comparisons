He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepfather making his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The kid tends to give up when things get challenging. The stepfather was studying while the kid was playing. The game required a trick\u2014using a power-up to blast through a wall. The kid tried hitting the wall for 5 minutes without success and went to get his mom. The stepfather told him to come back and finish it. The kid argued but eventually did.\n\nSo, the question is whether the stepfather is at fault. Let's break it down. First, the child is 7 years old. At that age, kids have short attention spans and might not grasp problem-solving techniques yet. The game's trick might not be obvious to a young child, especially if it's not intuitive. The stepfather's approach was to insist the kid figure it out, but is that appropriate?\n\nForcing a young child to persist might teach perseverance, but it could also lead to frustration or resentment. The stepfather's intention is to prevent the child from quitting, which is a good goal. However, the method\u2014telling the kid he has to finish and cutting off his argument\u2014might be harsh for a 7-year-old. The kid didn't try to figure out the trick on his own, but maybe that's because he didn't know how. The stepfather could have guided him instead of forcing him to finish without help.\n\nAlso, considering the stepfather's role, he's not the biological parent. How involved should he be in the child's learning? It's a gray area. The child's mother might have a different approach. The stepfather's action might be seen as overstepping if it's not aligned with the mother's parenting style. But if the mother is supportive, maybe it's okay.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching problem-solving and not giving up on the first obstacle is important. The stepfather's frustration is understandable if the child is constantly quitting. However, the way he handled it\u2014arguing and insisting without offering support\u2014might not be the best approach. Maybe a better way would be to walk the child through the problem or encourage him to try different strategies.\n\nIn terms of video games as a chore, the stepfather says he doesn't want to make them a chore, but by forcing the kid to finish, he might be turning playtime into something unpleasant. The balance between encouraging perseverance and respecting the child's autonomy is tricky here.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the stepfather's intention is good, but the method might be too harsh for a 7-year-old. The child might need guidance rather than being forced to figure it out alone. Therefore, the stepfather might be in the wrong for not providing support and for handling the situation in a way that could be seen as authoritarian rather than nurturing.\n"
