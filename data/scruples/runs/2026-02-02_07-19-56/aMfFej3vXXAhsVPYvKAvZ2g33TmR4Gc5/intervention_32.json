He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepparent making their 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The kid tends to quit when things get challenging. The parent got frustrated and made him finish the level instead of giving up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven years old is pretty young. At that age, kids are still developing their problem-solving skills and patience. They might not have the same persistence as adults. The parent is trying to teach the kid not to give up, which is a good life lesson, but the method might be questionable. Forcing a child to finish something, especially when they're struggling, could be seen as harsh. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with understanding the child's developmental stage.\n\nThe parent mentions that the kid goes to his mom when things get tough. The parent stepped in and told him to figure it out, which might have been a way to encourage independence. However, the way it was handled\u2014cutting off the child's argument and making him finish\u2014could be seen as authoritarian. Is it wrong to push a child to overcome challenges? Maybe not necessarily, but the approach matters. Encouraging problem-solving without forcing could be more effective. Also, the child might feel frustrated or pressured, which could affect their attitude towards learning and trying new things.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is concerned about raising someone who \"half asses everything,\" which is a valid concern. Teaching resilience is important. But there's a line between teaching perseverance and being too strict. The child's emotional well-being is also a factor here. If the parent is making the child feel like they can't quit even when it's difficult, that might lead to negative feelings towards challenges or even the parent themselves.\n\nI think the parent has good intentions but might be overstepping by forcing the child to finish. At seven, kids need guidance, not necessarily punishment for not figuring things out. Maybe a better approach would be to help the child find strategies to solve the problem, rather than making them suffer through it alone. The parent might be in the wrong here because the method used could be harmful in the long run, even if the intention is good.\n"
