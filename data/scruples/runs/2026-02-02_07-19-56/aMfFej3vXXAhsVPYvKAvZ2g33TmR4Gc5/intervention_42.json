He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the stepfather) is in the wrong for making his stepson (7 years old) finish a game level when the kid wanted to quit. \n\nFirst, the situation: The kid plays a game, and when he hits a challenging part, he tries a simple approach, fails, and goes to get his mom. The stepfather intervenes, tells him to figure it out, and the kid eventually finishes. The stepfather wants to teach persistence but not make games a chore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider child development. A 7-year-old is still learning problem-solving skills and may not have the executive function to stick with difficult tasks. Insisting he finish might be pushing too hard without considering his developmental stage. Also, forcing a child to do something they're struggling with can create negative associations, making them avoid challenges in the future. That could reinforce the \"quitter\" behavior the father is trying to prevent.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's intention is to teach perseverance. But the method might be counterproductive. Instead of forcing, maybe guiding or encouraging with support could be better. For example, helping the kid figure out the power-up instead of making him struggle alone. The father also mentions not wanting games to be chores, but making him finish could turn playtime into a chore.\n\nAnother angle: The father was studying and the kid was playing. The dad might have been frustrated with the kid's constant quitting. But reacting by forcing completion could be a power struggle. The kid's behavior is age-appropriate; trying to solve problems with help is natural. The dad's approach might be too rigid for a child's learning process.\n\nSo, considering all that, the father's actions might be well-intentioned but not the best approach. The answer could be A (in the wrong) because the method could hinder the child's intrinsic motivation and problem-solving development without effective teaching alternatives.\n"
