He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson is a \"constant quitter,\" and the author intervened when he tried to quit a challenging part of the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson is seven years old. At that age, kids often need guidance and encouragement, but also have limited attention spans. The author mentions that the child tends to give up when faced with challenges, which the author is trying to address. The parent's intention seems to be teaching perseverance, which is a good value. However, the method used\u2014forcing the child to finish the level without considering his emotional state or the situation\u2014might be problematic.\n\nForcing a child to do something, especially when they're frustrated, could lead to negative associations with the activity. Video games can be a fun way to learn problem-solving, but if the child is made to feel pressured or punished for struggling, it might turn them off from the game or learning altogether. The parent says they don't want the child to see games as a chore, but forcing completion could contradict that. \n\nAlso, the parent intervened directly by telling the child he had to finish, which might not give the child the autonomy to try and figure it out on his own. Maybe the parent could have encouraged the child to keep trying without forcing it, perhaps by offering help or setting a positive example. The child's reaction\u2014arguing and needing to finish eventually\u2014suggests that the approach might not have been the most effective in the long term.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to foster resilience, which is important. But the approach here seems harsh for a seven-year-old. The line between teaching perseverance and being overbearing isn't clear, but in this case, the parent's method might have crossed it. So, considering all that, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their intention was good.\n"
