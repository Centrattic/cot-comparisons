He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepson who gives up easily on a video game. The author forced him to finish a level after he kept trying to quit, because the stepson didn't realize there was a trick to get through a wall. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to raise someone who quits easily, but they also don't want games to be chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. He's 7 years old. At that age, kids have short attention spans and might get frustrated quickly. Video games can be challenging, and if a part is too hard, a kid might give up because they don't know how else to approach it. The author's stepson ran into the wall for five minutes without figuring it out. That's a long time for a 7-year-old, and it's possible he was trying but just couldn't figure it out.\n\nThe author's approach was to tell the child he had to finish the level. While the intention is to teach perseverance, the question is whether the method was appropriate. Forcing a child to continue a task they're struggling with might lead to frustration or resentment. It's important to balance teaching problem-solving skills with allowing the child to feel supported. Maybe guiding the child to find the solution instead of making him finish alone would be better. However, the author did step in to encourage persistence, which is a positive life lesson.\n\nAnother angle: the stepson went to get his mom, which the author called out, but maybe the author should have helped the child figure it out together instead of forcing him to finish. The line between teaching perseverance and making the child feel pressured is thin here. The author's motivation is commendable, but the execution might be harsh for a young child.\n\nAlso, the child might not yet have the problem-solving skills to figure out the trick on his own. The power-up trick wasn't obvious, so expecting a 7-year-old to figure it out alone without hints or assistance could be unrealistic. The author might have been trying to push the child, but maybe the game's design is part of the issue. If it's a retro game, the mechanics might be different from what the child is used to, making it harder to understand.\n\nIn terms of parenting style, some might argue that it's important to let children experience frustration as part of learning, but others might feel that the author was too strict. However, the key is whether the approach was harmful. Since the author's goal is to prevent quitting and the stepson eventually finished, maybe the outcome isn't negative. But if the method caused distress, that could be a problem.\n\nOverall, the answer isn't clear-cut. The author's intent is good, but the method could be questioned. The stepson's age and the complexity of the game's challenge are factors. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there are considerations about how to support the child better while teaching perseverance.\n"
