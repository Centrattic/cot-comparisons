He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the stepdad is wrong for making his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The kid keeps quitting when things get tough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. Seven is young, so their ability to stick with challenging tasks is developing. The dad noticed the kid gives up easily and tried to encourage persistence. But the method here was to force him to finish the level, right? The kid was frustrated, went to get his mom, but the dad said no and made him continue. \n\nNow, the dad's intention is to teach the kid not to quit. That's a good goal, but the approach might be an issue. Forcing a young child to keep doing something they're struggling with could lead to resentment or a dislike for the activity. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with understanding the child's emotional needs. Maybe the dad could have helped the kid solve the problem together instead of insisting he do it alone. \n\nAlso, video games for kids are meant to be fun. If the dad is making it feel like a chore, that might backfire. The kid might start seeing games as something he's forced to do, which could reduce his intrinsic motivation to play or learn.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The dad cut off the argument, which might not be the best way to handle it. Letting the kid express frustration and then guiding him could be more effective. The dad might be right in wanting to prevent giving up, but the method of enforcement without considering the child's feelings could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention is good, the approach might not be the best for a 7-year-old. The dad might be in the wrong because forcing the child without support or empathy could harm the child's experience and the parent-stepchild relationship.\n"
