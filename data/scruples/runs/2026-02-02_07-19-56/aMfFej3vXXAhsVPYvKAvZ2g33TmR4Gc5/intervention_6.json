He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level.\n\nFirst, the context: The stepson tends to give up when things get challenging. The author noticed the boy wasn't trying to solve the problem and instead went to get his mom. The author then told him to come back and finish the level. The stepson argued, but eventually did finish. The author's intention is to prevent the child from quitting easily.\n\nNow, considering typical parenting approaches. At 7 years old, children are learning persistence and problem-solving. It's common for parents to encourage perseverance. However, the method used here is a bit strict\u2014telling the child he \"needs to figure this out\" and cutting off his argument. The key here is whether the approach was appropriate.\n\nThe author is right to want to foster a growth mindset. But the enforcement might be too harsh for a child this age. Forcing a young child to finish something without explaining the reasoning or offering support could backfire. It might lead to resentment or negative associations with problem-solving. Also, the child is in a new environment with a step-parent, so trust and positive reinforcement are important.\n\nHowever, the author isn't making the child play games as a chore but is using a game as a teaching moment. The intention is good, but the method could be improved. Maybe guiding the child through the problem, praising effort, and offering help in a way that encourages independent thinking would be better than forcing compliance.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, teaching perseverance is important. On the other, the approach might be too authoritarian. The child's emotional needs and the parent's role in building a positive relationship should be considered. The answer might hinge on the balance between discipline and empathy.\n\nSo, while the author's intention is valid, the method could be problematic. However, parenting is complex, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The situation is more nuanced than a simple right or wrong. But given the question is asking whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer leans towards B (No), but with the caveat that there's room for a more supportive approach.\n"
