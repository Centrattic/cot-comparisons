He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The author's stepson is described as a quitter, giving up when things get challenging. The situation is that the kid was playing Sonic, encountered a wall he couldn't get past because he didn't realize he needed a power-up. He tried for 5 minutes, then went to get his mom. The author told him to come back and finish it, leading to an argument, but eventually he did it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. They provided their own thought, so I need to consider the other side. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to teach perseverance. They didn't want the kid to give up when things get hard. That's a valid concern. Parents often encourage persistence in children to build resilience. So, from that angle, maybe the author isn't wrong. But on the other hand, forcing a child to finish something they clearly want to quit might be problematic, especially if it's not a real-life necessity and is just a video game. \n\nVideo games are meant for fun and leisure. If the author is making it a lesson in persistence, that's understandable, but the method might be harsh. The stepson is only 7 years old. At that age, discipline from a parent can sometimes cross into being too strict. The author mentions the kid is a \"constant quitter,\" but maybe there's an underlying reason the kid isn't trying\u2014like frustration, lack of interest, or maybe different learning styles. \n\nAlso, the author says they're not trying to make games a chore, but forcing the kid to finish the level could be turning it into a chore. The argument that followed might have been stressful for the child. It's possible the author overstepped by not allowing the child to move on to something else he might enjoy more. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a step-parent. That dynamic can be more complex. The stepson might feel that the step-parent is being too strict compared to his biological parent. The author's approach might not align with the mother's parenting style, which could create tension. If the mother usually allows the kid to quit, the author stepping in might be inconsistent, confusing the child.\n\nBut then again, consistency in parenting is important. If both parents agree on teaching perseverance, then it's good. But here, the author might not have discussed this approach with the mother first. Also, the fact that the kid went to get his mom suggests that he expects her to help, and the author overruled that, which might be seen as overstepping.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is trying to set a boundary and teach a life lesson. However, the method of forcing a child to finish a game when he's frustrated could backfire, making the child associate the activity with negative experiences. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with allowing the child to have enjoyable experiences.\n\nIn terms of age-appropriateness, a 7-year-old might not have the same problem-solving skills as an older child. The wall in the game might be too difficult for his skill level. Forcing him to figure it out without help might not be fair if the challenge is too high. Maybe the author should have guided him instead of making him figure it out alone.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the author's intention is good, but the approach might be too strict for a 7-year-old. The key issue is whether the method used is appropriate for the child's age and developmental stage. If the child is struggling and frustrated, forcing him to persist without proper support could be counterproductive. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there are aspects of this situation that could be improved.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to teach a valuable lesson, but there are nuances where they could have handled it better. However, given the strictness of the situation, some might argue A. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and given the intent to teach perseverance, maybe the answer is B. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because forcing a child to do something they don't want to do, especially in a context meant for fun, could be seen as wrong. Hmm.\n"
