He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author making their stepson finish a video game level because he tends to quit when things get challenging. The stepson was playing a game, hit a wall that required a trick (using a power-up to blast through), and instead of figuring it out, he tried for 5 minutes without success and went to get his mom. The author told him to come back and finish the level, leading to an argument but eventually he completed it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author is a step-parent, so the relationship might already have some dynamics. The child is 7 years old, so young. The parent is trying to teach perseverance, which is a good intention. However, the method used was force\u2014telling the child he has to finish, cutting off the argument, and making him do it despite his resistance.\n\nNow, the question is whether this approach is wrong. On one hand, teaching persistence is important, and encouraging problem-solving is good. On the other hand, forcing a child to finish something they're struggling with, especially in a video game, could be counterproductive. It might lead to frustration, resentment, or a dislike for the activity. Also, the child might feel pressured and not learn the problem-solving on their own if they're forced.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's motivation. They mentioned not wanting to raise someone who \"half-asses everything,\" which is a valid concern. But the method of \"forcing\" to finish might not be the best way. Maybe guiding the child to figure it out first, offering help if needed, rather than making it a mandate. The child could have learned from the parent's help or hints instead of just being told to keep trying until he gets it through sheer persistence.\n\nAlso, the context of the child's behavior: he quits when things aren't easy. The parent might be trying to correct that, but the approach could be too authoritarian. The line between teaching resilience and being overbearing can be thin. At 7 years old, the child is still developing impulse control and problem-solving skills. If the parent's response is more about control than teaching, that's a red flag.\n\nI should also consider if the parent considered other strategies first. Did they try to encourage the child to think of solutions, or did they just enforce a rule? If the parent had said, \"Let's see what you can do here,\" instead of forcing completion, maybe the outcome would be better. Forcing might not teach the child how to handle challenges autonomously.\n\nIn terms of the parent's tone and the child's reaction: the child argued, and the parent cut him off. That could stifle communication and make the child less likely to approach the parent in the future for help. It's important for the child to feel heard, even if the parent is setting boundaries.\n\nOverall, while the parent's intention is good, the method might be too harsh. There's a possibility that the parent is in the wrong because they didn't facilitate problem-solving but instead enforced compliance through force. The balance between teaching perseverance and respecting the child's autonomy is tricky here. The parent might need a more collaborative approach rather than an authoritarian one.\n"
