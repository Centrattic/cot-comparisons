He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level.\n\nSo the situation is that the stepson is a \"constant quitter.\" The parent was studying while the kid played a game. The kid plays fine when it's easy but gives up when it gets challenging. In this case, the kid kept trying to run into a wall without realizing there's a trick to get through. The parent told him he had to figure it out, and after some arguing, the kid finished the level. The parent says they're not trying to make games a chore but don't want to raise someone who half-asses things.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the parent is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's motivation. They wanted to teach the child persistence and not to give up when things get hard. That seems like a reasonable goal. However, the method used\u2014forcing the kid to finish the level\u2014might be the issue. At age 7, children are still developing their problem-solving skills and emotional regulation. Forcing a child to do something they're resistant to can create negative associations with learning and perseverance. It might also be seen as authoritarian rather than authoritative, not allowing the child to explore solutions freely without pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to instill a positive trait (persistence) in a way they see fit. They weren't making games a chore but setting a boundary for giving up. There's a balance between encouraging effort and respecting the child's autonomy. The parent's approach might have been too rigid, especially if the child wasn't open to it at that moment. Maybe a better approach would be to guide the child through the problem without forcing them, using encouragement and support rather than coercion.\n\nAlso, the parent's tone in cutting off the child's argument might have escalated the situation. Communication style matters here. But the intention was good. The key question is whether the method used was appropriate. Forcing a child to finish a game level could be seen as overstepping, especially if the child is not in the right headspace to handle the challenge. The parent might be right in wanting to prevent quitting, but the enforcement might be where they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's intention is valid, but the method may be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because of the approach taken, even if the goal is understandable.\n"
