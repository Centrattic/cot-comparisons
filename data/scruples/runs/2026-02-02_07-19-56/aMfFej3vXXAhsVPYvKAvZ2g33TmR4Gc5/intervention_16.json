He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" who gives up when things get hard. The author was studying while the stepson played, and when the kid couldn't figure out a part, he went to get his mom. The author then told him to come back and finish the level, leading to an argument, but eventually, the stepson finished.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to teach perseverance. It's common for parents to encourage kids not to give up easily. The stepson is only 7 years old, so developing problem-solving skills and resilience is important. The author might see this as helping the child learn to tackle challenges rather than quitting when it gets tough. The author also mentions they didn't want to make games a chore, but wanted to avoid raising someone who \"half asses everything.\" So their intention seems positive, aiming for character development.\n\nOn the other hand, forcing a child to continue playing when they're frustrated could be seen as pressuring them. If the stepson was genuinely stuck and overwhelmed, making him persist without help might increase his stress and make him associate the activity with negative feelings. Since he went to get his mom first, maybe he needed guidance, but the author refused to let him leave, which might escalate the conflict. Also, the child is only 7; his ability to handle frustration is still developing. The author's approach might be too strict, especially if it's done in a way that's not supportive. Instead of forcing, maybe guiding him through the problem or offering encouragement could be better.\n\nAnother angle is the context. The author was studying, so maybe they were stressed and less patient. The way the author handled the situation\u2014cutting off the argument\u2014might not be the most effective communication. While the intention is to build perseverance, the method could be harsh. It's important to balance teaching resilience with allowing the child to feel supported.\n\nBut considering the age and the developmental stage, some might argue that setting boundaries and encouraging effort is part of parenting. The stepson's behavior of quitting when it's hard is something the author is trying to correct. So, the action is about fostering a growth mindset. However, the approach could use more support rather than force. Maybe a compromise would be better, like helping the child figure it out instead of making him play until he finishes on his own.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to teach perseverance, the method of forcing the child to finish without providing help might be too harsh. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the approach might not be developmentally appropriate and could be seen as authoritarian rather than supportive. Alternatively, if seen as a reasonable way to encourage problem-solving, then not in the wrong (B). I'm leaning towards A because forcing a child in a frustrating situation without guidance might be counterproductive and not consider the child's emotional state.\n"
