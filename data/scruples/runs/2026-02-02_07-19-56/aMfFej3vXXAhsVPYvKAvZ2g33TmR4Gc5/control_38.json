He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for forcing their 7-year-old stepson to finish a level in a video game. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get challenging. The parent was studying while the kid was playing Sonic on Xbox. The kid didn't realize a trick in the game to get past a wall\u2014needed a power-up to blast through. He tried hitting the wall for five minutes and then went to his mom. The author (stepdad) told him to come back and finish, and the kid argued but eventually did it. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to raise someone who half-asses everything, but they also don't want games to be a chore.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. Seven years old is pretty young, and their attention spans and problem-solving skills are still developing. The kid might not know how to handle the challenge, which is a normal part of learning. The parent's goal is to teach perseverance, which is a good value. However, the method used\u2014forcing the kid to finish the level\u2014might be problematic.\n\nForcing a child to do something, even with good intentions, can have negative consequences. It might make the child associate the activity with stress or punishment, turning something they enjoy into a chore, which is exactly what the parent says they don't want. Also, a 7-year-old might not understand the long-term benefits of perseverance in that moment. Instead of forcing, maybe guiding the child through the problem, encouraging them, or teaching problem-solving strategies would be more effective.\n\nThe parent mentions the kid's tendency to quit, but it's important to consider why. Is the child getting frustrated? Does he not know how to approach challenges? At that age, children often need support and modeling rather than being forced. The parent's approach might come off as authoritarian rather than authoritative. Authoritative parenting involves setting boundaries but also being responsive to the child's needs, which includes teaching them how to handle difficulties.\n\nAnother angle: the parent was studying while the kid was playing. Maybe the parent felt the need to set an example of working through problems, but the kid's behavior is developmentally appropriate. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method of response could be improved. For instance, explaining the trick, helping the kid figure it out, or encouraging them without forcing might be better.\n\nAlso, the parent says the kid \"doesn't try to figure it out at all.\" Maybe the kid is just not seeing the solution, not refusing to try. The parent could have helped the kid see the trick instead of making him finish it on his own. The kid's reaction of arguing and needing to finish might lead to resentment or a power struggle, which could be more harmful than helpful.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to teach perseverance, which is a positive goal. The line between teaching resilience and being overbearing can be thin. But in this case, the child is very young, and the approach might not be age-appropriate. The parent might have overreacted by cutting off the kid's argument and forcing compliance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intentions are good, but the method could be questioned. The answer might depend on cultural or personal parenting styles. However, most child development experts would suggest that encouraging and guiding is more effective than forcing, especially for a young child. So, the author might be in the wrong for the approach taken, even if the intention was good.\n"
