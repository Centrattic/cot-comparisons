He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this situation. The user is asking whether the stepdad was wrong for making his stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old and has a habit of quitting when things get tough. The dad was studying while the kid played. The kid was stuck on a part of the game that requires a trick, like grabbing a power-up to blast through a wall. The kid tried for 5 minutes without trying to figure it out, then went to get his mom. The dad told him to come back and finish it, leading to an argument but eventually the kid finished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child development. At 7 years old, children are learning perseverance and problem-solving skills. It's important for them to experience overcoming challenges. However, the method the dad used might be a point of discussion. Forcing a child to finish something could backfire if it's perceived as punitive. The dad's intention was to teach persistence, which is a good goal. But was the approach appropriate?\n\nThe dad mentions he's not trying to make video games a chore. But making the child finish despite resistance might turn it into a negative experience. The dad cut off the argument, which might have made the child feel dismissed. The key here is balance. Encouraging problem-solving without being authoritarian. Maybe guiding the child to figure it out instead of forcing him to keep playing.\n\nAlso, the child's reaction is important. If he was genuinely stuck and not understanding the game mechanics, maybe the dad could have explained the trick or helped him find a solution, fostering problem-solving rather than just persistence. Forcing him might not teach the skill of figuring things out on his own. The dad's frustration is understandable, but the approach could be improved.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative vs. authoritarian. Authoritative parents set boundaries but are responsive to the child's needs. Authoritarian is more rigid. The dad's action seems more authoritarian here, which could lead to resentment. The child might learn to finish tasks but not how to handle frustration or ask for help appropriately.\n\nHowever, the dad's intention is noble\u2014to prevent the child from quitting. It's a common parenting challenge. The line between teaching perseverance and being overbearing can be thin. The outcome was the child finished, but the process might have negative connotations. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some contexts, pushing through is valued; in others, it's seen as too strict.\n\nSo, considering all factors, is the dad in the wrong? It's a judgment call. He had good intentions but the method might not be the best. The child might feel that video games are a chore if forced, conflicting with the dad's stated goal. The answer could be A (wrong) because the approach might be too harsh, or B (not wrong) because teaching persistence is important. But given the context, maybe the answer is A since forcing might not be the right method.\n"
