He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for forcing their stepson to finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" giving up when things get challenging. The situation happened while the author was studying, and the stepson was playing a game. When he encountered a tricky part, he tried for five minutes without success and went to get his mom. The author stopped him and made him finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting approaches. The author's goal seems to be teaching perseverance. They mention not wanting to raise someone who quits, which is a common parenting goal. However, the method used here was to force the child to finish the level. The key points here are the child's age (7 years old), the nature of the situation (video game), and the parent's approach.\n\nAt 7 years old, children have limited attention spans and problem-solving skills. Forcing a child to continue a game they're frustrated with might not be the most effective teaching method. It could lead to negative associations with problem-solving or games. Also, the child went to get his mom, which might indicate he felt stuck or needed help. The parent's reaction was to stop him and insist he figure it out, which could be seen as dismissive of the child's need for assistance.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of intrinsic motivation. If a child is forced to continue an activity they find unenjoyable, they might lose interest or develop a negative attitude towards it. However, the parent argues that they don't want the child to give up easily. There's a balance between encouraging persistence and respecting the child's autonomy and emotional state.\n\nParenting styles matter here. Authoritative parenting encourages both discipline and support. In this case, the parent could have set a limit (like a time limit to try) while also offering guidance or encouragement, rather than making it a confrontation. The argument that ensued might have escalated the situation, making the child feel coerced rather than supported.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they were studying, which might have influenced their patience. Stress from their own work could have affected their reaction. It's important for parents to model the behavior they want to see, which includes managing frustration calmly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention to foster perseverance is understandable, the method of forcing the child to finish without considering the child's needs or emotions might be seen as harsh. The right approach would balance teaching problem-solving with empathy and support. So the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
