He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepdad making his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The stepson tends to give up when things get challenging, and this time the stepdad intervened by making him finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven years old is pretty young. At that age, kids are still developing their problem-solving skills and patience. The stepson was trying to play a game he got for Christmas, which is probably a gift he's excited about. The stepdad noticed the kid was stuck and not trying to figure out the trick (like grabbing a power-up to blast through a wall). Instead of helping, the stepdad told him to come back and finish the level, leading to an argument.\n\nThe stepdad's reasoning is that he doesn't want the kid to be a quitter and doesn't want him to half-ass things. But is forcing a 7-year-old to figure it out on his own without any guidance appropriate? The kid was trying for five minutes, then asked for his mom. The stepdad said no help and made him finish. \n\nI should think about child development here. Young children often need guidance and encouragement, not just being told to figure things out on their own. The stepdad's approach might be fostering perseverance, but it could also be seen as being overly strict or not considering the child's ability to problem-solve at that age. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were studying while the kid was playing. Maybe they felt the kid wasn't putting in effort and wanted to teach him a lesson. However, the method used could be problematic. Instead of letting the kid struggle without any help, maybe a better approach would be to guide him through the problem, showing him how to find the power-up. \n\nForcing a child to finish a game level when they're stuck, especially without providing any hints or support, might lead to frustration and resentment. The stepdad's actions could be seen as harsh, especially if the child was genuinely stuck and not just being lazy. The line between teaching perseverance and being unreasonably strict can be thin. \n\nAdditionally, the kid was arguing, which indicates he felt upset. The stepdad cut him off, which might have been to end the argument, but not addressing the child's feelings could be a mistake. The goal is to teach problem-solving and resilience, but it's important to do so in a supportive way. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because forcing a young child to solve a problem without any assistance when they're clearly stuck could be too harsh. The stepdad's approach might not be fostering the positive traits he's aiming for and could be causing the child unnecessary stress.\n"
