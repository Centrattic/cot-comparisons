He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old, and the parent mentions he's a \"constant quitter.\" The situation is that the kid gets frustrated when a game requires effort, runs to his mom, but this time the parent intervened, told him to figure it out, and he eventually finished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven is pretty young, and kids at that age often have short attention spans and can get easily frustrated. The parent is trying to teach perseverance, which is a good life lesson. But the question is about whether forcing the child is wrong.\n\nThe parent says they're not trying to make games a chore, but they don't want the kid to give up on things. The parent's approach was to insist the child finish the level despite the argument. But is forcing a child to keep playing a game when they're frustrated the best approach? Maybe there's a balance between encouraging persistence and respecting the child's feelings.\n\nI should think about child development principles. Encouraging problem-solving is positive, but forcing a child to continue when they're upset might lead to resentment. The parent could have offered help or taken a break instead. Also, the parent might be projecting their own standards onto the child. The kid is just 7; expecting him to independently figure out game mechanics might be too much without guidance.\n\nAnother angle: the parent was studying, so maybe they were using the game as a way to keep the child occupied. However, when the child struggled, the parent's response was to enforce completion rather than teaching how to solve the problem. The child might need scaffolding\u2014hints or encouragement rather than being forced.\n\nIs it wrong to make a kid finish? It's a judgment call. The parent has a right to set boundaries, but the method could be problematic. The key is whether the approach teaches perseverance without being authoritarian. If the parent's method is causing the child to associate effort with negative experiences, that's a problem. On the other hand, teaching resilience is important.\n\nIn the end, the parent's intention is good, but the execution might be flawed. The answer might be that the parent isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to teach a valuable skill, but there could be a better way. However, according to the options, the answer is either A or B. Considering the situation, the parent's actions are not wrong, so B.\n"
