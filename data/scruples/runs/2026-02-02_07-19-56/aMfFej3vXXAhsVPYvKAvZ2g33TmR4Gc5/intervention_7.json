He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" and the parent intervened when the child wasn't trying to solve a game problem, instead going to his mom for help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They wanted to teach persistence and problem-solving. They weren't forcing games as chores but wanted to prevent the child from giving up easily. On the other hand, the parent is using a video game as a method to teach this lesson. But is that appropriate?\n\nI should think about the child's age\u20147 years old. At this age, kids often have short attention spans and might struggle with frustration. Making them sit through something they're not enjoying could be counterproductive. Also, the parent mentions the child \"starts to argue and I cut him off.\" That might indicate a lack of communication or understanding of the child's feelings.\n\nAnother angle: video games as a learning tool. Some argue that games can teach problem-solving, but forcing a child to continue might turn them off from the activity altogether. The parent's approach might be effective in the short term but could harm the child's intrinsic motivation.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to build perseverance, which is a positive trait. The key is balance. Maybe instead of forcing the child to finish, the parent could have guided or encouraged him to try different strategies. The parent's method was firm, but was it wrong?\n\nAlso, considering the step-parent relationship. The parent might have a different dynamic compared to a biological parent. They might need to be careful about overstepping or not being in line with the other parent's approach.\n\nSo, the parent's motivation is good, but the method might be questionable. Forcing a child to engage in an activity they're frustrated with could be seen as authoritarian. The child's emotional response (arguing) suggests that the parent's approach might not be the most effective. There's a possibility that the parent is trying to teach a lesson, but the way they enforced it could be harming the child's autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has good intentions, the method used might be too harsh for a 7-year-old. The child needs guidance and encouragement, not force. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the child's emotional state and used a forceful approach instead of a more supportive one.\n"
