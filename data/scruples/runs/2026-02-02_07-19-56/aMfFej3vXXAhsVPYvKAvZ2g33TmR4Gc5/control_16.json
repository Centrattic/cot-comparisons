He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is the stepfather of a 7-year-old boy. The kid is described as a constant quitter. He starts things but quits when they require effort. The stepfather was studying while the stepson played an Xbox game. The game was a retro Sonic game they bought for Christmas. The kid plays fine when it's easy, but when there's a challenge (like a wall that needs a power-up to blast through), he immediately goes to his mom for help. This time, the stepfather said no and told him to finish the level. The kid argued, but eventually did it. The author isn't making games a chore but wants to prevent the kid from quitting.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for forcing the stepson to finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider age-appropriate behavior. A 7-year-old is young, and problem-solving can be challenging. Kids at that age often look for the easiest way out or seek help when frustrated. The stepfather's intention is to teach persistence, which is a good life lesson. However, the method used\u2014forcing the child to finish the level\u2014might be questionable. Was the child given enough guidance or just told to figure it out on his own? If the child tried for 5 minutes without success, maybe the stepfather could have offered hints instead of demanding he solve it alone. \n\nAlso, the child going to get his mom is a natural instinct when faced with a challenge. The stepfather's reaction was to stop him from seeking help, which might have caused frustration. Arguing and cutting off the child could be seen as harsh, especially for a young kid. The key here is whether the stepfather is fostering resilience or just enforcing unnecessary frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent wants to prevent the child from giving up in the future. Video games can be a good way to teach problem-solving. But forcing a child to continue without support might lead to negative associations with games and challenges. Balance is important: encouraging persistence while providing support when needed.\n\nIs the stepfather's approach too strict? Maybe. The child might have needed guidance rather than just being told to finish. However, the parent's intention is positive. The main issue is the method. If the parent is trying to build resilience but not allowing the child to seek help, that's a problem. But if the child is learning to think through problems, that's good. The stepfather's line about not making games a chore is important. If the child ends up hating games because of this, the method backfired.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The parent's goal is valid, but the approach might be too forceful for a 7-year-old. The child's behavior is age-appropriate; he's seeking help when stuck, which is normal. The parent's reaction could be seen as overstepping by cutting off the child's natural problem-solving method (asking for help) and forcing him to figure it out alone, which might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the parent's method was too strict without providing necessary support, leading to potential negative consequences for the child's problem-solving and emotional well-being.\n"
