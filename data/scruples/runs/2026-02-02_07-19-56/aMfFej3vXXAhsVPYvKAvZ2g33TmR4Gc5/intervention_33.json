He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepfather making his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level because the kid keeps quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven years old is pretty young. Kids that age often have short attention spans and might not stick with tasks that are challenging. They might get frustrated easily, especially if something requires problem-solving. The parent mentions the boy runs into a wall repeatedly without trying alternative solutions. That's a common issue with young kids; they might not see the game as a problem to solve but just as a series of actions.\n\nThe parent's intention seems to be teaching persistence. That's a good goal, but the method used might be problematic. Forcing a child to continue a game when they're clearly frustrated could lead to negative associations with the activity. It also depends on how the parent approached it. If it was done in a supportive way, maybe with encouragement, but the parent here shut down the argument. That could make the child feel pressured or misunderstood.\n\nI should think about developmentally appropriate strategies. At 7, kids need guidance but also need to learn problem-solving on their own. Maybe the parent could have helped the child figure out the trick without forcing them to keep playing. For example, suggesting they take a break and come back later, or offering hints. Forcing the child to finish might not be effective if they're not emotionally ready to tackle the problem again.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions not wanting to make games a chore. By forcing the child to finish, they might be turning something meant for fun into a task, which contradicts their stated goal. The child's reaction of arguing and resistance indicates that the approach might not be fostering a positive learning experience.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's role as a stepfather. The child might already have complex emotions about the stepfamily dynamic. Adding pressure from a step-parent could be even more stressful. It's important for step-parents to build trust and rapport before enforcing strict rules.\n\nIn terms of discipline vs. teaching, the parent is trying to teach persistence, which is good, but the method could be more child-centered. Positive reinforcement and modeling problem-solving skills might be more effective in the long run.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent's approach might be seen as too harsh for a young child. While the intention is to teach perseverance, the method could be counterproductive. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
