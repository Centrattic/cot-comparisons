He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author making their stepson, who's 7 years old, finish a video game level even though the kid wanted to quit. The key points here are about the child's behavior and the parent's response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven-year-olds are still developing their problem-solving skills and perseverance. The stepson tends to give up when faced with challenges, especially when something requires more effort. The parent is trying to teach him persistence. \n\nThe parent's approach was to insist he finish the level, even though the child was frustrated and wanted to stop. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to raise someone who quits easily. On the other hand, forcing a child to continue might not be the best approach, as it could lead to resentment or a negative association with the activity.\n\nI should also think about the methods used. The parent cut off the child's argument and made him finish. While the intention is good\u2014to encourage persistence\u2014the method might be too authoritarian. Positive reinforcement or guidance might be more effective. However, the parent is trying to balance between being supportive and instilling perseverance.\n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional response. If the parent is constantly forcing him, it might backfire, making him dislike the activity or feel pressured. But the parent is trying to prevent the child from giving up on anything that requires effort.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that the parent is right in teaching a valuable life lesson. Others might say that the child's autonomy and emotional state should be considered more. The line between discipline and overstepping can be thin.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the parent could have offered help instead of forcing completion. Collaborating with the child to solve the problem might teach perseverance without the pressure. However, the parent's point is that the child often runs to his mom for help, so maybe the parent is trying to encourage independence.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to foster resilience, the method used might be too rigid. The answer could lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B) because they're trying to teach a valuable lesson, but the approach could be improved. However, the age of the child is a factor. At 7, expecting a child to handle frustration in this way might not be age-appropriate, possibly making the parent at fault (A). It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the parent's intentions are good, so the answer is B.\n"
