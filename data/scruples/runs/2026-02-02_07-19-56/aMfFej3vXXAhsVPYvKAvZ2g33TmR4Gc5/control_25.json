He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is the stepdad of a 7-year-old boy. The kid is described as a \"constant quitter,\" meaning he gives up easily when things get challenging. The scenario involves the stepson playing a video game, specifically a retro Sonic game they got him for Christmas. The kid plays fine when it's easy, but when there's something tricky, like a wall he needs to blast through with a power-up, he doesn't figure it out and instead goes to his mom. Today, the stepdad decided to intervene, told the boy he needed to finish the level, and even though the kid argued, he eventually did it. The author mentions they're not trying to make gaming a chore but want to prevent raising someone who half-asses things.\n\nSo the main points are: the stepdad made the kid finish the level to prevent him from quitting, the kid tends to give up when challenges arise, and the stepdad's intention is to encourage perseverance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider if making a 7-year-old finish a game level is appropriate. At that age, children are still developing problem-solving skills and persistence. However, forcing them to continue might not be the best approach. On the other hand, the stepdad is trying to teach a lesson about not quitting, which is a valuable life skill.\n\nBut then, is forcing the kid to finish the level the right way to teach that? Maybe there are other ways, like guiding him to figure out the trick without making him feel forced. The stepdad cut off the argument and didn't let the kid argue, which might come across as authoritarian. If the kid is frustrated, not allowing him to express that could lead to negative feelings.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's tone here is about preventing the child from \"half-assing everything,\" which sounds like he's trying to instill a strong work ethic. But with a 7-year-old, balance is key. Video games can be a fun activity, and making them feel like a chore might diminish their enjoyment, which is what the author also says they aren't trying to do. However, the approach taken might conflict with that, as forcing the completion could turn it into a chore.\n\nAnother angle: the kid is seeking help from his mom when stuck, which is a normal behavior. The stepdad is trying to redirect that to problem-solving. But forcing him to stay might not encourage independent thinking if he's just doing it out of obligation. Maybe encouraging him, offering hints, or praising effort would be better.\n\nAlso, the stepdad says he's tired of watching him quit. That indicates a pattern, so maybe this is a recurring issue. The stepdad's intervention is a response to a pattern, but the method might be too harsh. The key here is whether the stepdad's actions are proportionate. Making a 7-year-old finish a level he's stuck on might not be the best way to teach perseverance if it's done without considering the child's feelings or offering support.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative vs. authoritarian. The stepdad seems to be taking an authoritarian approach here by not allowing the child to argue and enforcing the rule strictly. Authoritative would involve setting boundaries but also being responsive to the child's needs. So maybe the stepdad is in the wrong for using an authoritarian method instead of a more supportive, authoritative approach.\n\nBut on the other hand, the stepdad has a valid concern about the child quitting. It's a common issue for kids, and teaching perseverance is important. The problem is the method used here. Forcing the child to finish without providing guidance or support might not be effective and could create resentment.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was too forceful and authoritarian, not allowing the child to express himself, and not teaching problem-solving in a constructive way. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to teach a valuable lesson. But given the child's age and the method used, the answer leans towards A.\n"
