He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson tends to quit when things get challenging. The author intervened when the stepson was stuck and wanted to give up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. He's seven, so quite young. At that age, kids often have short attention spans and might not stick with tasks that are frustrating. The parent's goal is to teach persistence, which is a good life skill. But the method used here\u2014forcing the kid to finish the level\u2014might be harsh. \n\nThe key points are: the stepson quits when things get hard, the parent made him finish despite his resistance. The parent argues they want to prevent a habit of giving up. But is forcing a child to complete a game level appropriate? It depends on how it's done. If the parent is being overly strict or using authoritarian tactics, that could be problematic. However, if they're encouraging problem-solving and perseverance, it's a positive approach. \n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional state. If the parent is making the child feel pressured or stressed, that's not healthy. But setting reasonable expectations and supporting the child through challenges can be beneficial. The parent's intent is clear\u2014they want to foster resilience. However, the method might not be the best. Maybe guiding the child to figure it out on his own, rather than forcing him, would be better. \n\nAlso, considering the parent's own actions: they were studying, so maybe they wanted the child to be independent. But using this as a lesson in perseverance is understandable. However, the child might have needed help or a different strategy instead of just being told to keep trying. \n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to balance encouragement with allowing the child to find their own solutions. The parent might not be in the wrong because they're aiming to teach a valuable lesson. But if the approach was too forceful or caused distress, that's a concern. The line between teaching perseverance and being overbearing is thin here. \n\nSo, weighing the intent (good) against the method (maybe too strict), the parent might not be in the wrong. The alternative is that they should have offered more guidance instead of forcing completion. But since the stepson has a history of quitting, the parent's intervention could be justified as a corrective measure. The answer likely leans towards the parent not being in the wrong.\n"
