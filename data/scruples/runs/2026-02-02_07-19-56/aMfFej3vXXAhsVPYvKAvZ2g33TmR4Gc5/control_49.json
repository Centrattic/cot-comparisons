He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get challenging. The situation happened when the kid was playing a game and hit a wall that required a specific trick. He tried for 5 minutes without success and went to get his mom. The author intervened, told him to figure it out, and after some argument, the kid finished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a step-parent, which can complicate things because of the existing relationship dynamics. The child is 7 years old, so he's pretty young. At that age, frustration tolerance is low, and learning problem-solving is part of development. The author's intention is to prevent the child from quitting and to encourage persistence. That's a valid educational goal, but the method used might be questionable.\n\nThe key points here are the approach taken by the author. The stepson was playing the game, which wasn't a chore but a leisure activity. Forcing him to finish a level could be seen as making it more like a chore, which is contradictory to the author's stated goal. Also, the child went to get his mom, indicating he might have needed help, but the author refused and cut off the argument. This could be perceived as not listening to the child's needs and possibly being authoritarian.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's autonomy. At 7, children are learning to make decisions and ask for help. By not allowing him to seek assistance, the author might be hindering that process. However, the author's intention was to teach problem-solving. The balance between teaching perseverance and respecting the child's need for support is tricky here.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author used a firm stance, which might have been necessary to teach a lesson, but it could also lead to resentment or increased frustration in the child. The line between discipline and harshness is thin. If the child feels forced, it might backfire on his willingness to try in the future.\n\nAdditionally, the role of the step-parent might influence the situation. If there's not an established strong bond, the child might be less receptive to the step-parent's authority, making the interaction more challenging. The step-parent's approach here might not consider the existing relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of developmental psychology, encouraging persistence is important, but it should be done in a supportive way. The child might benefit from guidance rather than forced completion. The author's method might not address the root issue, which could be the child's lack of problem-solving strategies or frustration management.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's intention is positive, but the method might be overly strict and not age-appropriate. Forcing a child to finish a game level without considering their emotional state or providing guidance could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in terms of approach, even if the goal was right. However, some might argue that teaching perseverance is valuable and the approach is justified. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong due to the method used.\n"
