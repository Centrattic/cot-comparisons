He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the stepdad is in the wrong for making his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" who gives up when things get challenging. The dad intervened when the kid was stuck on a level, told him he had to figure it out, and the kid eventually finished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 7 years old, kids are still developing their problem-solving skills and perseverance. The dad's approach was to enforce completion, which could be seen as fostering resilience. On the other hand, forcing a child might lead to negative associations with learning or gaming.\n\nThe dad's intention was to prevent the kid from quitting when faced with a challenge. That's a valid concern because developing a growth mindset is important. However, the method used\u2014forcing him to finish without considering other strategies (like guiding him) might be heavy-handed. The key here is whether the dad's actions were appropriate for a young child.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. Arguing and cutting off the child's arguments could make the kid feel pressured or stressed. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with respecting the child's autonomy. The dad mentions not wanting games to be a chore, but his approach here might contradict that by making it feel like a task he has to endure.\n\nAlso, the kid sought help from his mom, which is a natural response. The dad's reaction to \"call BS\" and enforce completion might have been a reaction to the mom's usual approach. But in doing so, he took over the situation, which might not have been the best way to handle it. Maybe a better approach would be to guide the child through the problem without forcing him to finish the level.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, some experts advocate for encouraging problem-solving without coercion. Forcing a child to finish a level might not teach the child how to solve problems independently; it might just teach them to comply out of fear of not getting their way. The dad wants to avoid raising someone who quits, but the method could be counterproductive if the child feels it's not their choice.\n\nHowever, the dad's intention was positive. He's trying to instill persistence, which is a good trait. The question is whether the method used was appropriate. At 7, children need guidance and support rather than strict enforcement. The outcome was the kid finishing the level, but the process might have been stressful for him. The dad's approach could be seen as well-meaning but possibly misapplied.\n\nIn summary, while the intent is good, the method of forcing the child might be considered harsh for a 7-year-old. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the approach could be seen as too strict without alternative strategies. However, others might argue that it's necessary to teach persistence. But given the age and the emotional impact, the answer could be A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nThe key factors are age appropriateness and the method. Since the child is young, the approach should be more nurturing. Forcing him to finish without support might be wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
