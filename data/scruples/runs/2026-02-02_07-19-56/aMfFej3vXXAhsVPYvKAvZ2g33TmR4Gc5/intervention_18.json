He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for forcing their stepson to finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" who gives up when things get challenging. The author was studying while the stepson played, and when the kid encountered a difficult part, he went to get his mom. The author stopped him, insisting he figure it out. There was some arguing, but the kid eventually finished the level.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent's intention was to teach the child perseverance, which is a valid life skill. However, the method used might be questionable. The parent forced the child to continue without giving him the chance to seek help from his mom, which could be seen as dismissive of his need for support. Also, the parent was in the middle of studying, so maybe they were stressed and didn't handle the situation calmly.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's behavior of quitting when faced with a challenge might need addressing. The parent's intervention aimed to prevent the child from developing a habit of giving up. But using an authoritarian approach\u2014telling the child to \"come back and finish the game\" and cutting off arguments\u2014could be counterproductive. It might make the child feel unsupported or pressured, leading to resentment or a decrease in motivation.\n\nDevelopmentally, a 7-year-old is still learning problem-solving skills. The game's challenge might be beyond his current ability, and the parent's approach might not be age-appropriate. Instead of forcing completion, the parent could have guided the child through the problem, offering hints or encouragement. Allowing the child to ask for help (from his mom or the parent) while encouraging persistence could be a better balance.\n\nThe parent mentions not wanting games to be chores but also not wanting to raise someone who half-asses things. There's a tension here between fostering resilience and respecting the child's autonomy. The parent's action, while well-intentioned, may have crossed a line into being overbearing. It's possible that the child felt overwhelmed and needed assistance rather than being forced to struggle alone.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative approaches are generally more effective. This involves setting expectations while also being responsive to the child's needs. The parent here leaned towards an authoritarian style by not allowing the child to seek help and cutting off arguments. This might hinder the child's willingness to tackle challenges in the future if they feel unsupported.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent's method might be problematic. However, the intent to teach perseverance is understandable. The line between teaching resilience and being overly strict can be thin. The parent could have handled the situation by offering support instead of forcing the child to figure it out alone. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing a balanced approach that includes guidance and encouragement rather than just enforcing persistence.\n"
