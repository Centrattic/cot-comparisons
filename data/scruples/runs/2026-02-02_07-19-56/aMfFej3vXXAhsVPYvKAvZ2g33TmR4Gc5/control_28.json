He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" giving up when things get challenging. The situation involves the stepson playing a game and facing a challenge he doesn't figure out on his own, so he goes to get his mom. The author steps in to make him finish the level, leading to an argument, but eventually, the stepson completes it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. The stepson is 7 years old. At that age, children are still developing problem-solving skills and perseverance. The parent might be trying to teach him to handle challenges, which is a good life skill. But the method used here is forcing him to finish the level after an argument. \n\nThe author mentions they're not trying to make video games a chore but are raising someone who might half-ass things. So their intention is to foster persistence. However, forcing a child to finish a game might not be the best approach. The argument and the confrontation could have caused stress or resentment. It's important to balance teaching persistence with respecting the child's autonomy and emotional well-being.\n\nThe child's behavior of quitting when things get hard is a common issue, but the response should be constructive. Maybe redirecting his frustration or offering guidance instead of forcing him to continue could be more effective. However, the parent did intervene to encourage problem-solving, which is positive. The key is whether the method was appropriate. Forcing a child might backfire, making them associate challenges with negative experiences rather than learning to overcome them themselves.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's intention is good, but the execution might be questionable. The answer likely depends on context not provided, like the parent's usual approach. But based on the given info, the parent is trying to teach perseverance, and while the approach may have been harsh, the intent is valid. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how they handle it.\n"
