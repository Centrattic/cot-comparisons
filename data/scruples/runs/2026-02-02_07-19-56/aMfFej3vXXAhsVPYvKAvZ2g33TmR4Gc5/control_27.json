He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the stepdad is in the wrong for forcing his 7-year-old stepson to finish a game level. The situation is that the boy gives up easily when things get challenging, and the stepdad intervenes to prevent quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Seven years old is pretty young. At that age, kids often have short attention spans and might get frustrated quickly. The stepdad is trying to teach perseverance, which is a good life lesson. But the method here is forcing the child to finish the level. The key question is whether that's appropriate.\n\nForcing a child to do something can have negative effects. It might make the child associate the activity with stress or obligation, which could turn them off from playing games altogether. The stepdad mentions he doesn't want video games to be a chore, but his approach here might be counterproductive. Instead of forcing, maybe encouraging or guiding the child could be better. For example, helping the child figure out the trick, offering hints, or praising effort rather than forcing completion.\n\nAlso, the child went to get his mom, which the stepdad called BS on. That might come off as dismissive of the child's need for help. Maybe the stepdad should have offered assistance instead of cutting off the child's attempt to seek help. Collaboration could be more effective than confrontation.\n\nThe stepdad's intention is positive\u2014raising a resilient child\u2014but the method might be too harsh for a 7-year-old. The child's emotional response (arguing, giving up) suggests that the approach wasn't effective. There's a balance between teaching persistence and being overly authoritarian. Since the child is very young, the stepdad's approach might not be age-appropriate. So, the answer would lean towards the stepdad being in the wrong because the method of forcing might not be suitable for the child's development.\n"
