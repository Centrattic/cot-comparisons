He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old and has a habit of quitting when things get hard. The author was studying, the kid was playing a game. When the kid couldn't figure out a part, he ran to his mom. The author told him to come back and finish it, and he eventually did. The question is if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 7, kids are still developing problem-solving skills and persistence. The parent is trying to teach him not to quit, which is a common parenting goal. But forcing a child to finish a game level might not be the best approach. It could lead to frustration or resentment. The parent wants to encourage perseverance, which is good, but the method might be too strict.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they don't want video games to be chores, which suggests they understand the balance. However, forcing the child might take away his intrinsic motivation. Positive reinforcement or guidance might be more effective. The parent did intervene, but maybe there's a better way to encourage problem-solving without making it feel like a punishment.\n\nOn the other hand, the child is constantly quitting, so the parent is trying to instill a work ethic. It's a tough balance. The parent's intention is understandable, but the approach could be considered harsh. The key is whether the parent's action was reasonable. Since it's a 7-year-old, expecting persistence without support might not be appropriate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to teach a life skill, but some might argue it's too strict. However, the line between teaching persistence and being overbearing can be thin. The parent's reasoning is valid, so maybe B is correct.\n"
