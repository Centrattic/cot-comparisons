He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get challenging. The parent tried to let him play while they studied, but the kid would run to his mom when the game required effort. This time, the parent intervened and made him finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They say they don't want video games to be a chore but also don't want to raise a quitter. It seems like they're trying to teach perseverance. But is forcing a 7-year-old to keep trying when he's frustrated appropriate?\n\nAt 7 years old, kids have short attention spans and may not handle frustration well. The stepson was stuck for 5 minutes, which is a long time for him. The parent cutting him off and making him finish might have been stressful. However, the parent's approach could be seen as encouraging problem-solving skills. The key here is the method used. Yelling or being harsh might be problematic, but if the parent was firm but supportive, maybe not.\n\nBut the parent says they \"called BS\" and told him to finish, which might sound a bit harsh. Also, the stepson was arguing and the parent cut him off. That could be seen as dismissive of the child's feelings. Forcing a child to keep playing when they're clearly frustrated and want to stop might not be the best approach. Maybe offering help or taking a break would be better. However, the parent's goal is to prevent a \"half-assed\" attitude, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between teaching resilience and respecting the child's emotions. The parent's actions might be well-meaning but the method could be too strict for a young child. So maybe the parent is in the wrong (A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's a tough call either way.\n\nWait, the parent did make him finish, but the stepson eventually did it. Did the parent provide any support or just leave him to figure it out? The original message says the parent told him to come back and finish, so maybe they forced him to keep trying without help. That could be an issue. Kids need guidance, especially when learning to problem-solve. If the parent didn't help and just demanded persistence, that's not helpful. But if they encouraged and supported, it's different.\n\nThe trick in the game was to grab a power-up and blast through. The kid didn't realize that, so maybe he needed a hint. The parent's approach was to force him to figure it out alone, which might not be effective. Alternatively, maybe the parent was trying to teach him to try harder, but a 7-year-old might not have the cognitive ability to figure that out on their own. So the parent's method might be too harsh, leading to the kid feeling pressured instead of supported. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
