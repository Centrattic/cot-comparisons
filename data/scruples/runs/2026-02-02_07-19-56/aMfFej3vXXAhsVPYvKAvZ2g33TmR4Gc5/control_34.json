He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is seven years old, and the author mentions he's a \"constant quitter.\" The situation is that the kid was playing a game, hit a wall that required a trick (like getting a power-up to blast through), tried for five minutes without figuring it out, then went to get his mom. The author stepped in and made him finish it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven-year-olds are still developing problem-solving skills and can get frustrated quickly. The stepson might not have the patience or the cognitive ability to figure out the trick on his own, especially if he's used to getting help. The author's intention was to prevent the kid from quitting, which is a good goal, but the method\u2014forcing him to finish\u2014might be an issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they weren't trying to make games a chore. However, forcing a child to continue playing when they're frustrated could turn the activity into something negative. Video games can be a fun way to learn problem-solving, but if the challenge is too great without support, it might lead to stress instead of growth.\n\nThe key here is the approach. The author could have encouraged the child to try different strategies, maybe offered hints, or allowed a short break before returning. Instead, they cut off the argument and forced completion, which might not be the best way to teach persistence. Positive reinforcement and guidance might be more effective than coercion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's goal of preventing a quitting attitude is valid. It's important to encourage perseverance, but the method matters. The stepson might still be learning how to handle challenges, and the parent's role is to support that learning without making the child feel pressured or punished.\n\nIn summary, while the intention is good, the method used might be inconsiderate of the child's developmental stage. The author might be in the wrong for not using a more supportive approach that encourages problem-solving without forcing the issue.\n"
