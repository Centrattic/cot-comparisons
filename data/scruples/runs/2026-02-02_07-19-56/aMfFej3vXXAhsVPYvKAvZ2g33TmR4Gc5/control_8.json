He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old, and the parent says he's a \"constant quitter.\" The situation is that the kid was playing a game, hit a part where he needed a trick (like a power-up to blast through a wall), tried running into it for 5 minutes without figuring it out, went to get his mom, but the parent told him to come back and finish it. The kid argued, but eventually finished.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the age of the child. 7 years old is pretty young. Kids that age are still developing problem-solving skills and can get frustrated easily. The parent is trying to teach perseverance, which is a good life lesson. But the method here is being questioned. Was forcing the child to finish the level the right approach?\n\nThe parent mentions they weren't trying to make video games a chore but didn't want to raise someone who half-ases things. They intervened when the kid was about to quit. However, there's a line between teaching persistence and being too strict. At 7, kids might need more guidance and encouragement rather than being forced. The parent might have used this as a learning moment, but maybe they could have encouraged the child to figure it out on his own first, maybe offering hints rather than demanding he finish it.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the child goes to get his mom when stuck. Maybe the parent should have been the one to step in with a hint instead of forcing completion. The argument here is that the parent is trying to prevent a \"quitter\" attitude, but forcing a child to do something can sometimes lead to resentment or negative associations with the activity. It's possible the parent could have explained the problem, showed the power-up, or encouraged the child to try different approaches.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is good\u2014they want to foster resilience. But the method might be too harsh for a 7-year-old. The child is still learning, and video games can be a way to practice problem-solving. If the parent is always stepping in to make him finish, the child might not learn to solve problems independently. Alternatively, if the parent had said, \"Let's figure this out together,\" it might have been more effective and less confrontational.\n\nAnother angle: the parent was studying while the child was playing. Maybe the parent was frustrated with the child's behavior and used this as a way to enforce discipline. But reacting in the moment can sometimes lead to overstepping. The key is whether the parent's action was appropriate given the child's age and the situation.\n\nIn summary, while the intent is positive, the method of forcing the child to finish without providing guidance or encouragement could be seen as too authoritarian. It might be better to teach problem-solving skills through support rather than coercion. So the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the approach was too harsh for a young child, but I need to check if there's any other nuance I'm missing.\n"
