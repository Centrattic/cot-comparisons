He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get hard. The situation happened when the kid was playing a retro Sonic game and hit a wall that required a power-up to pass. He tried for 5 minutes without figuring it out and went to get his mom. The author told him to come back and finish it, leading to an argument but the kid eventually completed the level. The author's reasoning is that they want to stop enabling quitting behavior, not making games a chore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. 7 years old is pretty young. The child's behavior of giving up when something is challenging is developmentally common. Kids at that age might not have the patience or problem-solving skills to figure out tricky parts without help. The author's approach was to enforce finishing the level, which could be seen as trying to teach perseverance. However, forcing a child to sit through a frustrating situation might cause more harm, like resentment or anxiety.\n\nThe author mentions they weren't trying to make games a chore, which is a good point. But making a child finish a level when they're stuck could actually turn the activity into something negative. At 7, children need guidance and support, not punishment for struggling. The author's method might be too harsh for the child's developmental stage. Instead of forcing, encouraging the child to try different strategies with help might be more effective. Also, the author's reaction might not address the underlying issue of the child needing to build problem-solving skills or understanding that it's okay to ask for help sometimes.\n\nAnother angle is that the author stepped in when the kid was trying to get help from the mother. Telling the kid to come back and finish without assistance might be undermining the natural support system. Kids should feel comfortable seeking help when needed. The author's approach could be seen as invalidating the child's feelings of frustration. It's important to validate emotions before expecting a child to overcome challenges.\n\nIn terms of parenting strategies, it's about balance. Encouraging persistence is important, but so is recognizing a child's limits. The author might be projecting their own impatience or frustration onto the situation. The kid's behavior of quitting might be a cry for help in learning how to handle frustration, not just being lazy. The author's method of making the child finish without support could be counterproductive.\n\nHowever, the author's intention to prevent giving up is understandable. They want to raise a resilient child. But the method might be too strict for a 7-year-old. Alternative approaches could include breaking the level into smaller parts, offering encouragement, or modeling problem-solving techniques. The key is fostering independence while providing appropriate support.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to teach perseverance, the approach might be too harsh for a young child. The author could be in the wrong because they forced the child to continue without addressing the child's frustration or providing help. The solution should balance teaching perseverance with empathy for the child's developmental needs.\n"
