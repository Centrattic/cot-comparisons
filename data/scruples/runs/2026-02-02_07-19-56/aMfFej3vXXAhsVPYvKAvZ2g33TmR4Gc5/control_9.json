He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get difficult. The parent intervened when the kid was stuck and didn't try to solve the problem on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. The parent wanted to teach perseverance and not to quit when faced with challenges. They weren't making the game a chore but wanted the child to learn problem-solving. The child was stuck for 5 minutes and then went to get his mom, but the parent insisted he figure it out. The child eventually finished the level.\n\nOn the other hand, making a 7-year-old finish a game level can be seen as pressuring him. Kids at that age have short attention spans and might not handle frustration well. The parent's approach might have been too harsh, especially if it led to an argument. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with allowing the child to take breaks and not associate the activity with negative feelings.\n\nHowever, the parent's goal is to encourage persistence, which is a positive trait. The key is whether the method used was appropriate. Forcing the child without considering his emotional state could backfire. Maybe a better approach would be to guide the child through the problem rather than making him finish without help.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the stepson is a \"constant quitter,\" which suggests this is a recurring issue. The parent's intervention might be part of a broader effort to address this behavior. But the specific incident involved forcing the child to finish, which might not be the best strategy for a 7-year-old.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between teaching persistence and respecting the child's capacity to handle frustration. The parent's intention isn't wrong, but the method might be. So, the parent might be in the wrong for forcing the issue without a more supportive approach.\n"
