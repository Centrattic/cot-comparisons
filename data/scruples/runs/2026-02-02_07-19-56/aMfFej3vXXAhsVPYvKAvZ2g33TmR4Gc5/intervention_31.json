He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The story says the stepson often gives up when things get tough and instead of figuring it out, he goes to his mom. The author intervened this time, told him to finish, and he did after arguing.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the age of the child. He's seven, which is pretty young. At that age, kids can get frustrated easily, especially in games that require problem-solving. The parent's role here is to balance teaching persistence with not being too harsh. The author was studying, so maybe they were trying to model perseverance by making the kid stick with it. But forcing a child to finish a game might not be the best approach. It could lead to resentment or make the child dislike the game or even the parent. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to prevent the child from quitting too easily. Encouraging persistence is a good life skill, but the method here might be too authoritarian. Arguing and cutting off the child's argument could make the child feel unheard. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely because they're trying to teach a lesson, but maybe they could have found a middle ground, like helping the child figure out the trick instead of forcing them to redo it. \n\nAlso, video games can be a good way for kids to learn problem-solving, so maybe the parent's approach was a bit heavy-handed. Letting the child struggle a bit is okay, but forcing him to keep going without support might not be effective. The key is whether the parent is fostering resilience or just enforcing compliance. If the goal is to teach problem-solving, guiding the child through the challenge would be better than making him redo it without help. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for the approach taken, even if the intention was good. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a balance. Maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the parent's actions are seen as overly strict and not age-appropriate, then yes. If seen as a reasonable way to teach persistence, then no. The answer isn't clear, but leaning towards A because the method might be too harsh for a 7-year-old.\n"
