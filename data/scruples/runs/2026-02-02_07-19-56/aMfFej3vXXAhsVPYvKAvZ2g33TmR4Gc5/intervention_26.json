He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old. The parent was studying while the kid played. The kid gives up easily when games get challenging. In this case, the kid didn't figure out a trick in the game and kept hitting a wall for five minutes. Instead of helping, the parent told him to finish it, and the kid eventually did.\n\nHmm, so the parent is trying to teach perseverance. But wait, the kid is 7. At that age, kids might not have the same problem-solving skills or patience. Forcing a child to keep trying when they're stuck could be seen as harsh. Video games are supposed to be fun, not a chore. The parent mentions they don't want games to be chores, but they also don't want the kid to half-ass things. But is forcing a 7-year-old to figure this out reasonable?\n\nThe kid is a stepson. Maybe the parent feels a different responsibility, but they should consider the child's emotional well-being. Arguing and cutting off the kid might create conflict. Also, the parent is trying to teach a lesson, but maybe there's a better way. Like, maybe guiding the kid to figure it out instead of making him finish it alone. Or setting aside game time with clear expectations but not forcing him to keep trying if it's frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent wants to encourage persistence. It's a valid goal. But how it's being done might be the issue. The parent's approach could be seen as authoritarian. The kid might feel pressured and not learn the lesson if it's forced. Maybe the parent should have explained the strategy or helped him solve the problem, teaching problem-solving skills instead of just making him struggle alone.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The answer might depend on the approach. If the parent is trying to teach perseverance but is doing it in a way that's too strict, that could be problematic. Especially with a young child. The key is balance between encouraging effort and allowing the child to enjoy the game. The parent's actions might be well-intentioned but the method could be inappropriate. So maybe answer A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
