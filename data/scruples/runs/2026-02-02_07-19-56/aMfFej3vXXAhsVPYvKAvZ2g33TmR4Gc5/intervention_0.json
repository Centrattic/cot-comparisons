He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get challenging. The author intervened when the stepson was stuck on a level that required a trick, telling him to figure it out instead of immediately seeking help. The stepson argued but eventually finished.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child: 7 years old. At that age, kids are still developing problem-solving skills and perseverance. The author's intention was to teach the child to persist when faced with challenges, which is a valuable life skill. However, the method used\u2014forcing the child to finish\u2014might be an issue. The stepson was clearly frustrated and resistant, and being forced to continue could lead to negative associations with problem-solving or even the activity itself.\n\nThe key points are: the child is young, the situation was about a video game (which is a recreational activity), the parent's approach was firm, possibly without allowing the child to process the problem on their own. While the parent's goal is admirable, the way they handled it by cutting off the child's argument and forcing completion might not be the best approach. It's important to balance teaching perseverance with respecting the child's feelings and autonomy. Maybe a better approach would be to encourage the child without coercion, explaining the value of trying different strategies rather than insisting on finishing the level. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used could be too harsh for a 7-year-old, even if the intention is good. But I should also consider if the parent was within their rights to set boundaries. However, forcing a child to continue an activity they're struggling with might not be the right approach here.\n"
