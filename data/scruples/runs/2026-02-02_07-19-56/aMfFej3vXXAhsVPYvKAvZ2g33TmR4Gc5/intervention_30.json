He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a quitter, giving up easily when things get challenging. The situation happened when the kid was playing a game and faced a tricky part. He tried for a while, then went to get his mom, but the author intervened and told him to finish it. The kid argued, but eventually did it. The parent's intention is to prevent the child from quitting on everything.\n\nHmm. So the parent's perspective is that they're teaching perseverance, not wanting to raise a quitter. The stepson is 7, so a young child. Video games can be frustrating for kids, especially if they don't figure out the mechanics. The parent is trying to encourage problem-solving and persistence. But is this the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, pushing the child to keep trying can build resilience. It's a common parenting strategy to encourage kids to not give up. But on the other hand, forcing a child to finish a game might be seen as imposing unnecessary stress. Kids need to know it's okay to ask for help, right? The parent might have overstepped by not allowing the child to seek help from his mom initially. Also, maybe the parent is being too strict because the child is still young and might not have the same problem-solving skills as an adult.\n\nBut wait, the parent mentions that the child constantly quits. Maybe this is a pattern they're trying to address. The parent might be trying to teach a life lesson. However, the method could be harsh. Arguing and cutting off the child might create a negative association with the game and with problem-solving in general. Is it right to force a child to keep playing until they solve a problem when they're clearly frustrated?\n\nAlso, considering the age, 7-year-olds have limited attention spans and can get easily frustrated. The game's difficulty might be too high for his current skill level. The parent might not have considered that the child needs guidance or a break instead of being forced to keep trying. Maybe the parent should have helped the child figure it out rather than just making him keep trying alone.\n\nBut then again, the parent might be trying to encourage independence. The trick in the game requires figuring out a power-up. If the child isn't thinking to look for that, maybe the parent wants him to realize the solution on his own. However, if the child is stuck and not making progress, maybe the parent should have stepped in to guide him instead of forcing him to keep failing.\n\nSo, the key points are: the parent's intent is to prevent quitting, but the method might be too authoritarian. The child's need for support vs. the parent's need for the child to be persistent. The child's age and developmental stage are factors here. If the parent is consistently strict without providing guidance, that could be problematic. But if it's a one-time instance, maybe not. The parent could have helped the child solve the problem, which would teach both problem-solving and that it's okay to ask for help. Instead, forcing completion without support might just make the child resentful.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is good, but the approach might be too harsh. They might be in the wrong for not offering assistance and instead forcing the child to keep trying alone, which could be counterproductive. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
