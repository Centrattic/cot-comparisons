He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepson who quits things easily, and the author made him finish a video game level after he tried to give up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson is 7 years old. At that age, kids often have short attention spans and can get frustrated when something is challenging. The author mentions that the stepson quits when a task requires effort. The specific incident involves the child trying to get through a wall in a Sonic game by just running into it, not figuring out the trick. The author intervened, told him to finish the level, and the child eventually did.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze are the author's actions and their justification. The parent was studying, the child was playing, and when the child couldn't solve a problem, he went to get his mom. The parent stopped him, made him finish the level, and argued that the child can't just quit. \n\nI should think about parenting approaches. Encouraging perseverance is a common goal for parents. The author is trying to teach the stepson not to give up when faced with challenges. However, the method used could be questioned. Forcing a child to finish a game when they're frustrated might be seen as harsh, especially if the child is not used to such discipline. But the author's intention is to prevent the child from quitting easily, which is a valid concern.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age. A 7-year-old might not have the problem-solving skills for certain game mechanics. The parent's intervention could be helpful in teaching the child to think through problems rather than giving up. But the way it was done\u2014cutting off the child's argument\u2014might be too abrupt. It's possible the parent could have explained the trick instead of just making the child figure it out on his own.\n\nThe author states they don't want video games to be chores but also want to avoid raising someone who half-asses everything. Balancing these is tricky. Some might say the parent should model problem-solving by helping the child find the solution, while others might support the approach of letting the child struggle to build resilience.\n\nPotential issues: The parent might be overstepping by forcing the child to finish the level, especially if it's a learning moment. However, the parent's intention is to instill persistence. The child's behavior of relying on the mom for help is a red flag for the parent, so stepping in to correct that could be seen as necessary.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on the approach. Forcing the child without explanation could be seen as authoritarian. But if the parent is trying to teach a lesson and the child eventually learns, maybe not. The line between teaching perseverance and being overly strict is thin. The child's emotional response matters. If this is a one-time thing, maybe okay. If it's a pattern, it could be harmful.\n\nIn the end, the parent's method might not be the best, but the intent is to prevent quitting. The answer could lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because they're trying to teach a valuable life lesson, even if the approach could be improved. However, some might argue that forcing the child is wrong because it's punitive. But given the context, the parent's actions are within reasonable discipline for a child who needs to learn persistence.\n"
