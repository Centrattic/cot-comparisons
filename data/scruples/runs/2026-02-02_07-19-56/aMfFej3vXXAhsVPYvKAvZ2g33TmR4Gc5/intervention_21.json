He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a constant quitter, giving up when things get challenging. The author intervened when the stepson tried to give up on a tricky part of the game, forcing him to finish the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The stepson is 7 years old, so he's pretty young. At that age, kids often have short attention spans and might not understand the concept of perseverance yet. The author's intention was to teach the stepson not to quit when faced with challenges. That's a valid concern, as persistence is an important life skill. However, the method used here might be questionable.\n\nForcing a child to finish a game could backfire. If the child is forced, they might associate the activity with negative feelings, leading to aversion. The author mentions that they aren't trying to make games a chore, but the approach here might be turning it into one. The stepson was trying to seek help from his mom, which is a natural response when stuck. By cutting him off and insisting he figures it out alone, the author might be overstepping. Collaboration and problem-solving together could be a better approach.\n\nAlso, the child's emotional well-being matters. If the author is being harsh or argumentative, that could damage their relationship. The stepson might feel frustrated or pressured, which isn't healthy. Discipline should ideally be constructive. The author's goal is good, but the method might not be the most effective. Instead of forcing the child, maybe guiding him to figure it out with support would teach perseverance without the negative connotations.\n\nBut then again, the author is trying to instill a positive trait. There's a balance between teaching resilience and being too strict. The line between teaching and being authoritarian can be thin. If the author is consistent and uses this as a learning moment rather than punishment, it could work. However, the way it was handled\u2014cutting off the child and making him finish without help\u2014might not be the best strategy. It's possible the author is right in wanting to teach perseverance but wrong in the approach. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because the method was too harsh and could harm the relationship or the child's interest in the game.\n"
