He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the stepson gives up easily when things get challenging. The author stepped in when the kid was stuck, told him to figure it out, and made him finish the level.\n\nHmm. So, first, what's the issue here? The author is a step-parent, which might complicate things. They mention the kid quits when things are hard, and this time they intervened. The kid was trying to get help from his mom but was told to solve it himself. The author's reasoning is to prevent the kid from giving up, but maybe they forced the kid too much?\n\nI need to consider child development. At 7 years old, persistence is a skill to build, but pushing too hard might lead to negative associations. The author's approach was to enforce finishing the level, but maybe it's better to teach problem-solving without forcing completion. Also, the kid might feel pressured, leading to frustration. However, the author's intention is to encourage perseverance, which is positive. But the method\u2014forcing the child to finish without support\u2014might be harsh. \n\nAnother angle: was there a more constructive way? Like helping the child find strategies instead of making him finish alone? Or setting a time limit for trying? The author says they aren't making games a chore, but their action could be seen as turning it into a chore. The line between teaching persistence and being overbearing is thin here. \n\nAlso, the stepson might need guidance rather than being forced. If the author had explained the trick or encouraged trying different approaches, maybe the lesson would be better. Forcing completion without support might not teach problem-solving effectively. The key is whether the method is appropriate for a 7-year-old. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The intention is good, but the execution might be problematic. The author is trying to prevent quitting, but the way they did it could be seen as authoritarian. The answer depends on balancing discipline with support. So, the author might be in the wrong because the approach could be too harsh without teaching the child how to solve the problem on his own.\n"
