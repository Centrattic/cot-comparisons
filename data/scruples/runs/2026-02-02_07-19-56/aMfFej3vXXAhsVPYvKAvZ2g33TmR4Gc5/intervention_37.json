He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson tends to give up when things get challenging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author wants to instill perseverance and problem-solving in the child. On the surface, pushing a child to overcome challenges can be seen as positive, encouraging persistence. But there's a line between teaching resilience and being too harsh.\n\nThe stepson is only 7 years old. At that age, kids have short attention spans and may not have developed the patience or problem-solving skills expected here. The father intervened when the child was stuck, which is a common parenting scenario. However, forcing a child to keep trying when they're clearly frustrated might backfire. It could lead to resentment or a fear of challenging tasks.\n\nThe father's intention is clear: to prevent the child from quitting. But the method used\u2014telling the child he \"needs to figure it out\" and cutting off arguments\u2014might come across as authoritarian. The child might feel pressured, which isn't ideal for learning. Maybe a better approach would be guiding the child to find the solution, offering help without taking over, and praising effort rather than just the outcome.\n\nAlso, the father mentions he's not trying to make video games a chore. Yet, by forcing the child to finish, he's turning it into a task rather than a fun activity. This might decrease the child's intrinsic motivation to play and learn. Positive reinforcement and collaborative problem-solving could be more effective.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, the key is whether the father's actions crossed the line. While teaching perseverance is good, the manner in which he did it could be seen as overly strict. The child might not understand why he has to finish, leading to confusion or frustration. The father might benefit from discussing with the child's mother to align on parenting strategies, especially since the child usually goes to the mother for help.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is noble, the approach could be problematic. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used might be too harsh for a young child and could hinder the learning experience rather than help it.\n"
