He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is the stepfather of a 7-year-old stepson. The kid has a habit of quitting when things get challenging. In this case, the stepson is playing a video game, specifically a retro Sonic game. The problem comes when he encounters a part where he needs to grab a power-up to blast through a wall. Instead of trying to figure it out, he just runs into the wall for 5 minutes and then goes to get his mom. The author steps in and tells him he has to finish the level because he's tired of the kid quitting. The kid argues, but eventually finishes. The author says he's not making games a chore but doesn't want to raise someone who doesn't put in effort.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, the kid is only 7. At that age, children often struggle with persistence and problem-solving. They might not have developed the patience or strategies to figure things out on their own. The stepson's behavior of giving up and going to get his mom is common for that age, especially if he's used to getting help quickly. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach is questionable.\n\nForcing a child to finish a video game level might not be the best way to teach persistence. It could lead to resentment or stress. The author says he's not making games a chore, but by forcing the child to complete the level, he's turning it into a chore. The kid might associate the game with negative feelings, which could reduce his motivation in the future.\n\nAlso, the child's age is a factor. At 7, kids are still learning how to handle frustration and problem-solving. The parent's role is to guide and support, not to force them into situations that might overwhelm them. The stepson might need encouragement, hints, or a different approach rather than being forced to finish. The parent could have helped him figure out the trick instead of making him redo it.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to teach perseverance, which is a good lesson. However, the method might be too harsh for a young child. The child was already trying but in the wrong way. The parent could have stepped in with guidance instead of insisting on completion without assistance. The key is balance\u2014encouraging problem-solving while providing support when needed.\n\nAnother point is that the parent was studying while the kid played, so maybe the parent didn't have time to help. But in this case, the parent decided to intervene and make the kid finish. Maybe the parent could have explained the problem and helped the child find the solution instead of forcing him to do it alone.\n\nIn summary, the parent's intention is good, but the method of forcing the child to complete the level without help might be too strict for a 7-year-old. The child needs guidance and encouragement rather than being made to finish on his own without any support. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not using a more supportive approach.\n"
