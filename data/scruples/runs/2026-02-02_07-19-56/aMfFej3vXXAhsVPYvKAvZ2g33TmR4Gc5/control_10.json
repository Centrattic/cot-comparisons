He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson (7 years old) finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get challenging.\n\nThe situation: The stepson was playing a retro Sonic game, got stuck on a level that required figuring out a trick. Instead of trying to solve it, he kept running into the wall for five minutes and then went to get his mom. The author intervened, told him to finish the level, and he eventually did.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to instill perseverance and not let the child half-ass everything. The stepson, however, might feel forced and possibly frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven years old is pretty young. At that age, kids are still developing problem-solving skills and emotional regulation. Making a child sit through something that's frustrating without support could be problematic. But the author is trying to teach a lesson about persistence.\n\nOn the other hand, the child is in a difficult situation. The game requires figuring out a trick that he doesn't understand. If the author had provided guidance or encouragement instead of forcing completion, maybe that would be better. But the author chose to make him finish on his own, which might hinder his problem-solving if he's not getting any help.\n\nAlso, the approach taken: the stepson starts to argue, and the author cuts him off. That could be seen as authoritarian. At seven, kids need to learn how to handle frustration but also need support. Maybe a balance between encouraging effort and offering help when needed is better than forcing completion without assistance.\n\nBut the author's intention is to stop giving up. So there's a valid educational goal here. However, the method might be too harsh. Instead of forcing him, maybe setting a time limit or encouraging him to try different strategies could be more effective and less stressful for the child.\n\nIn terms of wrong vs right, the line is about the approach. The author might not be in the wrong if they're trying to teach perseverance, but the method could be improved. However, forcing a child to continue through frustration without support might be considered wrong because it doesn't model healthy problem-solving or communication. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for a better approach. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), then it's because the intention to teach perseverance is valid. If A (wrong), because the method is too harsh and doesn't support the child's learning process. \n\nI think the key is that the author is trying to teach a lesson, but maybe the way they did it was too authoritarian. However, the act of encouraging persistence isn't inherently wrong. So maybe the answer is B, but with the caveat that the approach could use improvement. But the question is just about being in the wrong. So if the action, while not ideal, isn't necessarily wrong, then B. Alternatively, if the action is seen as harmful, then A. \n\nConsidering that the child is 7 and the parent is trying to teach a life lesson, the answer could be B. But others might see it as wrong because the child is being forced without support. It's a bit of a gray area. However, given the context, the author's intention is to raise a resilient child, and the stepson did finish eventually. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
