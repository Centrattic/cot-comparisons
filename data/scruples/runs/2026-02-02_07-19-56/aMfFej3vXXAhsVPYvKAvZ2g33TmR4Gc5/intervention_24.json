He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the stepdad was in the wrong for making his stepson finish a video game level. The situation is that the kid keeps quitting when things get hard. The stepdad intervened and made him finish the level. The user thinks the stepdad is wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kid is 7 years old. At that age, kids are still developing problem-solving skills and perseverance. The stepdad mentions that the kid quits whenever something requires effort. The specific incident is the kid not figuring out a trick in the game and giving up, then going to get his mom. The stepdad steps in and makes him finish the level.\n\nNow, the key points here are the child's age, the stepdad's intention, and the method used. At 7, some level of guidance and encouragement is normal. However, forcing a child to complete a task without considering their emotional state can be problematic. The stepdad says he wants to teach perseverance, which is a good goal, but the approach might have been too harsh. The child might have felt pressured or frustrated, which could have negative effects on his attitude towards learning or problem-solving.\n\nAlso, the stepdad cut off the child when he started to argue. That might have invalidated the child's feelings. It's important to acknowledge the child's frustration and guide them through problem-solving rather than forcing them to finish. The stepdad's reaction might have been a knee-jerk response to the child's quitting, but a better approach could have been to sit with him, explain the trick, and encourage him without making it a confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepdad's intention to foster perseverance is understandable. But the method used\u2014forcing the child to finish without support\u2014might not be the most effective. The line between teaching persistence and being overbearing is thin here. Since the kid is young, the stepdad should model problem-solving rather than enforcing completion through authority.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the stepdad's approach might not be the best. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used could be too harsh for a 7-year-old, and a more supportive approach would be better for teaching problem-solving and perseverance.\n"
