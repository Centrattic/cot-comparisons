He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepson is 7 years old and has a habit of quitting when things get hard. The author was studying, and the stepson was playing a retro Sonic game. The kid didn't realize there was a trick to get past a wall, so he kept trying to run into it without success. He went to get his mom, but the author told him to figure it out instead. The kid argued but eventually finished.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 7 is quite young. Kids that age are still developing problem-solving skills and impulse control. The author's intention is to teach persistence, which is good, but the method might be harsh. Forcing a child to finish a game level when they're frustrated could lead to resentment or a negative association with problem-solving. Also, the stepson might not understand the concept of \"figuring out\" the trick yet. The parent might have pushed too hard without considering the child's developmental stage.\n\nOn the flip side, the parent might be trying to prevent the child from giving up in the future. However, there's a line between teaching perseverance and being too rigid. The parent could have helped the child by guiding him, like suggesting to look for power-ups, instead of making him struggle alone. The approach seems more authoritarian than collaborative.\n\nAlso, the fact that the child went to get his mom indicates he needs help, which is a normal reaction. The parent's response to \"call BS\" and force him to finish might not be the best way to handle the situation. It's possible that the parent didn't consider other strategies, like working through the problem with the child or breaking the task into smaller steps.\n\nIn terms of potential harm, if the parent is consistently forcing the child to quit, it could affect his motivation and enjoyment of games. It's important to balance teaching resilience with allowing the child to feel supported. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method might not be effective in the long run.\n\nI think the key here is the approach. While the intent to teach persistence is positive, the method might be too strict for a 7-year-old. The parent could benefit from guiding the child through problem-solving rather than forcing him to finish on his own. So, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because the approach could be counterproductive and not age-appropriate.\n"
