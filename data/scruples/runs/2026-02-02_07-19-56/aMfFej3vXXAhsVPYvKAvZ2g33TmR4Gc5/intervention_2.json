He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for making their 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter\" who gives up when things get challenging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 7, kids are still developing their problem-solving skills and resilience. The stepson is playing a game that's supposed to be fun. If he's stuck on a part that requires a specific trick, maybe he's not yet able to figure it out on his own. The parent intervened and made him finish the level after he tried to quit, arguing that it's important to not give up.\n\nBut is forcing a child to finish a difficult level appropriate? On one hand, teaching perseverance is good, but on the other hand, the method used\u2014refusing to let him quit and making him argue\u2014might be harsh. The child might not have the cognitive ability or patience to work through it without help. Also, video games for a child should be a source of enjoyment, not a chore. The parent mentions they don't want games to be a chore, but their action here might be turning it into one.\n\nThe parent's intention is to prevent the child from giving up on things. However, the approach could be counterproductive. If the child feels forced, he might develop a negative association with the game or problem-solving in general. Maybe the parent could have offered a different strategy, like guiding the child through the problem instead of forcing him to figure it out alone.\n\nAlso, the stepson is a stepchild, so the parent's authority and relationship might be different. It's possible that the stepmom is the one who usually helps, so when the parent says \"no\" and makes him finish without her, it could be frustrating for the child. The parent might not be the primary caregiver, which could affect how the child perceives the situation.\n\nAnother angle: the parent was studying and allowed the child to play. The parent's reaction might be out of frustration from seeing the child struggle for a long time without success. But the child's effort was just trying the same approach repeatedly for 5 minutes, which isn't really problem-solving. Maybe the parent is right in pushing the child to find a solution, but the way it's done is the issue.\n\nIn AITA posts, the common themes are about fairness, methods used, and considering the child's perspective. The parent's method of cutting off the child's argument and forcing completion might be seen as too strict. The parent's intention is good, but the execution could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the approach wasn't supportive enough and could harm the child's enjoyment, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if fostering perseverance is justified even if the method is strict. Hmm.\n"
