He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson usually quits when things get tough, so the author intervened this time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was studying while the stepson played. The stepson gives up when the game requires effort, running into a wall without trying the solution. The author told him to finish the level, leading to an argument, but eventually, the stepson completed it. The author's goal is to prevent the child from quitting and to encourage persistence.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The stepson is only 7 years old. At that age, kids have short attention spans and might not understand the need to persist through challenges. The author's approach was to enforce finishing the level, which could be seen as pushing the child to problem-solve, which is a good life skill. However, the method might be harsh. Forcing a child to continue without giving them other options or support could be stressful. The author mentions not wanting video games to be chores, but making him finish might contradict that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to teach perseverance. But the stepson is a child, and the parent's role is to guide gently, not force. There might be a better approach, like offering hints or encouragement rather than insisting on completion. Also, the child going to his mom for help suggests he's seeking support, so cutting him off might not be the best strategy.\n\nConsidering child development, 7-year-olds are still learning how to handle frustration. The author's reaction is in line with teaching persistence, but the method might be too strict. It's a balance between encouraging effort and not being overbearing. The author's intention is positive, but the execution could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because forcing a young child without considering their emotional state or offering alternative support could be harmful. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if seen as a necessary teaching moment. But since the child is young and the approach was strict, A might be the right choice.\n"
