He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old and tends to quit when things get challenging. The parent was studying while the kid played. When the kid ran into a tricky part and tried to ask for help, the parent said no and made him figure it out. The kid argued but eventually finished.\n\nHmm, so the parent's intention is to stop the kid from quitting whenever things get hard. They don't want to make games a chore, but also want to teach perseverance. The key points here are the parent's approach and the child's age. \n\nAt 7 years old, kids are developing problem-solving skills and learning resilience. However, forcing them might not be the best approach. It's important to encourage critical thinking without making them feel punished. The parent did step in when the kid tried to quit, which is good, but the method\u2014telling the kid to come back and finish without help\u2014could be a bit harsh. \n\nIs forcing the child to figure it out on their own the right way? Maybe there's a balance between encouraging independence and offering support. The parent might have wanted to teach a lesson, but the child might have felt frustrated or pressured. It's possible the parent could have guided the child instead of just making them stick with it without any assistance. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions the child \"half-asses everything,\" which suggests a pattern the parent is trying to correct. But in this specific instance, the solution was to force completion. The child did eventually finish, but the process might have been stressful. \n\nI think the parent's intention is good\u2014to foster perseverance. However, the approach could be improved by offering encouragement or hints instead of forcing the child to struggle alone. The parent might be in the right in wanting to teach perseverance, but the method could be in the wrong if it's too authoritarian. So, maybe the answer is A, the parent is in the wrong because the approach might be too harsh for a 7-year-old, even if the intention is good.\n"
