He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepdad who made his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The kid tends to quit when things get tough, and this time, he didn't realize the trick in the game and kept running into a wall. The dad said he was done and made him finish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Seven is a young age where kids are still learning perseverance and problem-solving. The dad's intention was to teach the kid not to give up, which is a valid parenting goal. But is forcing a child to finish a game level appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the dad is trying to instill resilience. Not letting the child give up might help him develop persistence. However, at 7, children also need to learn that it's okay to ask for help. The kid went to get his mom, which is a natural response. The dad's reaction was to stop him and make him finish, which could be seen as dismissing the child's need for support.\n\nAlso, the method of \"forcing\" might be counterproductive. If the child feels pressured to finish just to please the parent, he might lose interest in the game or develop a negative association with trying new things. It's a balance between encouraging effort and respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the dad's approach. He cut off the argument and made the kid finish. Was that too authoritarian? Maybe there's a better way, like guiding the child to figure it out without forcing him. The key question is whether the dad's actions were constructive or punitive.\n\nThe dad mentions he's not trying to make games a chore, but the way he handled it might have turned it into one. Children need guidance, but also the freedom to walk away when appropriate. Pushing too hard without considering the child's feelings could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn summary, while the dad's intention is good, the method might be too harsh for a 7-year-old. It's possible he's in the wrong for not allowing the child to seek help and for using force instead of a more supportive approach.\n"
