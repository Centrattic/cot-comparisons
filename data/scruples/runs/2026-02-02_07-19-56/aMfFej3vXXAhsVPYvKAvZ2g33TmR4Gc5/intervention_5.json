He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a stepfather who made his 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level after the kid kept quitting. The author is asking if they're the AITA (Asshole of the Day). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the stepson is described as a \"constant quitter.\" He gives up when things get challenging. In this case, he was playing a retro Sonic game. When he hit a wall that required a trick (grabbing a power-up to blast through), he didn't figure it out and went to get his mom. The stepfather intervened, told him to come back and finish the level, and the kid argued but eventually did it. The author's reasoning is to prevent the child from half-assing everything.\n\nNow, considering the child's age (7 years old), the approach here might be too harsh. At that age, kids are learning problem-solving and persistence, but they also need guidance and encouragement. Forcing a young child to finish a difficult part without providing support or teaching them how to figure it out could be counterproductive. The stepfather might have wanted to teach perseverance, but the method used\u2014cutting off the child mid-argument and forcing him to finish\u2014could be seen as authoritarian. It might not be fostering intrinsic motivation but rather compliance out of fear or frustration.\n\nAlso, the stepfather's comment about being tired of watching the child quit suggests a lack of patience. While it's important to encourage effort, the way the stepfather handled it could damage the child's confidence or create a negative association with challenges. Instead of forcing the child to finish, maybe guiding him through the problem step by step would be more effective in teaching problem-solving skills.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepfather has a valid concern about the child quitting. However, the approach taken might not be the best way to address the issue. The key here is the method of enforcement versus a supportive teaching approach. The child might have benefited more from encouragement and hints rather than being forced to finish. So, while the intent was to teach persistence, the execution could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
