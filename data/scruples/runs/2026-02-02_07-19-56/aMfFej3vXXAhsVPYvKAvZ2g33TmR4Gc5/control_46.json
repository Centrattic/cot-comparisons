He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for making their 7-year-old stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is described as a \"constant quitter,\" and the author intervened when the kid was stuck on a part of the game. The kid tried the same thing for 5 minutes without figuring it out and then went to get his mom. The author told him to come back and finish it, leading to an argument but the kid eventually completing the level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages involved. The stepson is only 7 years old. At that age, kids have short attention spans and are still developing problem-solving skills. The author's intention is to teach perseverance, which is a good life skill. However, the method might be too harsh for a child that young. Forcing a 7-year-old to sit through a frustrating situation without giving them breaks or guiding them through the problem might be counterproductive. It could lead to stress or resentment instead of learning persistence.\n\nAlso, the fact that the stepson was playing a game the author got him for Christmas suggests that the game might be meant for leisure. Making him finish a level might take away the enjoyment, which is supposed to be a reward. But the author's point is about quitting when things get hard, so they see it as teaching a lesson.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's approach. Instead of forcing the completion, maybe a different method could be better, like helping the child figure it out, encouraging trial and error, or breaking the problem into smaller steps. Using the opportunity to teach problem-solving rather than persistence through force.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is valid in teaching perseverance. However, the balance between pushing for effort and respecting the child's emotional needs is crucial. The child might feel pressured, especially since it's a step-parent relationship, which can sometimes be more complex.\n\nIn terms of age-appropriateness, a 7-year-old might not have the cognitive maturity to handle frustration in that way. The author might be overestimating the child's ability to handle the situation independently. The key here is whether the approach is suitable for a young child. Forcing completion without guidance could reinforce negative feelings towards the activity rather than fostering perseverance.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the method used might be too harsh for a 7-year-old, and alternative strategies could be more effective and less stressful for the child.\n"
