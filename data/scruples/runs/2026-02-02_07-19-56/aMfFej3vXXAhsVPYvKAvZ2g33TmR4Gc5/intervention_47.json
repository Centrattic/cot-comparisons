He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepson who's a \"constant quitter\" and the parent forcing him to finish a game level. \n\nFirst, the parent is trying to teach persistence. They mention the stepson gives up when something gets challenging. The parent intervened when the stepson went to get his mom, making him figure out the trick to beat the level. The parent's intention is to prevent the child from developing a habit of quitting.\n\nBut wait, is forcing a child to finish a game level appropriate? The parent says it's not about making games a chore, but about not raising someone who half-asses everything. However, using authority to force a child to continue something they're struggling with might not be the best approach. It could lead to frustration or resentment. Maybe there's a better way to encourage problem-solving without coercion.\n\nAlso, the child is 7 years old. At that age, kids often need guidance and encouragement rather than being forced. The parent could have helped the child figure out the trick together instead of making him finish it alone. The parent's method might come across as authoritarian rather than supportive. \n\nThe key point is the parent's approach. Instead of forcing, maybe offering help or positive reinforcement would be more effective. The parent's intention is good, but the method might be counterproductive. So, while the goal is to build resilience, the method could be in the wrong.\n"
