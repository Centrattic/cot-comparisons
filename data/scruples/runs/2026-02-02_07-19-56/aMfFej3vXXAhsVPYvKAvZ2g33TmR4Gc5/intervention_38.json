He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old, and the author is trying to teach him perseverance because he gives up easily. The situation was that the kid was playing a game and kept trying the same thing without success, then went to get his mom. The author stepped in and made him finish the level.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the age. Seven-year-olds are still developing their problem-solving skills and self-regulation. The author is trying to encourage persistence, which is a good trait. But forcing a child to keep playing a game when he's frustrated might not be the best approach. It could lead to resentment or a negative association with the activity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't making the kid play out of obligation but to teach a life lesson. The key here is the method. Was the author being supportive or just authoritarian? If the author helped the child figure out the trick instead of just making him try again, that might have been better. But in this case, the author told him to come back and finish, which led to an argument. \n\nAlso, the child is a stepson, so there might be different dynamics. The author might be trying to establish some authority, but it's important to balance discipline with empathy. Young kids need guidance and encouragement. Forcing him without providing support might not be effective in the long run. It's possible that the author's intent is good, but the method could be improved. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether the approach is appropriate. The answer could be either way. If the author was using this as a teachable moment but in a way that's overly strict, maybe A. But if it's about setting boundaries and teaching responsibility, maybe B. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the intention is to build resilience, but maybe there's a better way. However, the line between teaching and being too harsh can be thin. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to consider that perspective as well. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the intent is positive and the child is learning perseverance, even if the method could be refined. But I'm a bit conflicted because the approach might not be the most constructive. But given the options, B seems more appropriate.\n"
