He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their stepson finish a video game level. The stepson is 7 years old, and the author mentions he's a constant quitter when things get challenging. The situation is that the stepson was playing a retro Sonic game and kept hitting a wall without trying to find the solution. The author told him to figure it out instead of giving up and asking his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 7, kids are still learning persistence and problem-solving. The author's goal is to teach him not to quit when faced with a challenge. But the method used here is \"forcing\" him to finish the level. The word \"forcing\" might imply a lack of negotiation or understanding. Maybe the author should have guided him instead of just making him do it without explanation. \n\nChildren can get frustrated easily, especially when they don't understand why they have to keep trying. The stepson might have felt pressured or punished, which could make him associate the activity with negative feelings. The author mentions they're not trying to make games a chore, but forcing him to finish the level might do the opposite if the child feels it's being imposed. \n\nAlso, using the phrase \"half ass everything\" could come off as harsh. It's important how we phrase our expectations to kids. Maybe a more encouraging approach, like helping him find the power-up or praising his effort when he tries, would be better. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to instill a valuable life lesson in perseverance. There's a balance between teaching persistence and respecting the child's emotional state. If the child was in the middle of a game he was voluntarily playing, making him finish it might not be wrong, but the way it was handled could be. \n\nSo, the key points are: the method of forcing, the communication style, and the age-appropriateness of the lesson. If the author used a more supportive approach, maybe the outcome would be better. But the intent is good as they don't want the child to give up easily. However, the approach might have been too rigid, leading to potential harm in the child's motivation or attitude towards games. \n\nI think the answer is A (in the wrong) because forcing a child to continue without allowing them to take a break or providing guidance might be too harsh and not consider the child's perspective. Teaching persistence should be done in a way that's encouraging, not by cutting off his attempts to ask for help and making him finish without support.\n"
