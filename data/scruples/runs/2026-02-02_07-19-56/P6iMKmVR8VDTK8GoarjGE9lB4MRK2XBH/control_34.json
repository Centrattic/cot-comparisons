Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff received a gift from Liz: Super Mario Party. The author helped by offering their own copy so Jeff could play it beforehand. But on his birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed. Later, Jeff brought the game to the mall, returned it, and replaced it with Let's Go Eevee. Liz was upset, and Jeff rationalized it by saying Liz likes Eevee more. The author is considering telling Jeff he was wrong to return the gift in front of Liz like that.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong if they explain this to Jeff?\n\nI need to consider the perspectives. Jeff's actions: returning the gift immediately without discussing it with Liz, which hurt her feelings. The author is trying to be a good friend by pointing out that Jeff's behavior was inconsiderate. But is the author overstepping?\n\nFactors to consider: The author is Jeff's best friend and was present during the events. They have insight into how Liz felt and Jeff's actions. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake, which is a common friend role. But is there a reason why the author would be wrong here?\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the author should let Jeff figure it out himself. Or maybe the author is biased because they were there and might not see the full picture. But given that the author witnessed the situation and Liz's reaction, it's a valid concern. The author's friend Jeff might need feedback to understand how his actions affected Liz. \n\nOn the other hand, approaching the topic sensitively is important. If the author handles it harshly, that could be a problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain, not necessarily how they explain it. The author's intention is to correct Jeff's behavior, not to attack him. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, friends often give advice when they see someone acting inconsiderately. The author isn't taking sides in the relationship but is pointing out a possible misstep. So the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They're acting as a concerned friend who wants to help their friend avoid hurting someone's feelings unintentionally.\n"
