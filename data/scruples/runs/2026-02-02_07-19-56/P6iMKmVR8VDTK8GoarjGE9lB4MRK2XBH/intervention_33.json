Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to Jeff that his handling of Liz's gift was poor. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff received a gift from Liz, which was Super Mario Party. He didn't like it and immediately returned it for something else, Let's Go Eevee. The author drove 250 miles to visit Jeff on his birthday, and they had planned to play the game. Jeff changed the plans, then later returned the gift in front of Liz, who was upset.\n\nThe author's friend Jeff might have acted inconsiderately by returning the gift without considering Liz's feelings. The author wants to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful. Now, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's true.\n\nThe author's intention is to point out Jeff's mistake. But maybe the author didn't realize their own role in the situation. The user says the author is in the wrong. Let me check the details again.\n\nThe author had a copy of Mario Party and let Jeff use it before the birthday. Then, during the birthday, Jeff changed the plan to play Smash instead. The author didn't argue and went along. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and returned it. The author is considering talking to Jeff about this.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to address this? Well, sometimes friends do correct each other if they think a mistake was made. The key is the approach. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to help a friend avoid hurting someone's feelings. However, maybe the author's initial action of letting Liz know the game was available could have influenced Jeff's expectations. If the author thought Jeff would prefer Mario Party, maybe that's where the problem started. But the main issue is Jeff's reaction, not the author's role in suggesting the game. \n\nThe author's main action is wanting to explain Jeff's behavior, which is a common friend intervening to help. So, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe the author did contribute by letting Liz know the game was available, leading Jeff to expect it. However, the main fault is Jeff's reaction, not the author's suggestion. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to explain the situation to Jeff. So answer B.\n"
