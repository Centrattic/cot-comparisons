Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person considering advising Jeff) is in the wrong if they explain to Jeff how he handled the birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his 20th birthday. The author had a copy and suggested using it. On the day, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Later, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed. Then, he returned the game for another one, making Liz upset. The author is now considering telling Jeff this was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: Did Jeff act inconsiderately towards Liz? Yes, by returning her gift immediately and in front of her. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom the story, the author is Jeff's friend and is trying to help him see the error in his actions. The author isn't making a public accusation but is offering private feedback. Liz is the one who got upset, and Jeff's actions hurt her feelings. The author's intervention is to explain the hurt caused, which is a common way friends support each other. The alternative would be silence, allowing the mistake to continue.\n\nBut could the author be wrong? If the advice is given in a respectful way and the author has good intentions, then likely not. The problem was Jeff's actions, not the author's intention to explain them. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
