Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author helped by letting Jeff use their copy so he could get familiar with the game. On Jeff's birthday, he didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. When Liz gave him the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for Let's Go Eevee, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff that returning the gift in front of Liz was rude. The question is if the author is the asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff's reaction to the gift, the public return of the gift in front of Liz, and the author's intention to confront Jeff about it. \n\nIn relationships, how someone handles a gift, especially from a partner, can be sensitive. Jeff's immediate return of the gift without considering Liz's feelings seems thoughtless. The author wants to point out that Jeff's actions could hurt Liz, which is an attempt to help Jeff realize his mistake. \n\nThe author's motivation here is likely to support Liz and help Jeff understand the impact of his actions. Since the author is a friend, giving honest feedback is usually appropriate, especially if it helps Jeff avoid hurting Liz further. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's approach is confrontational or if they're not respecting Jeff's autonomy, it could be problematic. But the scenario doesn't indicate that. The author wants to explain, not scold, to help Jeff see things from Liz's perspective. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to provide this feedback. The main issue is Jeff's behavior, not the author's intention to address it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
