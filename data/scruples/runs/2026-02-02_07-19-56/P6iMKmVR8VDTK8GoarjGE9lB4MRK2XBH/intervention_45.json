Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" post) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that his handling of the birthday gift was poor.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, bought him Super Mario Party for his 20th birthday. The author, who's a close friend, had already offered to let Liz use their copy so Jeff could get familiar with the game. Then, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. After receiving the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, Let's Go Eevee. The author is considering confronting Jeff about this, which led to Liz being upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Was Jeff's reaction reasonable? Did the author have a right to intervene? The author's role is as a best friend, so their intention might be to help Jeff see his mistake. However, Jeff's actions could be seen as dismissive of Liz's effort to choose a gift he wanted. The author might think Jeff was inconsiderate, but is the author wrong for wanting to address it?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. If Jeff's actions hurt Liz and the author is trying to help Jeff realize that, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But if the author is overstepping by getting involved in a private matter, perhaps they are. The author is a friend, so it's their role to give honest feedback. However, the way they approach it matters. The question is whether the author's intention to confront Jeff makes them the asshole.\n\nIn most cases, friends do give advice, even if it's about a partner. Unless the author is being malicious, their intention is to help. Jeff's behavior was arguably inconsiderate, so pointing that out is not the author's fault. The author isn't the one who returned the gift; Jeff did. So the author is not in the wrong for wanting to explain the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
