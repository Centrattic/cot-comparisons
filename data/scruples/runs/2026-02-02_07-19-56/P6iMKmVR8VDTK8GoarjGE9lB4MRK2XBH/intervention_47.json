Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the situation is about Jeff's birthday, and the author is trying to figure out if explaining Jeff's poor handling of his girlfriend Liz's gift would make them the asshole. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that Liz asked if the Mario Party gift would be good, and the author had a copy already, so they offered to play it before the gift. Then on Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which hurt Liz's feelings.\n\nThe author is considering whether to tell Jeff that his actions were inconsiderate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong if they explain Jeff's mistake? Well, Jeff's actions were definitely hurtful to Liz. Returning a gift on the same day, especially when the girlfriend was already emotional, shows a lack of consideration. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake. \n\nBut is the author the asshole for stepping in? The key points are: Jeff's reaction to the gift, the way he returned it in front of Liz, and the fact that the author is a friend trying to help. \n\nThe author might have a valid point in pointing out Jeff's behavior. However, maybe the author should consider if Jeff is open to feedback. Also, the author's role as a friend might justify the intervention. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe Jeff's actions were his own responsibility, and the author overstepping if they interfere. But given how hurt Liz is, the author's concern is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's intention is genuinely to help, not to criticize. If the author approaches it supportively, they might not be the asshole. But if they're being judgmental, maybe. However, since Jeff's actions were clearly inconsiderate, the author's explanation is warranted. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
