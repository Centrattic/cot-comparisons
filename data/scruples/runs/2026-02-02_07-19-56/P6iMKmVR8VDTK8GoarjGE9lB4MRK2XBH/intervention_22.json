Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend that he handled his birthday gift poorly. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author if Mario Party was a good gift. The author had a copy and offered to use that so Jeff could be familiar with the game. Then on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party, chose Smash instead. After receiving the Mario Party as a gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed. Later, he took it to GameStop and traded it for another game, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were poor. The user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but the question is whether that's the case.\n\nHmm. Let's break down the key points. \n\n1. **Jeff's Reaction to the Gift**: Jeff was underwhelmed and didn't want to play the game his girlfriend chose. That's a problem because it's rude to show disappointment in a gift, especially in front of the giver. But the author is the one who told Jeff to use their own copy before the gift was given. So maybe that influenced Jeff's expectations?\n\nWait, the author offered to use their own copy so Jeff could be familiar. Maybe that led Jeff to expect the game, so when he got it as a gift, he was like \"Oh, I already played this, not what I wanted.\" But is that the author's fault? The author's intention was to help Jeff be familiar with the game before the gift. So Liz bought the game as a gift, but Jeff already played it because the author offered.\n\nThen, Jeff went to GameStop and returned the gift for another game, which upset Liz. The author wants to explain that Jeff's actions were wrong.\n\nBut wait, is the author responsible for Jeff's reaction? The author's advice might have contributed to Jeff's expectations. If Jeff thought he already knew the game and was underwhelmed by the gift, maybe the author's initial suggestion to use their own copy set up Jeff's reaction. But was the author in the wrong for that?\n\nAlso, when Jeff returned the gift immediately, that's a problem. Returning a gift given by a partner, especially in a way that makes the giver emotional, is definitely poor handling. The author is right to think Jeff was wrong there.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for explaining that to Jeff. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author is just trying to help a friend who acted poorly.\n\nWait, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But why? Maybe because the author's initial action of offering to use their copy led to the situation. But the author didn't tell Jeff to return the gift. The author is now trying to correct Jeff's behavior. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author overstepped by getting involved in the gift selection and then later advising Jeff to return it. Wait, no\u2014the author is trying to explain that Jeff's actions were wrong, not encouraging them. So if the author is just pointing out Jeff's mistake, is that the author being in the wrong?\n\nIn terms of social norms, advising a friend that they messed up isn't the author's fault. The problem is Jeff's behavior, not the author's for pointing it out. So the author isn't in the wrong for trying to explain that Jeff was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
