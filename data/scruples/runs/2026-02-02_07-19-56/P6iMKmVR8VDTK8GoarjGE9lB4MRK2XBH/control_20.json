Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author's friend.\n\nSo, Liz bought Jeff Super Mario Party for his birthday, and Jeff didn't like it. He ended up returning it right away to get another game. The author is considering if they should explain to Jeff that his actions were poor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author was there, witnessed the situation, and now feels that Jeff's behavior was inappropriate. The author's intention is to explain to Jeff why returning the gift immediately in front of Liz was wrong. \n\nJeff's actions: On his birthday, he received a gift he didn't want. Instead of being appreciative, he returned it right away, perhaps in front of Liz. That's not nice. The author is trying to point out that this was rude or inconsiderate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to address this? Well, the author is trying to help a friend by pointing out a mistake. But maybe the author is overstepping? Or maybe they aren't? \n\nLiz was upset, and Jeff's actions hurt her feelings. The author's friend is trying to help Jeff understand his behavior. But does the author have the right to say something? \n\nJeff might not have realized how his actions affected Liz. The author's intention is to explain that returning the gift immediately, especially in front of the giver, is unkind. This seems like a valid concern. \n\nIf someone's friend is acting in a way that's hurting others, it's generally okay to point it out, especially if you care about both people. The author's motivation is to help Jeff and Liz. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should consider Jeff's perspective. Maybe Jeff had valid reasons, or maybe he's just not used to receiving gifts. But in this case, returning an unopened gift for another one seems selfish. \n\nI think the author is in the right because they're trying to help a friend and a friend's partner avoid hurt feelings. They aren't the one who returned the gift; they're just pointing out the problem. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
