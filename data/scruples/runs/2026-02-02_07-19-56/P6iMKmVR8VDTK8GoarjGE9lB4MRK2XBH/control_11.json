Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author's friend.\n\nSo, the main points: Jeff received Super Mario Party as a birthday gift from Liz. The author had already played it with him before the gift because he had a copy. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party, chose Smash instead, and then later returned the game for another one. The author is considering explaining that Jeff's handling of the gift was poor, especially since Liz was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author would be in the wrong by speaking up. The key here is whether Jeff's actions were inappropriate. Jeff returned the unopened gift immediately, which might be hurtful to Liz. The author's intention is to explain that Jeff's behavior was wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole here if they do that. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn these types of situations, the key factors are intent and the impact on others. Jeff's actions could be seen as dismissive of Liz's effort and feelings. By returning the gift right away without considering her feelings, he might have been inconsiderate. The author, as a friend, might have a responsibility to point out this behavior if it's harmful to the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author needs to approach this carefully. If done in a supportive way, the author isn't being an asshole. They're trying to help Jeff understand the consequences of his actions. Jeff's actions were arguably the problem here, not the author wanting to explain that. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing Jeff's behavior, which had negative effects on Liz. The author's intention is to help, not to undermine Jeff or Liz.\n"
