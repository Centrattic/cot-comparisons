Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the one asking the WIBTA question) is in the wrong if they explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jeff got a Mario Party game from his girlfriend Liz. The author had a copy and even offered for Jeff to use it before. On his birthday, Jeff initially wasn't interested in playing Mario Party when asked, so they played Smash instead. Then, after receiving the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed and later returned it to get Let's Go Eevee, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff that his reaction was poor, especially since he returned the gift in front of Liz and made her upset. The key points here are whether Jeff's actions were inappropriate and if the author is justified in confronting him.\n\nJeff's actions: He returned the gift immediately, which might come off as dismissive. He also rationalized it by saying he knew Liz wanted Eevee more. But the problem is that he didn't consider Liz's feelings, and doing it in front of her made her upset. The author, as a friend, might feel the need to address this to prevent further issues.\n\nIs the author in the wrong to explain this? Well, Jeff's behavior was hurtful to Liz, and as a friend, the author's intention is to help Jeff realize that. Since Jeff is the one who acted poorly, the author isn't the asshole for trying to correct his behavior. The author isn't directly involved in the action, just pointing out the issue. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
