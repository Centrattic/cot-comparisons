Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves Jeff's reaction to the birthday gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author is asking if they would be the asshole for explaining to Jeff that his reaction was poor.\n\nFirst, let's recap the key points. Liz asked if the Mario Party game was a good gift, and the author had their own copy, so they offered to play it beforehand. On Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose to play Smash instead. Later, when Liz gave him the gift, he was underwhelmed and then immediately returned it for another game, which upset Liz. The author drove 250 miles to be there and is now considering telling Jeff his actions were wrong.\n\nThe author is in a position where they want to help a friend, but the question is whether they're the asshole for doing so. The problem here is that Jeff's actions\u2014returning the gift immediately and in front of Liz\u2014were hurtful to Liz. The author is stepping in to point out that Jeff's behavior was poor, which is an attempt to address the issue.\n\nNow, considering the possible perspectives. Jeff might think that his actions were justified because he didn't like the game and wanted something else. But by returning the gift in front of Liz, he's showing disrespect to her effort and feelings. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand that his reaction was hurtful, which is a form of friendship support.\n\nHowever, the author's role in the situation needs to be considered. The author wasn't directly involved in the gift exchange or the return. They observed the events and now want to intervene. The key question is whether the author overstepped by giving advice that might not be asked for.\n\nIn many cases, friends do step in when they see each other making mistakes, especially if it affects their relationships. The author's motivation seems to be positive, wanting to help Jeff improve his relationship with Liz. But if Jeff doesn't want to hear it, the author might be causing more tension. However, the original question is about the author being in the wrong for attempting to explain this.\n\nLooking at the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) format, the focus is on whether the person's actions would make them the asshole. In this case, the author is considering giving advice, not acting on it yet. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to explain Jeff's poor handling of the gift.\n\nThe factors here are the author's intention to help, the potential to improve Jeff's relationship, and the possible consequences of the advice. Since the author's action is to explain Jeff's wrongdoing, which is a form of intervention, and given that Jeff's actions were indeed hurtful, the author's intention is to help, not to belittle. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to point out Jeff's mistake. The key is that the author is acting as a concerned friend trying to mediate a friendship issue.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for trying to explain that Jeff handled the gift poorly.\n"
