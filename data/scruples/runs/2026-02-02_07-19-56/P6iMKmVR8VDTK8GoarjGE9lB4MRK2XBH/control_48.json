Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. So the question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering explaining to Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. The scenario involves Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, giving him Super Mario Party. The author had already played it with Jeff before the birthday. Then, on the actual day, Jeff wasn't interested in playing the game, chose a different game, and later was underwhelmed by the gift. Eventually, Jeff returned the gift for another one in front of Liz, who was upset.\n\nThe author wants to tell Jeff that his actions were hurtful. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. Jeff received a gift from Liz. He didn't like it and returned it immediately in front of her, which caused her emotional distress. The author is considering intervening to explain Jeff's mistake. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, returning a gift right in front of the giver, especially when they were already unsure if it was appropriate, seems harsh. Jeff didn't seem to consider Liz's feelings here. The author stepping in to point this out could be seen as trying to help Jeff realize his error, which is a good friend's action.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. If the author's approach is tactful and not judgmental, it's reasonable. However, if the author is being condescending or making it about themselves, that could be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for offering this advice.\n\nThe \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) format usually looks at intentions and outcomes. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake, which is positive. Jeff's actions were hurtful, so pointing out the problem isn't wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is trying to do the right thing by addressing Jeff's poor handling of the situation. The key is that the author isn't the one who caused the problem; Jeff did. The author's role is as a concerned friend trying to mediate or offer perspective.\n"
