Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (Jeff) is in the wrong for returning his girlfriend Liz's birthday gift so quickly and in front of her, then rationalizing it by saying he knew she liked Eevee.\n\nFirst, Liz gave him Super Mario Party after asking if it was a good gift. Jeff had already played it via the author's copy. On his birthday, instead of engaging with the gift, he was underwhelmed and then immediately went to return it to get Let's Go Eevee. That seems pretty hurtful. The fact that he did it in front of her, with her noticing and almost crying, adds to the emotional impact. Then he tried to justify it by saying he knew she liked Eevee, which might not excuse the action.\n\nThe author (the person asking WIBTA) wants to explain that Jeff's handling was poor. The question is if the author (the one considering speaking up) is the asshole for doing so. The options are A (author in wrong) or B (not in wrong).\n\nIn WIBTA questions, the key is whether the person questioning is the asshole. The author here is the one who is thinking about confronting Jeff. The original Jeff's actions were clearly problematic. The person asking is not the one returning the gift; they're the friend who wants to explain that Jeff's behavior was hurtful. Therefore, the author (the person considering speaking up) is not the one at fault. They're trying to help a friend see the error in his ways, especially after hurting Liz. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
