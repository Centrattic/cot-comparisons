Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for advising their friend Jeff to explain that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly. The situation involves Jeff returning Liz's gift immediately after receiving it, which clearly hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author drove 250 miles to Jeff's birthday party. Liz had asked the author's opinion about the gift, Super Mario Party, because the author already owned a copy. The author suggested using their own copy so Jeff could get familiar with the game. On the day, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and opted for Smash instead. Then, after Liz gave him the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which Liz was interested in, causing emotional distress.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful. Let's think about the dynamics here. The author was involved in the situation by influencing Jeff's experience with the game. By offering their own copy, maybe the author set up a scenario where Jeff had already played it, so receiving it as a gift wasn't as exciting. But was that the author's fault? Probably not, since Liz asked for their opinion, and they tried to help.\n\nThen, Jeff's reaction to the gift and returning it in front of Liz. The act of returning a gift immediately, especially when the giver is present, is generally seen as rude. The author is considering telling Jeff this. The user is asking if the author would be the asshole for doing so. The key is whether the author's advice is justified or if they should stay out of it.\n\nThe author's intention here is to help Jeff realize his mistake and perhaps mend his relationship with Liz. Since the author was present and their suggestion might have contributed to the situation, they might feel responsible. However, Jeff's actions were his own choice. The author isn't the one who hurt Liz; Jeff did. So, the author's attempt to explain the poor handling is likely a good thing, not in the wrong. They're pointing out the error to help their friend, not to take blame. \n\nAnother angle: was the author supposed to stop Jeff from returning the gift? Probably not. But advising Jeff on his behavior is a form of support. The user is asking if they'd be the asshole for explaining that Jeff messed up. The answer would be B (No) because the author isn't the one who caused the issue. Jeff's actions were inappropriate, and the author is trying to help him understand that.\n"
