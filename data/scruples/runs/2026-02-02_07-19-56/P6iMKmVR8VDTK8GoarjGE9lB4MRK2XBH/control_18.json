Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who returned a birthday gift he received from his girlfriend, and the author wants to explain that the friend handled it poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to look at Jeff's actions. He got a gift from Liz, which he then returned right away in front of her. That seems pretty hurtful. Gifts are supposed to be about thoughtfulness, not just the item itself. By returning it immediately, Jeff might have made Liz feel like her choice wasn't appreciated. Especially since she had asked if the game was a good gift before buying it. So maybe Jeff wasn't fair to her there.\n\nThen, the author wants to explain to Jeff that returning the gift in front of Liz was wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole for doing that. The author is a friend and is trying to help Jeff see how his actions could have hurt Liz. Intervening in a friend's relationship can be tricky, but if the author is genuinely concerned about Jeff's behavior, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider if they're overstepping. But given that Jeff's actions were hurtful, the author might be right to address it. The key is whether the explanation is done in a constructive way. The author mentions that Liz was holding back tears, so Jeff's behavior had emotional consequences. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand, not to take sides necessarily. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong here. They're trying to help a friend who acted poorly, which isn't their fault. The answer should be B.\n"
