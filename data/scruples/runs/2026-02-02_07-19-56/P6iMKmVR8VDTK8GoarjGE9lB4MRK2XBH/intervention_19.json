Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation. Jeff received a gift from Liz, which was Super Mario Party. The author helped by offering their own copy so Jeff could play it beforehand. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned the game to exchange it for another one, which upset Liz. The author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But why? Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Jeff's actions\u2014returning the gift right in front of Liz\u2014could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. He might not have considered Liz's feelings when she put effort into choosing the gift. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake and maybe reconcile with Liz. Friends often give feedback when they see someone acting inconsiderately, especially if it affects a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping. Jeff could feel that the author is judging him, even though the intention is good. The author's role as a friend is to support Jeff, but they might not be the best person to address this unless Jeff is open to feedback. However, since Liz is upset, the author might be trying to prevent further conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author's approach is to explain calmly and with care, not to attack Jeff, then it's a well-meaning intervention. The key is the approach. If the author is being confrontational, it could be a problem. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain. The act of giving feedback, especially to protect a friend's relationship, is generally seen as helping, not being an asshole. Unless the author is doing it in a hurtful way, which isn't indicated here, they're not the asshole. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
