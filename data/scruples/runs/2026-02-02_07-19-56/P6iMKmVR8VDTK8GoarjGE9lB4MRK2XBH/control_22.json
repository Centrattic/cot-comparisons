Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario) would be in the wrong if they explained to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. The situation involves Jeff receiving a gift from his girlfriend Liz, a copy of Super Mario Party, which he then returns for another game, Let's Go Eevee, in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. Jeff's actions: he was underwhelmed by the gift, returned it immediately in front of Liz, and tried to justify it by saying he knew Liz liked Eevee. The author wants to explain that Jeff messed up by doing this, which could mean pointing out that he was dismissive of Liz's effort and hurt her feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for intervening. The possible angles to consider are:\n\n1. **Intent vs. Impact**: Jeff might have thought he was doing something nice by getting a game they both could enjoy, but his approach was hurtful. The author's intention is to help Jeff see the impact of his actions on Liz, which is well-meaning.\n\n2. **Friendship Dynamics**: As a best friend, the author might feel responsible to correct Jeff's behavior. However, it's important to consider how Jeff would receive such feedback and whether it's constructive or just criticism.\n\n3. **Respecting Relationships**: The author is trying to protect Liz's feelings, which is a positive intent. However, the author isn't the one who did the action; Jeff is. So the author's role here is as a mediator or advisor.\n\n4. **Overstepping?**: Could the author be overstepping by getting involved in Jeff and Liz's relationship? If Jeff didn't ask for advice, the author might be intruding. But given that Jeff is a friend, offering advice could be seen as helping.\n\n5. **Tone and Approach**: The author's method of explaining matters. If they approach it in a supportive way, it's less likely to be seen as the author being wrong. If it's confrontational, then maybe.\n\nNow, looking at the scenario from the author's perspective: they were present during the incident, saw Liz's reaction, and heard Jeff's justification. The author likely wants to help Jeff understand that his actions were hurtful and that returning a gift immediately can be seen as rejecting the thought behind it. The key here is whether the author's intervention is appropriate.\n\nIn many cases, friends do step in when they see a friend acting in a way that could harm a relationship. The author isn't taking sides but pointing out the potential harm. So unless the author is being rude or disrespectful in their explanation, their intent is to help. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the intent is to correct a friend's behavior that hurt someone else, which is a common and valid reason for friends to step in.\n"
