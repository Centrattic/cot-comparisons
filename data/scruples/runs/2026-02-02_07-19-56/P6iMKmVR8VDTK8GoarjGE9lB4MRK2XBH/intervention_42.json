Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Jeff's birthday and how he handled the gift from his girlfriend Liz. The author is asking if they would be the asshole (WIBTA) for explaining to Jeff that he handled the gift poorly.\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The author drove 250 miles to visit Jeff. Liz, Jeff's girlfriend, asked the author if Super Mario Party would be a good gift because the author already had a copy. The author let Jeff play it before the gift was given. On the birthday, Jeff wanted to play Smash Ultimate instead of Mario Party, which the author's group did, even though they had planned Mario Party. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, Let's Go Eevee, in front of Liz, making her upset.\n\nThe author is considering explaining to Jeff that his actions were hurtful. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about Jeff's behavior. He returned a gift immediately in front of his girlfriend, which she had clearly put thought into. The author is stepping in to address Jeff's poor handling of the situation. Now, is the author in the wrong for trying to explain that Jeff messed up?\n\nWell, the author is a friend, and sometimes friends need to call out bad behavior. If Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, the author might have a duty to point out that Jeff's actions were wrong. However, the author might be overstepping if they're not sure about their role in the situation. But given that the author was present and involved in the events (they were there for the birthday, played games, etc.), they have a legitimate perspective.\n\nJeff's actions seem inconsiderate. He dismissed Liz's gift, which she had asked about beforehand. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake, which could be seen as a good friend trying to help. However, the method of confronting Jeff might be important. If the author approaches it without being confrontational and with genuine concern, it's probably justified. But if they're being judgmental, that's different.\n\nSo, considering that the author is trying to help a friend avoid hurting his girlfriend further, and given Jeff's actions were clearly hurtful, the author's intervention is likely justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
