Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves Jeff's birthday and how he handled the gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author is considering whether to explain to Jeff that his actions were poor.\n\nFirst, let's recap the key points. Liz asked if the gift (Super Mario Party) would be good. The author had their own copy, so they offered to let Jeff play it before the birthday. Then, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which upset Liz. The author is thinking about telling Jeff he handled the gift poorly.\n\nNow, the question is: is the author in the wrong for wanting to explain this to Jeff? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider whether the author's intention is appropriate. The author's friend, Jeff, did something that hurt his girlfriend. The author might feel compelled to intervene because they witnessed the situation and see that Liz is upset. But is it the author's place to say something?\n\nJeff's actions were pretty hurtful. He returned an unopened gift that his girlfriend put thought into, right in front of her. That's not cool. The author might think Jeff was wrong and wants to help him realize that. But does that make the author the asshole for trying to explain it?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to be a good friend by pointing out Jeff's mistake. Friends often correct each other's behavior, especially when it affects others. On the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping, especially if Jeff didn't ask for advice. The situation could be a private matter between Jeff and Liz, and the author isn't in the relationship.\n\nBut the author was present during the events, saw how Liz was upset, and knows what happened. They might feel responsible because they helped Jeff play the game beforehand, which could lead to Jeff expecting it to be his favorite. However, the author's main role was facilitating the game play, not pressuring Jeff to like the gift.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't ask Liz if she wanted to talk, but instead is considering talking to Jeff. That could be a good approach, as it addresses Jeff's behavior directly. However, maybe the author should have let Liz handle it herself, as it's her relationship. But if Jeff's actions are hurting her, and the author witnessed it, maybe stepping in is justified.\n\nIs the author's intention to help Jeff understand his mistake, or to criticize him? If it's the former, then it's a good intention. The problem might be in how the author approaches it. If the author is confrontational, that could be an issue. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA format (Would I Be The Asshole?), the author is seeking validation if their action (explaining to Jeff) is appropriate. The original question is from the author's perspective, wondering if they would be the asshole for doing that. The answer here is whether the author is wrong for wanting to explain.\n\nGiven that Jeff's actions were clearly hurtful and the author is trying to point that out, the author isn't the asshole. The wrongdoer here is Jeff, not the one trying to correct him. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
