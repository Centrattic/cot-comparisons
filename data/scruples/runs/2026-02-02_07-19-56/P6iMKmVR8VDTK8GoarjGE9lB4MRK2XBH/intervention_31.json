Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person considering speaking up) is in the wrong for trying to explain to Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author had already given Liz a copy to let Jeff try before the gift. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Then, when receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it at the mall in front of Liz, who was upset. The author wants to confront Jeff about this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for stepping in. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nLooking at the facts: Jeff's actions\u2014returning the gift immediately without a word and in front of Liz\u2014could be hurtful. The author, as a close friend, is concerned about Liz's feelings and Jeff's thoughtlessness. The author's intention is to explain that Jeff's handling was poor, not to attack him but to make him aware.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: Maybe the author is overstepping by interfering in Jeff and Liz's relationship. Or perhaps the author shouldn't meddle in how Jeff reacts to gifts. However, since the author is a close friend and witnessed the situation, their concern is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff's actions were definitely inconsiderate. The author's intent is to help Jeff see that, which is a good-natured effort. The author isn't being confrontational but is trying to explain the impact of Jeff's actions. The key is whether the author's intervention is justified. Since the author is Jeff's best friend, it's reasonable for them to address this, especially to protect Liz's feelings.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
