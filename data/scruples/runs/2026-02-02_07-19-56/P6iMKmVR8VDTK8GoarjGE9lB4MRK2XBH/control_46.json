Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (me) is in the wrong for advising Jeff about how he handled his birthday gift from Liz. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Jeff received Mario Party from Liz. Before the birthday, I let him play my copy so he'd be familiar. On his birthday, he didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Then when he received the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which upset Liz.\n\nThe key points here are: Did Jeff handle the gift poorly? The user is considering if they should tell him that. The question is if I'm the asshole for trying to explain that to him.\n\nFrom Jeff's perspective: He's the birthday person, so he might feel entitled to choose the activity. He returned the gift, which seems hurtful to Liz. But maybe he didn't mean to be rude. He thought the other game was better for them. \n\nBut the problem is how he handled it. Returning the gift immediately and in front of Liz, especially after she asked if it was a good gift, shows a lack of consideration. The author wants to point out that Jeff's actions were hurtful, which might be seen as stepping in, but is it their place?\n\nThe user is my friend, so giving feedback as a friend could be justified. The author isn't trying to take sides but help Jeff understand his mistake. Friends often give advice, so maybe it's not wrong. However, if Jeff isn't open to feedback, maybe it's a bad idea. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author has the right to give that advice. Since it's a best friend, it's likely acceptable. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help a friend who might have hurt his girlfriend without realizing it.\n"
