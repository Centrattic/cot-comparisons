Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves Jeff's birthday and his reaction to the gift from his girlfriend, Liz.\n\nFirst, the author (probably the person posting the question) was there and might be considering confronting Jeff about his actions. The key points are: Jeff returned the gift immediately in front of Liz, who had asked for his opinion on the gift beforehand, and he replaced it with a game he preferred but which Liz didn't like. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to figure out if advising Jeff here is justified or if the author is overstepping. \n\nJeff's actions seem hurtful. He didn't appreciate the thought behind the gift, and returning it right away, especially in a way that made Liz upset, is probably not considerate. The author's intention is to explain that Jeff handled it poorly. Since the author was a witness and a friend, it's their role to offer advice if they think Jeff's behavior was wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have addressed it at the time or considered Jeff's perspective. But given that Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, the author might be right to step in. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to point this out. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the author is trying to help a friend who made a mistake, not being the asshole themselves. The wrong here is on Jeff for how he handled the gift, not the author for pointing it out.\n"
