Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jeff got a birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz, which was Super Mario Party. The author had already offered to use their own copy so Jeff could be familiar with the game before his birthday. Then, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. Later, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed. Then, when they went to the mall, Jeff returned the gift immediately, causing Liz to be upset, and he rationalized it by saying they wouldn't appreciate Mario Party, even though Liz likes Eevee.\n\nThe author is considering whether to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do so.\n\nHmm. The author's role here is a friend trying to help Jeff realize his mistake. The main issue is Jeff's reaction to the gift and returning it in front of Liz. The author is stepping in to point out that Jeff's behavior was poor.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. Jeff's actions were the problem. He received a gift, expressed disappointment, and then returned it immediately, which hurt Liz. The author's intention is to address Jeff's behavior, which was the main issue. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
