Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author if the Super Mario Party gift would be good. The author had a copy and offered to play it so Jeff could be familiar with the game. That seems okay, maybe even helpful. Then on Jeff's birthday, when the author suggested playing Mario Party, Jeff wasn't interested and wanted to play Smash Ultimate. The author and others conceded, so maybe they didn't push the issue. \n\nWhen Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and said it wasn't what he wanted. Then, when they went to the mall, Jeff immediately went to return the game for another one. Liz was upset, and Jeff tried to justify it by saying he knew Liz liked Eevee. \n\nThe author is considering explaining that returning the gift in front of Liz was wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this explanation.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The key points are: Jeff returned the gift immediately, which upset Liz. The author is a friend who might be stepping in. \n\nIs Jeff's action wrong? He returned a gift without consulting Liz, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's intention is to explain that this was poor handling. If the author's advice is meant to help Jeff realize his mistake, maybe that's justified. But maybe the author shouldn't meddle? \n\nBut the author was part of the situation, since they played the game beforehand. Also, Jeff's actions hurt Liz. As Jeff's best friend, the author might feel responsible to correct his behavior. So the author isn't the asshole here. Jeff's actions were the problem, not the author wanting to explain that. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
