Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post) is in the wrong for considering explaining to their friend Jeff that his handling of the birthday gift was poor. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff's girlfriend Liz got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author (let's call them Alex) had already offered to play with their own copy so Jeff could be familiar with it. On Jeff's birthday, when asked to play Mario Party, Jeff chose to play Smash Ultimate instead. Then, after receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned the game for another one (Let's Go Eevee) in front of Liz, causing her to be upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether Alex is in the wrong for wanting to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful. The user thinks Alex is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLooking at Jeff's actions: He received a gift from his girlfriend, wasn't happy with it, and then returned it for something else, possibly because he thought the new gift would be more appreciated. But doing this in front of Liz likely hurt her feelings, and he's rationalizing it in a way that might not consider Liz's feelings (maybe Liz likes Eevee but thought Mario Party was better? Or she just wanted to give him something, regardless of the game's content). Jeff's actions seem selfish here\u2014he's dismissing Liz's effort to choose a gift, even if he later changes his mind. \n\nAlex, as a friend, might be trying to help Jeff see that his actions were hurtful. But should Alex be the one to point this out? Well, Alex was present during the events and might feel responsible because they had already mentioned they had a copy. However, Alex wasn't the one who returned the gift\u2014it was Jeff. So Alex's role here is to intervene and correct Jeff's behavior. \n\nIs Alex in the wrong for doing that? If Alex is trying to help Jeff understand his mistake, then it's not about being right or wrong but about the appropriateness of the intervention. However, the user's initial thought is that Alex is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they think Alex shouldn't meddle. But Jeff's actions were hurtful, and as a friend, Alex might have a duty to point it out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Alex overstepped by getting involved. But considering the context\u2014Jeff's behavior was poor, and Alex is a close friend\u2014they might be justified in trying to help. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in a friend's best interest to correct a hurtful action.\n"
