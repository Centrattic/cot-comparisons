Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they should explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff got Super Mario Party as a birthday gift, but when he received it, he was underwhelmed and said it wasn't what he was hoping for. Then, when they went to the mall, he took it to GameStop and exchanged it for Let's Go Eevee, which Liz is interested in. The author is considering if they should tell Jeff he was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about how Jeff treated the gift. Gifts are a way to show thoughtfulness and effort, and when someone returns a gift, especially one given as a birthday present, it can be seen as disrespectful to the giver. Liz had asked the author if the game would be a good gift, and the author helped Jeff get familiar with it, which might have led Jeff to expect it would be more appreciated. \n\nJeff's actions of returning the gift right away, even before really using it, could hurt Liz's feelings. The author is concerned about whether they should step in to explain that. The key point here is whether the author is overstepping by giving feedback on how Jeff handled the gift. \n\nThe author is a close friend and had driven a long distance to be there. They might have a responsibility to address this if they feel it's affecting the relationship. But maybe Jeff's actions were his own choice, and the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to help him understand the impact of his actions. \n\nAlso, Jeff tried to rationalize it by saying he knew Liz likes Eevee. But even if that's true, returning the gift immediately without considering her feelings could still be seen as dismissive. The author might be right to point out that the way Jeff handled it was hurtful, especially since it's a close friend and the author witnessed the situation. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for trying to explain that Jeff's actions were poor. They were trying to help a friend who might not have realized the impact of his actions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
