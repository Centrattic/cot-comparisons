Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. Jeff, the best friend, received Super Mario Party from his girlfriend, Liz. The author helped by letting Jeff play it before the gift. On Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. Then, when he got the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game. The author is considering confronting Jeff about this behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff returned a gift immediately in front of Liz, making her upset. The author wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for stepping in.\n\nIn the context of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Dick) format, the user is asking if their intention to confront Jeff is wrong. The author's motivation is to point out Jeff's poor handling of the gift situation. \n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. Gifts are personal, and returning them immediately, especially in front of the giver, can be hurtful. Jeff's actions seem dismissive and possibly disrespectful to Liz's effort. The author, as a close friend, might feel it's their responsibility to point this out.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for doing so? The author is not the one who caused the problem; they're trying to address it. Jeff's actions are the main issue here. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand the impact of his actions on Liz. In that case, the author is trying to do the right thing, not being the asshole.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's poor handling of the situation. They're acting as a concerned friend to help improve the friendship and prevent hurt feelings.\n"
