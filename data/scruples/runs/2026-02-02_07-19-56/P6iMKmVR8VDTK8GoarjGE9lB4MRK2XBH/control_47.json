Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his girlfriend Liz's birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend Liz asked the author if Super Mario Party was a good gift, and the author had a copy, so they let Jeff try it out before the actual gift. On Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. Then when Liz gave him the Mario Party as a gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game. The author noticed that this made Liz upset and wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they would be the asshole (WIBTA) for stepping in. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, what's the main issue here? Jeff's behavior towards Liz. He received a gift, didn't like it, and immediately returned it in a way that embarrassed or hurt Liz. The author is considering telling Jeff this was poor handling of the gift. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for intervening? Well, the author is a friend trying to help Jeff see how his actions affected Liz. Jeff's actions seem inconsiderate. The author's intention is to explain the problem, not to humiliate Jeff. Friends often give each other advice, especially when it's about treating others well. However, maybe the author should consider how to approach it without being confrontational.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is wrong. If the author's intent is genuine and constructive, then they're not the asshole. Jeff's actions were the problem here. The author is trying to correct a friend's behavior, which is a common and reasonable thing to do in friendship. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is right to point out that Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, and offering to explain this is a responsible action.\n"
