Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a friend, Jeff, who received a gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author, who's the best friend, tried to help by letting Jeff try the game before the birthday. Then, on the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in the game they had played earlier and chose another one. When he got the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game. The author is considering if they should explain to Jeff that his reaction was poor.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They offered to let Jeff use their copy so he could get familiar with the game. That seems helpful. But maybe they should have let Jeff try it on his own after receiving the gift? By using the author's copy beforehand, maybe Jeff had biased expectations, thinking he already knew the game and thus wasn't as excited for the new copy. That could be a point against the author.\n\nThen, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party even though he had the author's copy. He chose Smash instead. That was his choice, maybe a bit dismissive of the gift, but not necessarily wrong. The problem comes when he returns the gift immediately. The way he did it\u2014going straight to GameStop right after receiving it\u2014could hurt Liz's feelings. The author is thinking of confronting Jeff about that.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for planning to explain this? Well, the author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake. But maybe the author contributed to the situation by letting Jeff use their copy beforehand, which might have made him less appreciative of the new copy. However, the main issue is Jeff's reaction to the gift. The author is the one trying to mediate here, so maybe they're not in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, could the author have handled it differently? Like, maybe not let Jeff use their copy before the gift? That's a possible angle. If the author had let Jeff open the gift first and try it out, maybe he wouldn't have been as underwhelmed. But the author's intention was to help Liz by making sure the game would be familiar. It backfired.\n\nSo, the author's role in enabling Jeff's disappointment might be part of the problem. But the main issue is Jeff's behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's mistake. The author isn't the one who returned the gift; they're trying to correct their friend's actions. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
