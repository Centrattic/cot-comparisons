Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled the birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly. \n\nFirst, the setup: Jeff got a Mario Party game for his 20th birthday. The author had a copy and offered it earlier so Jeff could try it. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed. Later, Jeff returned the game for another one right in front of Liz, who was upset.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff he messed up. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nThe key points here are about the author's intentions. The author's friend Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz. The author is trying to point out the mistake, not to be a jerk but to help. The situation is about being a good friend and supporting Liz's feelings.\n\nJeff's actions were inconsiderate. He returned an unopened gift in front of the giver, which is embarrassing and hurtful. The author, as a friend, might want to address this to prevent future issues. However, the author isn't the one who returned the gift; they were just an observer. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to explain the mistake. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his error, which could be seen as a positive action. Unless the author is being confrontational or spreading gossip, explaining the situation could be appropriate. However, if the author is inserting themselves into a personal matter without being asked, maybe they overstep. But given that Liz was upset and the author was present, it's a valid concern.\n\nIn many cases, friends step in when they see someone acting hurtfully. The author is not the one who caused the problem but is trying to mediate. So, the answer might be B (not wrong) because the author is trying to help a friend avoid hurting someone else. Unless the author is being judgmental without considering context, but the scenario doesn't show that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
