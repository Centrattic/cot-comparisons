Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for advising their friend Jeff on how he handled his birthday gift.\n\nFirst, Jeff got Super Mario Party from his girlfriend Liz. The author had suggested playing the game before the gift was given, which might have made Jeff less excited about the actual gift. Then on his birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. After receiving the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed and later returned it to get another game, which upset Liz. The author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were inappropriate.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong to step in. The key points are: Jeff's actions hurt Liz's feelings by returning the gift immediately in front of her. The author, as a friend, is concerned about Jeff's behavior. Generally, friends help each other avoid mistakes. Jeff's reaction to the gift could be seen as dismissive and not appreciative. The author's intention is to explain that Jeff's handling of the situation was poor, which is a valid concern because it affected Liz emotionally. \n\nThe author isn't trying to take sides but to point out that Jeff's actions might have been hurtful. Friends often give advice when they see someone acting in a way that could harm relationships. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to help Jeff understand his mistake. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
