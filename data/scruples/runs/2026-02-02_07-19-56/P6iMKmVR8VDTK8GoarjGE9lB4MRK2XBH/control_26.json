Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person asking) is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. Jeff got Mario Party from Liz, but he didn't like it. He returned it to get Eevee, which he thought Liz would like. The author is considering if it's appropriate to confront Jeff about this.\n\nSo, the main points here. Jeff's actions: he received a gift he didn't want, immediately returned it, and bought something else. The girlfriend was upset because he returned her thoughtful gift. The author is a best friend, so they're trying to help Jeff realize he was rude or ungrateful.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, returning a gift right away can be hurtful. Gifts are often about thoughtfulness and the gesture, not just the item. Jeff's reasoning was that he knew Liz would like Eevee more. But that's a bit presumptuous. He assumed he knew what she wanted better than she did, and then he returned her gift, which can make her feel her choice wasn't valued.\n\nThe author's intention is to help Jeff understand that his actions were inconsiderate. Since Jeff is the one who acted poorly, the author isn't the asshole here. The author is trying to be a supportive friend by pointing out the mistake. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe Jeff was just trying to be nice by getting Eevee. But the way he went about it\u2014returning the gift immediately in front of Liz\u2014was probably hurtful. The author's concern is valid because Jeff's actions could damage the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're trying to help their friend realize a mistake, which is a reasonable and caring action.\n"
