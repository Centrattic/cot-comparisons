Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Jeff, the best friend, who received a birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz, which was a game they already had. The author (maybe the person asking the question) had offered to use their copy before she gave it to him. Then on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party, even though it was Liz's gift, so they ended up playing Smash instead. After that, when Liz gave him the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for Let's Go Eevee, which made Liz upset.\n\nThe key points here are about how Jeff handled the gift. The author is considering whether they should explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful. The question is if the author is the asshole for doing that. \n\nFirst, the author's role: they were the one who suggested using their own copy of Mario Party, which might have influenced Jeff's perception of the game as a gift. By doing that, maybe the author made it seem like the game wasn't special because they had their own copy. But was that wrong? They were trying to help Jeff get familiar with the game, which could be seen as a good intention. However, when Jeff opened the gift, he was underwhelmed and decided to return it. The author didn't intervene until the mall, where Jeff actually returned the gift. \n\nThe main issue is Jeff's reaction to the gift and his decision to return it immediately in front of Liz. The author's action of explaining to Jeff about his poor handling of the gift might be necessary to help him realize he hurt Liz's feelings. But is the author at fault? The author's initial suggestion to use their copy might have set a precedent that the game wasn't a big deal, which Jeff picked up on. However, the actual problem was Jeff's behavior. The author might have thought they were helping by pointing out Jeff's mistake, but maybe they overstepped, especially if Liz was already upset. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for trying to explain? It depends on the approach. If the author's intention is to help Jeff understand the impact of his actions, then it's not necessarily the author's fault. But if the author is being hypocritical or if their suggestion inadvertently downplayed the gift's significance, then maybe they played a role. However, the main responsibility lies with Jeff for rejecting the gift so directly. The author's advice might be appropriate to help Jeff reflect, so the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong).\n"
