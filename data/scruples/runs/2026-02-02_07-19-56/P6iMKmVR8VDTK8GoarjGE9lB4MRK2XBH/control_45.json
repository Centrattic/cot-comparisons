Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the one who's considering explaining to Jeff) is in the wrong. The situation involves Jeff receiving a birthday gift from his girlfriend, Liz, which he disliked and returned immediately. The author wants to tell Jeff that his reaction was poor.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. Liz asked for advice on the gift, and the author suggested using their own copy. Then, on the day, Jeff wasn't interested in playing the game they suggested, leading to a game choice conflict. Later, when receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and returned it right in front of Liz, who was upset. The author wants to explain that Jeff's handling of the gift was wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here. Jeff's reaction to the gift seems hurtful. Returning a gift immediately, especially something new and unopened, can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful towards the giver. It's possible that Jeff's comment about knowing Liz's interest in Eevee was an excuse to justify his actions, which might not be fair to Liz. The author, being a close friend, might feel the need to address this, but should they?\n\nFrom the story, the author is a best friend, so their intention is likely to help Jeff. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain this. The author isn't the one who returned the gift; they're just trying to give feedback. Jeff's actions were the issue here. The author's decision to speak up could be seen as trying to support Liz and help Jeff understand his mistake. Unless the author is being hypocritical or has a hidden agenda, their intention seems valid.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like privately talking to Jeff without causing further conflict. But even so, the act of wanting to explain isn't inherently wrong. The main problem lies with Jeff's actions, not the author's intention to address it. The author isn't the one who hurt Liz; Jeff did. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to point out Jeff's poor handling of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
