Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for considering explaining their friend Jeff's poor handling of his birthday gift.\n\nFirst, let's outline the key points of the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author (WIBTA) had already played it with Jeff before the gift, so Liz thought it was a good idea. On the birthday, Jeff was not interested in playing Mario Party, so he chose Smash Ultimate instead. When he received the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which upset Liz. The author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to explain this to Jeff. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author has the right to intervene in Jeff's relationship matters. The author is a friend who drove a long distance to visit Jeff, so they were present during the incident. The author's intention is to point out that Jeff's actions may have hurt Liz, which seems well-meaning. Friends often give advice to each other, especially when they see a friend being unkind or causing hurt.\n\nHowever, there are factors to consider. The author might be overstepping if they are not certain about the situation. But in this case, the author witnessed Jeff's actions and their impact on Liz. The key is the intent and method of the explanation. If the author approaches Jeff respectfully and with the intention of helping, then it's not wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being judgmental or harsh, that could be a problem. But the scenario suggests the author is trying to help a friend avoid hurting their girlfriend, which is a common and reasonable concern among friends. So, the author's action is likely in good faith and not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
