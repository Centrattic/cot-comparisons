Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario) is in the wrong for planning to confront their friend Jeff about how he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author for advice about getting him Super Mario Party as a gift. The author had their own copy and suggested using it so Jeff could be familiar with the game. On Jeff's birthday, he didn't want to play Mario Party when asked, opting for Smash Ultimate instead. Then, after receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it to exchange for another game, causing emotional distress to Liz. The author is considering explaining to Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to confront Jeff. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is a friend who is concerned about Jeff's behavior. It's possible that the author's intention is to help Jeff realize that his actions were hurtful to Liz, which could be seen as a kind and supportive act. The author might believe that pointing out Jeff's actions is necessary to prevent further hurt or to encourage better communication between Jeff and Liz.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend Jeff may have his own reasons for his actions. He might feel that the gift wasn't what he wanted, and returning it could be a way to get something he actually likes. However, doing it in a way that's hurtful to Liz is problematic. The author's intervention could be seen as overstepping if Jeff didn't ask for advice. Additionally, the author might be taking sides with Liz without understanding Jeff's perspective fully.\n\nFactors to consider: The author's role as a friend is to mediate and help their friends. But they need to be careful not to impose their own judgment without understanding all the circumstances. Jeff's reaction to the gift wasn't just about the game; it's about how he felt the gift didn't meet his expectations. However, the way he handled it\u2014returning it immediately in front of Liz\u2014was clearly hurtful. The author's intention to explain the impact of Jeff's actions might be justified, but whether it's the right approach depends on how they communicate it.\n\nIn similar \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, the key is often the intent and the method of intervention. If the author is doing this to help Jeff see how his actions affected Liz, and if it's done respectfully without shaming Jeff, it might be appropriate. However, if the author is being judgmental or not considering Jeff's feelings or reasons, it could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: The author helped Liz choose the gift by suggesting they use their own copy, which might have influenced Liz's choice. Could that play a role in Jeff's disappointment? Maybe Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party at all, so Liz's gift was based on the author's suggestion, which might have been a misstep. But that's a different point.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is to address Jeff's poor handling of the gift situation. If the author approaches Jeff with the goal of helping him understand the impact on Liz and to encourage better communication, it's a supportive act. However, if the approach is confrontational or assumes guilt without understanding Jeff's motives, it might be seen as the author overstepping. The key is the method of explanation and the author's approach. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author might actually be in the right for trying to help, especially since Jeff's actions were hurtful. Therefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
