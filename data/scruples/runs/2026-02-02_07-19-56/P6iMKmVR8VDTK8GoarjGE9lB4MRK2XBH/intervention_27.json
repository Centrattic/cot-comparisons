Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend Jeff receiving a gift from his girlfriend Liz, a Mario Party game. The author had lent Jeff their copy before the birthday, which might have influenced Jeff's reaction. Then, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party when asked, chose Smash instead, and later returned the gift for another game. The author is considering confronting Jeff about this.\n\nFirst, the author's role: They helped Liz by letting Jeff play the game beforehand, which might have set up expectations. But was that a mistake? Maybe not. They wanted to ensure Jeff would like the game. However, when Jeff got the actual copy, he was underwhelmed. That's his reaction, but returning it right in front of Liz and going to GameStop seems hurtful.\n\nThe author now wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were poor. The key points here: Did the author have the right to intervene? The question is whether the author is wrong for stepping in. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate.\n\nJeff's actions were disrespectful to Liz. The author, as a friend, might feel responsible to address this. However, the author's initial action of lending the game could have inadvertently led to Jeff's expectations. But the main issue is Jeff's reaction. The author's intention is to correct Jeff's behavior, which might be justified. However, the author might be overstepping if they weren't asked to mediate. But since Jeff is a friend, it's reasonable to offer advice.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to explain Jeff's poor handling. Liz might need support, and the author's intervention is in her interest. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
