Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and their friend. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for suggesting that Jeff handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jeff received Super Mario Party from Liz, which he didn't really like. Then, during the birthday, Jeff chose to play Smash Ultimate instead of the game Liz bought. Later, he returned the gift to get a different game, which upset Liz. The author wants to explain this to Jeff.\n\nNow, the key points here: Jeff is the one who returned the gift. The author's role was more of a participant and observer. The author did offer their own copy of Mario Party earlier, which might have influenced Jeff's familiarity, but the decision to return the gift was Jeff's. The author is now considering confronting Jeff about his actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for stepping in. If the author is just giving feedback to help Jeff understand his friend's hurt, that's one thing. But if the author's actions led to the situation, maybe they have some responsibility. However, the main issue here is Jeff's actions, not the author's. The author's initial offer to use their own copy might have been a mistake, but the main problem is Jeff's reaction to the gift. The author is trying to explain that Jeff's behavior was hurtful to Liz. Since the author isn't the one who returned the gift, their intention to explain is likely to help Jeff realize his mistake. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The author is not the one at fault here.\n"
