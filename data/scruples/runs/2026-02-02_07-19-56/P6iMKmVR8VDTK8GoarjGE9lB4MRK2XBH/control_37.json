Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario) is in the wrong for planning to explain to Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party. The author had already played it with Jeff before the birthday. On the birthday, Jeff chose to play Smash instead. When Liz gave the gift, Jeff was unimpressed. Then, Jeff returned the gift immediately at the mall in front of Liz, who was upset. The author wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). The author's action here is the intention to explain Jeff's poor handling of the gift. Jeff's actions\u2014returning the gift right away and in front of Liz\u2014seem inconsiderate. The author is stepping in to address this, which could be seen as mediation. \n\nBut why might the author be in the wrong? If the author is overstepping by giving unsolicited advice, especially in a personal matter between Jeff and Liz. However, since they're friends, offering feedback might be seen as helping. On the other hand, if Jeff's actions were indeed hurtful, the author's intention to explain could be justified. \n\nFactors to consider: Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, the girlfriend. The author noticed this and wants to address it. The author's role here is a friend trying to help another friend. But does the author have the right to intervene? If Jeff and Liz's relationship issues are their own, the author might be mediating where it's not necessary. However, since the author was present and witnessed the hurt caused, stepping in could be seen as helping Jeff avoid repeated mistakes. \n\nIn similar situations, people often appreciate friends pointing out their faults, especially if it helps them improve relationships. The key here is that the author is not taking sides but pointing out Jeff's inconsiderate behavior. So, the author's intention is to help Jeff, not to criticize Liz or meddle. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
