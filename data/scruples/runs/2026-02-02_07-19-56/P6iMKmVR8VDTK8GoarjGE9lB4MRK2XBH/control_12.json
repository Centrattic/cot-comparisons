Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jeff got Mario Party from his girlfriend Liz. The author, who's a friend, had already used their own copy before the gift was given. On Jeff's birthday, he wanted to play Smash instead, which they did. Then when Liz gave him the gift, Jeff seemed unimpressed and later returned it for Let's Go Eevee, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff that returning the gift right away was a bad move. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, is the author justified in their intention to advise Jeff? Well, Jeff's actions might have hurt Liz's feelings. The author's motivation is likely to help Jeff see how his behavior affected Liz. Friends often give advice when they think someone's actions are harmful. The author isn't doing anything directly harmful themselves; they're planning to explain why Jeff's actions were poor.\n\nJeff's behavior\u2014being underwhelmed, returning the gift immediately in front of Liz\u2014could be seen as dismissive and unappreciative. The author's intention is to point out that this might have upset Liz, which is a valid concern. The key here is whether the author's intervention is meddling or well-meaning. Since the author is Jeff's friend and was present, they have context and are trying to help him understand the impact of his actions. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author is being malicious. They're trying to help a friend avoid hurting their girlfriend. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author's advice is constructive and aimed at improving Jeff's relationship, not causing trouble.\n"
