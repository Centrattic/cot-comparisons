Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person considering giving advice to Jeff) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to Jeff that he handled the birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. She consulted the author about the gift first. The author had a copy and let Jeff play it before the gift. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Then, when receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which hurt Liz's feelings. The author is considering telling Jeff that returning the gift immediately was wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to address this. \n\nThe author isn't the one who did the action; they're considering advising Jeff. The key here is intent and the approach. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake and prevent hurting Liz again. Since the author is Jeff's friend, it's reasonable to give feedback, especially if it's done constructively. The author isn't interfering in their relationship but pointing out Jeff's behavior that could be detrimental. \n\nJeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, and the author is trying to help him see that. There's no indication that the author is being malicious. So the author's intention is to help, not to be an asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
