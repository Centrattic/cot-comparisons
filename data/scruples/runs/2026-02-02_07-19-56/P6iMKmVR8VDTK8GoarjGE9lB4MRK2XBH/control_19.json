Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is the asshole for wanting to explain to their friend (Jeff) that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend (Liz) poorly. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff got a gift from Liz, Super Mario Party. The author had already let Jeff try the game before the birthday. On the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose to play Smash Ultimate instead. Then, when Liz gave him the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, Let's Go Eevee, in front of her, which upset her. The author is considering if they should explain to Jeff that his actions were poor.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole if they step in here? The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nLet me break down the key points. Jeff's actions: he received a gift, then immediately returned it for something else, which his girlfriend had already bought for him. That seems pretty hurtful. The author is thinking of explaining to Jeff that this was a bad move. \n\nBut why would the author be in the wrong? Well, maybe because Jeff is the one who did something wrong, so the author is justified in pointing that out. However, maybe the author is overstepping if they're not directly involved. But in this case, the author is a best friend who drove 250 miles to see him, so they might feel invested in the situation.\n\nJeff's behavior seems a bit inconsiderate. He didn't even try to hide his disappointment in the gift. Then returning it for something else that his girlfriend had already purchased (Let's Go Eevee) suggests that he knew what he wanted and maybe didn't communicate that to Liz. That's pretty hurtful to Liz. The author is trying to help Jeff see that his actions hurt Liz. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain this. The user is asking if the author would be the asshole for doing so. \n\nIn similar situations, friends often help each other avoid hurting others. So the author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake. Unless the author is being malicious, their intention is good. Jeff's actions were wrong, not the author's for pointing it out. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have addressed it earlier. But since it's after the fact, explaining it now could still be helpful. Also, considering that Liz was holding back tears, this is a sensitive situation. The author's friend is acting in a way that's damaging their relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to point this out. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're trying to help their friend avoid making a mistake that could harm his relationship. Jeff's actions were the problem, not the author's intention to explain it.\n"
