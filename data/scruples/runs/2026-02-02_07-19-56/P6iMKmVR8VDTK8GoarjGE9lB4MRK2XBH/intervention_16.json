Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for trying to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff's girlfriend Liz bought him Super Mario Party for his 20th birthday. The author had a copy already and offered to let Jeff use it before the birthday. Then, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and insisted on playing Smash Ultimate instead. Later, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed. Then, at the mall, Jeff returned the gift and got a different game, which upset Liz. The author wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful to Liz.\n\nThe author is considering if they're the asshole (WIBTA) for stepping in to explain Jeff's mistake.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The answer options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nNow, to analyze: The key points are whether the author is justified in intervening. The author was present during the events and witnessed Jeff's actions that hurt Liz. The author's friend might be acting out of self-interest, not considering Liz's feelings. The author's intention is to point out the hurtful behavior, which could be seen as trying to help a friend avoid damaging their relationship. However, the author might be overstepping if they aren't asked to intervene. Alternatively, the author might be protecting Liz by addressing the issue.\n\nBut in the scenario, the author is a best friend, which might give them the right to give honest feedback. The main issue is whether Jeff's actions were wrong, and the author is trying to correct that. The author isn't directly causing harm but is pointing out Jeff's mistakes. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't the one who returned the gift, so stepping in to explain could be seen as helping Liz and Jeff communicate better. On the other hand, the author might be mediating a personal matter that's not their direct concern unless Jeff asked for advice. But since the author was present and part of the events, their intervention could be justified as a concerned friend.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) framework, the author is considering if their action (explaining Jeff's poor handling) would make them the asshole. The key factors are intent and context. The author's intent is to help Jeff realize his mistake, which is likely a good intention. The method might be where the line is blurred\u2014how they approach Jeff could affect whether it's constructive or confrontational.\n\nIn the original scenario, Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz. The author, as a friend, is trying to address this. The answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because they're trying to help a friend avoid hurting their partner, especially since Jeff's actions were immediate and visible. The author isn't the one who caused the problem but is seeking to mitigate it by communication.\n"
