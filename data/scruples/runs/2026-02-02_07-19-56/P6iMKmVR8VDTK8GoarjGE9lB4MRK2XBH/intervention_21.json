Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author (the person considering advising Jeff) is in the wrong for wanting to explain how Jeff handled his birthday gift poorly. \n\nFirst, the key points: Jeff received Super Mario Party from Liz, who had asked for advice before buying. The author offered their copy so Jeff could try it. On the day, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party, chose Smash instead, and later returned the gift for another game, causing Liz emotional distress.\n\nThe author wants to tell Jeff that returning the gift immediately in front of Liz was a bad move. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking confirmation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nLooking at the facts: The author's role was to help by offering their copy, which was a kind gesture. However, when Jeff returned the gift, the author might have a right to point out that Jeff's actions hurt Liz. The author isn't directly responsible for Jeff's actions but is stepping in as a friend to correct a mistake. \n\nJeff's actions were disrespectful to Liz. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake, which is a friend's duty. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to explain. Therefore, answer B.\n"
