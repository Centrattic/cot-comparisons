Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the person writing the question) is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, bought him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author had a copy already and offered to let Jeff use it before the birthday. Then, on the actual birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned the Mario Party game for another one, which upset Liz. The author is considering stepping in to explain to Jeff that his actions were poor.\n\nThe key points here are about how Jeff handled the gift. Liz put effort into getting the game, Jeff didn't like it, and then immediately returned it in front of her. The author wants to intervene. The question is whether the author is wrong to do so.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Jeff's behavior seems hurtful. Returning a gift on the same day it's given, especially when it's from a romantic partner, can be seen as dismissive. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand that his actions were inappropriate. Intervening in a friend's behavior to prevent hurt feelings might be seen as kind, not wrong. However, the author needs to consider if Jeff is open to feedback and if the approach is respectful.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's plan is to explain the poor handling, not to confront or humiliate Jeff. Since the author is trying to mediate a situation where Liz was upset and Jeff's actions could damage the relationship, the author's intervention seems justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
