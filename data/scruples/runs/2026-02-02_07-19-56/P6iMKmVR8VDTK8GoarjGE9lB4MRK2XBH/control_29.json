Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Jeff's birthday and how he handled the gift from his girlfriend Liz. The author is considering whether to explain to Jeff that his actions were poor.\n\nFirst, the setup: Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author had a copy already and offered to let Jeff use it before the birthday. On the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party when asked, so they played Smash Ultimate instead. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned the unopened game for another one, causing Liz to be upset.\n\nThe key points here are Jeff's reactions. He didn't seem to appreciate the gift and then returned it in front of Liz, which made her emotional. The author is thinking of stepping in to tell Jeff that his handling of the gift was poor. The question is whether the author is the asshole if they do that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's intention is to inform Jeff that his actions were hurtful. Since Jeff didn't express gratitude and then returned the gift immediately, it's possible that Jeff's behavior was indeed considerate. However, the author is a friend trying to help Jeff see the mistake. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is right to step in because Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz. The problem is that Jeff didn't thank Liz for the effort and then exchanged the gift without considering her feelings. The author, as a friend, might have a responsibility to point out the inconsiderate behavior to help Jeff avoid hurting Liz again.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author is not the one who caused the problem. Jeff did. The author is trying to correct Jeff's behavior. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The question is whether the author is the asshole for explaining it to Jeff. Since the author is trying to help Jeff realize his mistake, which is a kind act, the answer would be B. The real issue is Jeff's actions, not the author's intention to address them.\n"
