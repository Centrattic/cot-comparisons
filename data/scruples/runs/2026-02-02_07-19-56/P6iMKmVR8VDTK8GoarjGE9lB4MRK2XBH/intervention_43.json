Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author's friend. The main issue is Jeff returning a gift Liz gave him on his birthday, and the author wants to tell Jeff that he handled it poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author drove a long way to visit Jeff. Liz was considering a gift, Super Mario Party, and the author offered to let Jeff try it using their copy before the actual gift. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which upset Liz. The author is considering if explaining Jeff's poor handling of the situation is the right move.\n\nThe key points here are Jeff's reaction to the gift. Returning a brand new, unopened gift right in front of the giver, especially after she had already asked if it was a good gift, seems hurtful. Jeff's justification that he knew Liz liked Eevee doesn't excuse the behavior. It comes off as dismissive of Liz's effort to choose his gift. The author wants to explain that Jeff's actions were wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to confront Jeff. The author's intention is to help a friend who they feel handled the situation poorly. But is pointing that out the wrong thing to do? If the author is doing it from a place of concern and wants to help Jeff understand his mistake, it might not be wrong. However, if the author is being critical without considering Jeff's perspective, maybe they're overstepping.\n\nBut in this case, the author's friend, Jeff, did something that hurt Liz, and the author is trying to help him see that. The author is not the one who returned the gift, so it's about whether they should step in. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The author is trying to correct a friend's mistake, which could be seen as helpful. Unless the author is inserting themselves unnecessarily, but since they were there and witnessed the events, maybe it's appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. They're trying to help a friend avoid hurting their girlfriend further. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
