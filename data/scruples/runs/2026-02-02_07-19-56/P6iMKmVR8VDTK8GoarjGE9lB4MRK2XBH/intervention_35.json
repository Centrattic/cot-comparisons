Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. The situation involves Jeff receiving a gift from his girlfriend Liz, which he wasn't thrilled with and ended up returning for another game. The author is considering stepping in to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Jeff was given a gift, which he found underwhelming and returned immediately. The author wants to tell Jeff that this was rude. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nJeff's actions: He returned the gift in front of Liz, who was upset. That's clearly hurtful. Liz had asked for advice on the gift beforehand, showing she wanted to get it right. Jeff's response of being underwhelmed and then returning it without consideration for her feelings is problematic. The author's intention is to point out the mistake to help Jeff understand the impact of his actions. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe Jeff's actions were his own choice, and the author overstepping by intervening. But considering that the author was present and saw Liz's emotional reaction, they might feel responsible for addressing it. Also, the author had prior involvement by suggesting using their own copy, which might have influenced Jeff's expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's role as a friend is to support both Jeff and Liz. However, directly confronting Jeff about his behavior could create tension. The question is whether the author is the asshole for trying to explain the wrong. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author wants to do the right thing by pointing out that Jeff's actions were hurtful. Even if Jeff's actions were his own, the author's intervention is to help him see the impact. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to mediate and support Liz's feelings. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
