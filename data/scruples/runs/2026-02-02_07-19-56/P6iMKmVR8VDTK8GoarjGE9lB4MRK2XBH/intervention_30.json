Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to Jeff that his handling of the birthday gift was poor.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff got a gift from his girlfriend, Liz, which was a game they already had. Jeff didn't like it and immediately returned it for another game, which upset Liz. The author, who was present, is considering if they should correct Jeff.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet's break down the key points. Jeff's actions: he returned the gift right in front of Liz, which is hurtful. He used the excuse that he knew Liz liked Eevee, but that's not a good reason to return a gift on the same day. The author wants to explain that Jeff's actions were poor.\n\nThe author's role: They had already offered to use their copy of the game before the gift was given, which might have made Jeff less enthusiastic. Then, during the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play the game and chose another. After receiving the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it. The author is now considering intervening.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to explain this? Well, the author is trying to help a friend who's acting inconsiderately towards his girlfriend. Jeff's actions were hurtful, so pointing that out might be necessary. However, the author's role as a third party could be seen as overstepping, but given the context, it's a friend trying to help another friend avoid a conflict.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's intention is well-meaning. The author wants to explain Jeff's poor handling of the situation, which is a valid concern. The user thought the author was wrong, but I think the author is right to step in because Jeff's actions were inconsiderate. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
