Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author if the Mario Party game would be a good gift. The author had a copy and offered to play it so Jeff would be familiar, which seems helpful. Then on Jeff's birthday, when the author suggested Mario Party, Jeff wasn't interested and chose Smash instead. That was fine, and they had fun. Then Liz gave the Mario Party gift, and Jeff was underwhelmed. Later, Jeff went straight to GameStop to return it for another game, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author is now considering telling Jeff that his actions were poor. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case.\n\nThe key points here are: Did Jeff's actions harm Liz, and does the author have a right to intervene? Jeff returned the gift Liz bought, which was clearly hurtful. The author was present and witnessed Liz's emotional reaction. By returning the gift so quickly without considering Liz's feelings, Jeff's actions were unkind. The author's intention to address this isn't to criticize but to help Jeff understand the impact of his actions. \n\nIs the author overstepping? As a close friend, the author might feel responsible to point out the hurt caused. However, maybe the author should have addressed it immediately when it happened instead of waiting. On the other hand, Jeff's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's motive is to help. The author isn't attacking Liz but pointing out Jeff's mistake. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I think the author's concern is valid. Jeff's actions were the issue, not the author's intention to explain. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to correct their friend's poor judgment. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
