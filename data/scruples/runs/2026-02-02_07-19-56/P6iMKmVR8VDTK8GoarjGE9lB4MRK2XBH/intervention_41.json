Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the one asking the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: Jeff received a gift from Liz, which was Super Mario Party. The author had suggested trying the game beforehand so Jeff would be familiar with it. On his birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game. The author is considering confronting Jeff about this.\n\nThe main issues here are how Jeff reacted to the gift. He returned it immediately, which hurt Liz's feelings. The author wants to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking another perspective.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake. If the author is a friend concerned about Jeff's relationship with Liz, it's reasonable to address it. However, maybe the author overstepped by getting involved in the first place. When Liz asked if the gift would be good, the author offered their own copy. That might have influenced Liz's choice or made her think Jeff would like it more. Then, when Jeff was underwhelmed, the author didn't immediately speak up, leading to the situation where Jeff returns the gift. The author might share some responsibility for not advising Jeff to be more appreciative at the time. But the main question is whether explaining Jeff's mistake now is the author being in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend Jeff is the one who actually handled the gift poorly. The author is trying to help Jeff realize his mistake, which is a good intention. However, if the author's prior actions (like suggesting using their own copy) contributed to the problem, maybe they should have addressed that earlier. But the act of explaining the hurt caused by Jeff's actions now might not be the author's fault. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's role in the initial suggestion, the timing of their intervention, and the intent behind it. If the author's main goal is to help Jeff understand his mistake and prevent further harm to his relationship, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is overstepping by giving unsolicited advice, they might be. But in this context, since the author is Jeff's friend and the situation is sensitive, the author's concern is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
