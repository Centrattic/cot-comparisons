Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend poorly. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author if the Mario Party game was a good gift. The author had a copy already and suggested using it so Jeff could be familiar. Then on the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash instead. After that, Liz gave the gift, and Jeff was underwhelmed. Later, Jeff returned the game for another one, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author wants to tell Jeff that returning the gift in front of Liz was poor handling. The key points here are: Jeff returned a gift immediately, in front of the giver, and justified it by saying he didn't like it and thought the other game was better. The author is stepping in to point out that this was hurtful to Liz.\n\nNow, considering the rules of social interactions and relationships, returning a gift immediately and in front of the person who gave it is generally considered rude. Gifts are meant to be a gesture of thoughtfulness and affection. Dismissing it so quickly can make the giver feel unappreciated. Jeff's actions here are likely to have hurt Liz's feelings, especially since she had asked the author about the gift beforehand, showing she wanted to choose something appropriate.\n\nThe author is trying to help Jeff realize his mistake. While it's a friend's situation, the author's intention is to prevent further hurt. However, whether the author is in the wrong depends on their approach. If they're being confrontational or critical without considering Jeff's perspective, maybe. But given that the author has a history with Jeff (best friends) and had a copy of the game already, their concern is to avoid Liz feeling disrespected.\n\nIn situations like this, it's common for friends to give feedback, especially if they see a loved one being hurt. The key is whether the author's intent is to help Jeff understand his mistake without being judgmental. Since the question is about being \"the asshole,\" if the author is genuinely concerned and wants to prevent hurt feelings, they're not the one in the wrong. Jeff's actions were the issue here, not the author's intention to address it.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're trying to mediate a situation where Jeff's actions were hurtful, and their intervention is appropriate to prevent further harm to Liz and to help Jeff understand his mistake.\n"
