Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. The situation is about Jeff's birthday and how he handled a gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author is a friend who might want to explain to Jeff that he messed up.\n\nFirst, the facts: Liz asked if the gift (Super Mario Party) would be good, and the author suggested using their own copy so Jeff could be familiar. Then on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. When Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it at GameStop in front of her, which upset her. The author is considering telling Jeff that returning the gift like that was wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain this. The key points here are about how Jeff handled the gift. Gifts are personal, and returning them, especially in front of the giver, can be hurtful. Even if the gift wasn't wanted, the way Jeff did it seems inconsiderate. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake, which is a valid concern. Since the author wasn't the one who returned the gift or made the comment, they aren't the one at fault. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
