Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author (let's call them the narrator) had already given Liz a copy to let Jeff try it out. On Jeff's birthday, he didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. Then, when he received the actual Mario Party gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for a different game, which upset Liz. The narrator wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nNow, the key points here. The narrator isn't the one who returned the gift; Jeff did. The narrator is considering intervening to explain that Jeff's behavior was wrong. The question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for wanting to do that.\n\nIs the narrator wrong for stepping in? Well, Jeff's action of returning the gift immediately and in front of Liz was hurtful. The narrator is a friend who cares and wants to help Jeff understand the impact of his actions. Since Jeff didn't appreciate the gift and acted in a way that upset Liz, the narrator's intention is to help him see the problem. The narrator isn't causing the issue but is trying to mediate or advise, which is a common friend behavior when someone does something thoughtless.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. If the narrator's approach is confrontational or unsolicited, that could be an issue. But the question is about whether the narrator is in the wrong for wanting to explain, not how they do it. The act of trying to point out a friend's mistake to prevent future hurt isn't necessarily wrong. Jeff's actions were clearly problematic, so the narrator's intention is to correct that behavior, not to take blame for Jeff's actions.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the narrator isn't in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's poor handling of the situation.\n"
