Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend, Jeff, that he handled his birthday gift poorly from his girlfriend, Liz.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation step by step. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, bought him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author (the narrator) was present and had already played it with Jeff before the birthday. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. After the gift was given, Jeff seemed unimpressed, and later returned the game for another one, Let's Go Eevee, in front of Liz who was upset. The author is considering whether to tell Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are: Jeff returned the gift immediately in front of Liz, which upset her, and he rationalized it by saying he knew Liz was interested in Eevee. The author wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were poor handling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, we need to consider if the author has the right to intervene. The author is a close friend (best friend) who was present during the incident. They might be trying to help Jeff realize the impact of his actions on Liz. However, the author's role here is that of a friend. \n\nThe author's actions depend on how they approach the conversation. If they're being honest and constructive, it's a valid concern. The main issue is whether Jeff's handling of the gift was indeed poor. Returning a gift immediately, especially when the giver is present, can be seen as dismissive and hurtful. The author is pointing out Jeff's behavior, which could be seen as trying to help a friend avoid hurting his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping if they're not the one to give that feedback. However, since they were present and involved, it seems reasonable for them to address it, especially if they noticed Liz's emotional reaction. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to explain the situation. The right answer would be B (No).\n"
