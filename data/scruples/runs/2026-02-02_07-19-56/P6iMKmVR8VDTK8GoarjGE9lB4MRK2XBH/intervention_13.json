Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend poorly. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author, who's a friend, had already offered to use their own copy so Jeff could try it out before receiving it. Then, on the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned the game for something else, which upset Liz.\n\nThe author is considering confronting Jeff about this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did Jeff handle the situation poorly? The author is stepping in to explain that, but is the author in the wrong for doing that?\n\nJeff's actions\u2014returning the gift immediately after receiving it in front of his girlfriend\u2014could be seen as hurtful. He didn't express gratitude and replaced it without considering Liz's feelings. The author's intention is to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful. But is the author right to intervene?\n\nThe author is a friend, so they might feel it's their role to call out Jeff's behavior. However, maybe Jeff's actions were his own choice, and the author shouldn't meddle. Also, the author had a role in initially suggesting using the game, which might have contributed to Jeff's underwhelmed reaction.\n\nBut considering that Jeff returned the gift, which is a direct reflection on Liz's choice, the author might think Jeff was unappreciative. The author's advice could be constructive, but is it the author's place to step in? \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Jeff's actions were hurtful, and the author, as a friend, wants to help him realize that. However, the way the author approaches Jeff matters. If the author is doing it in a supportive way, then it's okay. But if it's confrontational, maybe not. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain, not the method. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is trying to help Jeff understand his mistake, which is a good intention. Jeff's actions were hurtful, so the author is right to point that out.\n"
