Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step. The main question is whether the author would be the asshole (WIBTA) if they explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend poorly.\n\nFirst, let's recap the events. Jeff got a gift from his girlfriend Liz, which was a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch. The author helped by offering their own copy so Jeff could try it before the gift. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party, opting for Smash Ultimate instead. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was unimpressed and later returned it for another game in front of her, making her upset. The author is considering telling Jeff that he handled this poorly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about whether Jeff's actions were inconsiderate towards Liz. Gifts are a personal gesture, and returning a gift immediately, especially in front of the giver, can be hurtful. Jeff's actions seem to disregard Liz's feelings. The author is thinking about pointing this out to Jeff, but is that the right move?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that Jeff's behavior was thoughtless, especially since Liz was visibly upset. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake. However, the author needs to consider if they have the right to intervene here. Are they overstepping by criticizing Jeff's actions? Or is it a friendly advice as a best friend?\n\nOn one hand, the author is a friend trying to do the right thing. On the other hand, the situation is between Jeff and Liz. The author might not have all the context of their relationship. Maybe Jeff and Liz have a history where this wasn't a big deal. But given that Liz was holding back tears, it's clear she was hurt.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to explain the situation. The question is whether the author's action (explaining Jeff's poor handling) makes them the asshole. \n\nIn similar situations, if someone is trying to help a friend see how their actions affected others, they're usually not the asshole. The key is the approach. If the author does it in a respectful, non-confrontational way, it's likely well-intentioned. However, if they're being judgmental or harsh, that could be problematic. The scenario doesn't mention the tone or approach, but the author's intent is to explain, not to attack.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help a friend realize a mistake that hurt someone they care about. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
