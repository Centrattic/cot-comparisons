Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for trying to explain to their friend (Jeff) that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jeff received a Mario Party game from his girlfriend Liz. He ended up returning it for Let's Go Eevee. The author is considering stepping in to tell Jeff that his actions were hurtful to Liz.\n\nThe author's friend Jeff is the one who acted poorly by returning the gift immediately in front of Liz, making her upset. The author's role here is as a friend trying to correct Jeff's behavior. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to assess that.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for intervening? If Jeff's actions were hurtful, then pointing that out is a good friend's action. The author isn't the one who returned the gift; Jeff did. So the author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake and maybe prevent future issues. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't the asshole. The wrongdoer is Jeff for the way he handled the gift. The author is trying to do the right thing by addressing it. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
