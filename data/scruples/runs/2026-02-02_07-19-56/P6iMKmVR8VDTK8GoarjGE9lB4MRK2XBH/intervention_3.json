Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA question) is in the wrong. The scenario involves Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author's friend. \n\nSo, the key points are: Liz got Jeff Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author had a copy already and offered to use that so Jeff could get familiar. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and chose Smash instead. Then when he got the gift, he was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game. The author wants to explain to Jeff that his actions were hurtful to Liz.\n\nFirst, the author's role here. They were present during the events and might have an opinion. But are they the one in the wrong? The author isn't the one who returned the gift; that was Jeff. The author's question is about whether they should confront Jeff about his behavior. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not accurate.\n\nJeff's actions were the problem. He returned the gift Liz got him, which was hurtful. The author is considering intervening, which could be seen as a friend trying to help. The user's question is if the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's mistake. But the author isn't the one who did the hurtful act. The problem is Jeff's actions, not the author's. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to mediate or help their friend realize his mistake, which isn't inherently wrong.\n"
