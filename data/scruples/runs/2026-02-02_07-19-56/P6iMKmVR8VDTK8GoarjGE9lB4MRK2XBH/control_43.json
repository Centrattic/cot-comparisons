Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author (the person asking the question) had a copy already and suggested using it so Jeff could get familiar with the game. Then, on his birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff seemed unimpressed and later returned it to get Let's Go Eevee. This upset Liz, who was holding back tears.\n\nThe author wants to tell Jeff that returning the gift immediately in front of Liz was a bad move. The question is whether the author is the asshole for wanting to do that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to point out a social misstep. Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, and the author is concerned about their friend's behavior. Friends often give each other advice, especially when it comes to important relationships. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake and improve his relationship with Liz.\n\nJeff's actions do seem inconsiderate. Returning an unopened gift from a girlfriend on the same day, especially when she was already anxious about whether it was a good choice, is a big no-no. The author isn't making a judgment about the gift itself but about how Jeff handled it. The author's advice is meant to be constructive, not just criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should consider how they approach Jeff. It's one thing to want to help, but the way they do it matters. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain, not the method. The intent here is to point out hurtful behavior, which isn't the author's fault. The author isn't the one who caused the problem; they're trying to address it. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
