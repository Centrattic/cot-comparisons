Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend (Jeff) that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his 20th birthday. The author (let's call them the narrator) had a copy already and suggested using it before the gift was given. On the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. Then, after receiving the gift, Jeff seemed unimpressed. Later, he returned the gift to GameStop for another game, which upset Liz.\n\nSo the main issue is Jeff's reaction to the gift. The narrator is considering stepping in to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful. The question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, friends often give advice when they see someone acting in a way that could hurt others. The narrator is concerned about Jeff's behavior towards his girlfriend. Jeff returning the gift immediately and in front of Liz would likely hurt her feelings. The narrator wants to point out that Jeff's actions were poor, which is an attempt to help him realize the mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the narrator is overstepping. It's possible that Jeff's decision was his own, and the narrator shouldn't interfere. However, the key point here is that Liz was upset, and the narrator is trying to mediate or offer a perspective that Jeff might not have considered.\n\nConsidering the context, the narrator's intention is to help Jeff understand how his actions affected Liz. Friends often offer such advice, especially when they see a close friend making a mistake that could harm a relationship. Therefore, the narrator is likely not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
