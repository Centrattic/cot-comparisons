Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for planning to explain to Jeff that his handling of the birthday gift was poor. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, bought him Super Mario Party for his birthday. The author, who is a friend, had already offered to let Jeff play the game before the gift was given. On the birthday, Jeff initially didn't want to play Mario Party, so they played Smash instead. Then, when Liz gave him the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it in front of her for another game. The author is considering stepping in to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff's reaction to the gift was negative, he returned it in front of Liz, and the author wants to address this. The question is whether the author is wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, consider Jeff's actions. Bringing up the gift immediately after receiving it and then returning it in front of the giver is clearly hurtful. Liz was holding back tears, which shows she was upset. Jeff's rationale that he knew Liz was into Eevee is a bit dismissive of her effort to choose a gift he might like. Even if he didn't like it, his handling of the situation was poor.\n\nNow, the author's role. The author had initially helped by offering to let Jeff play the game before the gift, which was a kind gesture. But when Jeff reacted poorly, the author didn't intervene at the time. Now, the author is thinking of explaining to Jeff why his actions were wrong. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for doing that? The author's intention is to protect Liz's feelings and help Jeff understand his mistake. If the author had not spoken up before, maybe they should have, but since they're a close friend, it's reasonable to address the issue now. Jeff's actions were hurtful, and pointing that out could help him realize his error and prevent future issues. \n\nHowever, the author might be overstepping if they weren't asked to intervene. But given the context\u2014Jeff's friend being hurt and the author being present when the incident happened\u2014it's a valid concern. The author's motivation is to correct a friend's harmful behavior, which is a good reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as taking sides, but since Liz is upset and Jeff's actions were inconsiderate, it's more about supporting a friend who was hurt. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's poor handling of the situation. They're trying to address a mistake that was made in front of someone who was clearly upset. Jeff's actions were the issue here, not the author's intention to help Liz and Jeff understand that.\n"
