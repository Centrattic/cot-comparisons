Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author's friend. The main issue is Jeff returning a birthday gift Liz gave him, and the author wants to explain that Jeff handled it poorly.\n\nFirst, the context: Liz asked the author if Super Mario Party would be a good gift, and the author suggested using their own copy so Jeff could get familiar with it. Then on Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it to get Let's Go Eevee. The author is considering confronting Jeff about this.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they explain to Jeff that his actions were poor. \n\nThe key points here are: Jeff returned the gift immediately, in front of Liz, and then rationalized it by saying he thought Liz would like Eevee more. But Liz had already put effort into getting Mario Party, and Jeff's actions might have hurt her feelings. \n\nThe author is trying to help Jeff see that returning the gift so quickly, especially without considering Liz's feelings, was not the best approach. The author isn't directly involved in the gift-giving but is a friend who observed the situation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered rude to return a gift immediately, especially if it's done in a way that makes the giver feel undervalued. Jeff's actions seem insensitive, and the author is trying to help him understand that. The author isn't the one who returned the gift, so their intention is to correct Jeff's behavior, not take sides. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to mediate a situation where their friend made a mistake. The main issue is Jeff's behavior, not the author's. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize the impact of his actions on Liz. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
