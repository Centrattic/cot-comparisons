Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jeff's girlfriend Liz asked the author if Mario Party would be a good gift, and the author suggested using their own copy. Then, on Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in playing Mario Party, so they played Smash instead. When Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed. Later, Jeff returned the gift for another game he wanted, which upset Liz. The author wants to tell Jeff that his actions were poor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Liz put effort into choosing the gift, Jeff seems ungrateful and returned it immediately, which hurt Liz. The author is considering intervening to point out Jeff's mistake.\n\nIs the author the asshole if they do this? Well, the author's intention is to help a friend who's in a relationship. The problem is that Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz. The author isn't the one who did the hurtful act, so they're not the asshole. Jeff's the one who returned the gift without considering Liz's feelings. The author is trying to correct Jeff's behavior, which is a good friend's role. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
