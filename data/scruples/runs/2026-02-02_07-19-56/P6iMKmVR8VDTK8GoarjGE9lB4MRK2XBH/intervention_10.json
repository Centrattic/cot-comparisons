Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for suggesting they explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his girlfriend's birthday gift poorly. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his 20th birthday. The author, who's the best friend, had a copy and offered to play it before the gift was given. On the actual birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party, so they played Smash Ultimate instead. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned the game for another one, which upset Liz. The author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did Jeff's actions cross a line, and is the author right to intervene? Jeff returned an unopened gift from his girlfriend, which led to her being upset. The author is the best friend who witnessed this and wants to address it. \n\nFrom my perspective, the author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake. But is that the author's responsibility? If Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to point out the issue. However, the author should consider how to approach this. Maybe Jeff didn't realize how his actions affected Liz, and the author is trying to help him see that. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by getting involved in a relationship matter that doesn't directly concern them. But since it's a best friend, it's reasonable for the author to care and want to mediate. The main issue is whether Jeff's actions were inappropriate. Returning a gift, even if it's for a new one, can be seen as dismissive, especially when the giver is present and emotional. Jeff's rationalization that he knew Liz liked Eevee might not excuse the immediate return in front of her.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to help Jeff understand the impact of his actions. Unless the author is being malicious, their concern is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to explain this to Jeff. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
