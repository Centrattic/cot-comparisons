Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend Jeff and his girlfriend Liz. \n\nSo, the author helped by offering their own copy of the game Mario Party to Jeff before his birthday. Then, on his birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and chose Smash Ultimate instead. Later, when Liz gave him the Mario Party as a gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and returned it for a different game, which upset Liz. The author is considering if they should explain to Jeff that his actions were poor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is Jeff's reaction to the gift. Gifts are supposed to show thoughtfulness and effort. Jeff returned the gift immediately after receiving it, which could be hurtful to Liz, especially if she put effort into choosing it. The author might think Jeff was wrong for doing that, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain this to Jeff.\n\nThe author's role: They offered their own copy beforehand, which might have set up expectations. However, even if Jeff had played the game before, the fact that he returned the gift Liz bought could be seen as dismissive. The author is now considering intervening, which is a kind gesture, but maybe they should have addressed it earlier or handled it differently.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's actions? If the author's intention is to help a friend see that their actions were hurtful, that's usually a good thing. But maybe the author should have spoken up at the time instead of after the fact. However, since the situation was emotionally charged and Liz was upset, the author might have chosen the right time to talk to Jeff. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author shouldn't meddle if Jeff's actions were his own choice, even if it's poor. But given that it's a best friend and the girlfriend is hurt, stepping in could be justified. The author isn't the one who returned the gift, so they aren't directly in the wrong. Their intention is to explain the situation to Jeff, which could be seen as supportive of Liz and helping Jeff realize his mistake.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help a friend who made a mistake, not causing the problem themselves. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
