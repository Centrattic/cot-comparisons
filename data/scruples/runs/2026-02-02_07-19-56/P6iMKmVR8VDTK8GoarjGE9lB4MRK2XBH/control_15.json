Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original WIBTA) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author (who is Jeff's best friend). \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Jeff received a gift from Liz for his birthday, which is a Mario Party game. The author had already let Jeff play it before the birthday because he had a copy. On the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party, so they ended up playing Smash instead. Then, after Liz gave the gift, Jeff seemed unimpressed and later returned the gift for another game, making Liz upset. The author is considering explaining to Jeff that his actions were hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are: Jeff returned the gift in front of Liz, which upset her, and the author wants to confront him about it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to point out Jeff's mistake to prevent further hurt to Liz. The author is Jeff's best friend, so they have a close relationship. The author might be trying to help Jeff realize that his actions were hurtful, especially since Liz was already anxious about the gift before the birthday.\n\nJeff's actions: He returned the gift immediately, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if the game was something he wasn't interested in, returning it right after receiving it might be unkind. The author is stepping in to address this, which is a form of conflict resolution or support for Liz. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author's approach is constructive and aims to help Jeff understand his mistake, then no. However, if the author is being confrontational or accusatory without considering Jeff's feelings, maybe. But in this case, the author is trying to explain that Jeff's actions were hurtful, which seems reasonable. The author isn't taking sides but pointing out the impact of Jeff's actions. \n\nJeff's behavior is the issue here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by addressing it. The author is being a supportive friend to both Jeff and Liz. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
