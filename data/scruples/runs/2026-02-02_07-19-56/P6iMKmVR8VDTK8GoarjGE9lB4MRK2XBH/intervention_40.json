Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend that he handled his birthday gift poorly. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author if the Mario Party game was a good gift. The author had a copy and offered to play it before the birthday so Jeff could be familiar. Then on the birthday, when the author suggested Mario Party, Jeff wanted to play Smash instead. After the game, Jeff received Mario Party but was unimpressed and later returned it for another game. The author plans to tell Jeff that his actions hurt Liz's feelings.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to think again. The key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by planning to confront Jeff? Let's see.\n\nThe author's actions: They offered to let Jeff try the game before, which was considerate. On the birthday, Jeff's own choice was Smash, so the author didn't push Mario Party. Then Jeff received the gift and was underwhelmed. He returned it right away, which made Liz upset. The author, who was there, plans to explain that Jeff's behavior was hurtful.\n\nIs the author the asshole here? Well, the author is a friend who is trying to be honest with Jeff about his actions. The problem is whether the author's intention to confront Jeff is wrong. Since the author's goal is to point out Jeff's poor handling of the gift, not to take sides or cause trouble, maybe it's justified. Jeff's actions were inconsiderate, especially in front of Liz. The author's advice might help Jeff realize his mistake.\n\nBut maybe the author is overstepping? However, since the author is Jeff's best friend and was present, it's reasonable to offer feedback. The alternative is letting Jeff remain unaware of how his actions affected Liz, which isn't helpful. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to explain this. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
