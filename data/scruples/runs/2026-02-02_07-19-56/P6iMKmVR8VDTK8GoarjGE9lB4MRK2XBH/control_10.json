Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend named Jeff who received a video game from his girlfriend Liz for his birthday. The author, who is Jeff's best friend, is considering whether to explain to Jeff that he handled the gift poorly. \n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. Liz asked the author if the Mario Party game would be a good gift, and the author even offered their own copy so Jeff could try it before the birthday. On the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game, which upset Liz. The author is thinking of telling Jeff that returning the gift in front of Liz was wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they explain this to Jeff. The key here is whether the author has the right to intervene in their friend's relationship. Since the author is Jeff's best friend, they might feel it's their duty to help. However, Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, and the author's intention is to correct Jeff's behavior. \n\nBut is the author overstepping? Jeff might feel that his friend is interfering in his relationship decisions. On the other hand, the author's motivation is to prevent further hurt to Liz, which is a valid concern. The author isn't trying to take sides but to point out a potentially harmful action. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author's advice is well-meaning and appropriate. Since Jeff's actions were impulsive and hurtful, the author acting as a mediator could be justified, especially since the author was involved and witnessed the events. However, the author should consider Jeff's perspective too. Maybe Jeff didn't realize the impact of his actions, and the author's advice could help him understand. \n\nBut the author's advice might come off as judgmental. The key is how the author approaches it. If the explanation is done in a supportive way, it might be helpful. However, if it's done in a way that makes Jeff feel attacked, that could be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving this advice. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything directly harmful. They're trying to help a friend who may have made a mistake. So, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They are acting as a concerned friend to prevent further issues in the relationship. Jeff's actions were the problematic ones, not the author's intention to advise him.\n"
