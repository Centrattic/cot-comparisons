Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author, who is Jeff's best friend, is in the wrong if they explain to Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. The situation involves Jeff receiving Mario Party from his girlfriend Liz, then later returning it for another game, which upset Liz.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. Jeff got the game, was initially underwhelmed. Then, during the mall trip, he returned the unopened gift for another game. Liz was upset because she had given him Mario Party as a gift. The author is considering whether they should confront Jeff about this.\n\nThe user is asking if the author would be the asshole (WIBTA) for explaining Jeff's poor handling of the gift. The answer options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, author not wrong).\n\nSo, the author is a friend who is concerned about Jeff's actions affecting Liz. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake. But maybe there's a problem with how the author approaches Jeff. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not Jeff.\n\nJeff's actions: returning the gift immediately without considering Liz's feelings. The author's action is to explain that this was wrong. The author is trying to mediate or advise a friend, which is a common role for a best friend. \n\nPossible angles: Is it the author's place to intervene? Could the author be overstepping? But since they're best friends and the action hurt Liz, maybe the author has a right to speak up. \n\nAnother point: Jeff's behavior was hurtful to Liz, and the author, being there during the mall trip, saw the situation. The author might feel responsible as a friend to correct Jeff's behavior.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They are trying to help a friend realize a mistake that hurt their partner. So the answer would be B.\n"
