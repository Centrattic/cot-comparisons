Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, got him Super Mario Party for his 20th birthday. She asked the author (and maybe others) if it was a good gift. The author had their own copy and offered to play it first so Jeff could be familiar with the game. On the birthday, Jeff wasn't interested in playing Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. Then, after receiving the gift, Jeff seemed underwhelmed and later returned the gift to GameStop for another game, Let's Go Eevee, in front of Liz, who was upset. Jeff rationalized this by saying he knew Liz liked Eevee and they wouldn't appreciate Mario Party.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were hurtful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain this.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider the dynamics. The main issue here is Jeff's behavior towards Liz. Returning a gift immediately, especially in front of the giver, is generally considered rude. Jeff's actions could be hurtful to Liz, and the author is thinking of stepping in to help their friend realize his mistake.\n\nIs the author right to intervene? Well, as a friend, it's common to want to correct a friend's potentially hurtful behavior. However, the author needs to approach this carefully. But the key point here is whether the author is the asshole for wanting to explain. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake, not to belittle him. So, the author isn't the one in the wrong here. Jeff's actions are problematic, and the author's intervention is an attempt to correct that. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
