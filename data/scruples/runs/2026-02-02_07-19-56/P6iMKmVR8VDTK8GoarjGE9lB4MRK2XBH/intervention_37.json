Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for trying to explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift poorly. The situation is that Jeff's girlfriend Liz bought him Super Mario Party for his birthday, which he returned right away for another game. The author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was present when Jeff received the gift, and Jeff immediately returned it in front of Liz, causing her to be upset. The author wants to explain to Jeff that this was a bad move. The user is saying they think the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nThe user is suggesting that the author might be in the wrong. But wait, the author is the one who is considering giving Jeff feedback, not Jeff himself. The original scenario is from the author's perspective, asking if they would be the asshole for explaining Jeff's mistake.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by pointing out Jeff's behavior. To determine that, I need to consider the context. The author is a best friend, and they were present during the incident. They might feel Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz, and they want to help him see that. \n\nBut is the author overstepping? Well, as a friend, it's common to offer advice when someone's actions might hurt others. The key is whether the author's intention is to help and whether their approach is respectful. The author isn't attacking Jeff but trying to explain the impact of his actions. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author shouldn't meddle, but given that they were part of the situation and saw Liz's reaction, it's understandable they want to address it. Jeff's actions were abrupt and ungrateful, which could damage his relationship with Liz. The author's intervention might help prevent future issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to support their friend and Liz by pointing out a mistake. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
