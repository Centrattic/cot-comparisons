Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Jeff's birthday and how he handled the gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author is a friend who drove 250 miles to visit Jeff. Before leaving, Liz had asked the author if the Mario Party game would be a good gift, and the author suggested using their own copy so Jeff could get familiar with it.\n\nOn the birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party, even though the author had offered the game. He wanted to play Smash Ultimate instead. The author and Liz went along with that to avoid an argument. Then, when Liz gave the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and said it wasn't what he hoped for. After that, Jeff took the game to GameStop right away, and Liz was upset. The author is considering telling Jeff he was wrong to return the gift in front of Liz.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong if they explain Jeff's poor handling of the gift? The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of all parties involved. Let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. **Liz's Intent:** Liz bought the game as a gift, possibly after asking the author if it would be good. She might have chosen it based on Jeff's interests or the author's suggestion. The act of giving a gift is a personal gesture, and the recipient's reaction is crucial here.\n\n2. **Jeff's Reaction to the Gift:** Jeff was underwhelmed and said it wasn't what he was hoping for. This is the first issue. Gifts are a way to show thoughtfulness and love, so the way Jeff reacted might be hurtful to Liz, even if he's being honest. The problem is not just the gift itself but how he received it. \n\n3. **Returning the Gift in Front of Liz:** Jeff went to GameStop right after receiving the gift, and Liz noticed and was upset. Returning a gift, especially a new one, can be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the giver's effort. Doing it in front of the giver compounds the issue because it lacks sensitivity and could make Liz feel unappreciated.\n\n4. **Rationalizing the Return:** Jeff tried to justify it by saying he knew Liz preferred Eevee and that Mario Party wouldn't be appreciated. While this might sound like an excuse, it's possible he really thought she liked that game more. However, the way he handled it was not considerate. He could have waited to talk to Liz about it, maybe even thanked her first and then discussed the return privately.\n\n5. **The Author's Role:** The author was present when Jeff received the gift and when he returned it. The author is now considering confronting Jeff about his behavior. The key here is whether the author's intention to explain is justified. Since the author is a close friend, pointing out Jeff's actions might be seen as trying to help, but the method and tone could affect the outcome.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's poor handling of the gift? The author's actions were in good faith\u2014offering to play the game to help Jeff get familiar with it. But when Jeff received the gift, the author didn't stop him from being underwhelmed or from returning the gift immediately. However, the author is now thinking about addressing this with Jeff, which is the main point of contention.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because the author didn't stop Jeff from returning the gift right then or support Liz more. Alternatively, maybe the user thinks the author has the right to point out the mistake since they were involved.\n\nFrom a typical \"would I be the asshole\" perspective, the key is intent and the impact. The author's intent is to help Jeff recognize his mistake in handling the gift, which might be a good intention. However, the author might have overstepped by directly confronting Jeff about it, especially if the author played a role in suggesting the game in the first place. Wait, the author did offer their own copy to help Jeff get familiar with the game. So Liz bought the game based on that, and Jeff ended up not liking it, leading him to return it. The author's suggestion might have influenced the gift choice, so there's a potential conflict of interest. If Jeff returned the game because he had already played it, then the author's initial action might have made the gift less meaningful. That's a point to consider.\n\nAlso, the author didn't speak up when Jeff was underwhelmed by the gift or when he decided to return it immediately. The author could have supported Liz by saying the game was a great choice or at least advised Jeff to handle the return more sensitively. Instead, the author waited until later to confront Jeff, which might be seen as not standing up for Liz when she needed support.\n\nThe main issue is Jeff's actions, not the author's. The author is now trying to address the problem, but whether that makes them an asshole depends on how they approach it. If the author is being honest and trying to help Jeff, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are being critical or insensitive in their explanation, that could be problematic. The scenario doesn't mention the author's method of explanation, so we have to assume it's in a constructive way.\n\nIn typical WIBTA scenarios, the person being asked (the author) is the one who might be the asshole if their action is the problem. But in this case, the author is considering intervening after the fact. The initial problem was Jeff's behavior. The author's action is to point out Jeff's mistake, which could be seen as trying to help, so the author might not be the asshole. However, if the author contributed to the problem by suggesting the game, they might share some blame. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to explain Jeff's poor handling. The author's suggestion was to make the gift more useful if Jeff received it. The problem is Jeff's reaction and immediate return. The author's intervention could be seen as trying to mediate a friend's mistake, which is a valid action. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are trying to correct Jeff's behavior, which was the actual issue. However, if the author's actions led to Liz's gift being less impactful, maybe A. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the author forced Liz to buy the game; she did it on her own, even though the author had a copy. The author might have given advice but didn't pressure her. \n\nSo the main fault is Jeff's for handling the gift poorly, not the author's for pointing it out. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
