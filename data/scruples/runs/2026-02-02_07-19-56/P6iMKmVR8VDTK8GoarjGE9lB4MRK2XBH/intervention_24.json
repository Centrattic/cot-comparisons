Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author's friend.\n\nFirst, the setup: Liz buys Mario Party for Jeff's birthday. The author had a copy, so suggested using it. On the birthday, Jeff chose to play Smash instead. Then, after receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and returned it to get another game. The author now wants to confront Jeff about this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to analyze from both sides. Let's look at the key points.\n\nLiz asked if the gift would be good, and the author offered to play with their copy so Jeff would know. That seems okay. But Jeff didn't like the gift and returned it immediately. The author wants to explain that Jeff's actions were poor.\n\nIs the author right to intervene? Well, Jeff's actions were hurtful to Liz. Returning a gift on the same day, especially to a girlfriend, can be seen as dismissive. However, the author's role here is as a friend. The question is whether the author should step in to correct Jeff's behavior.\n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The author isn't the one who returned the gift; Jeff did. The author's intention is to help Jeff understand his mistake. Unless the author had prior knowledge that Jeff would dislike the gift, their involvement in suggesting using their own copy might have influenced Jeff's expectations. But the main issue is Jeff's reaction, not the author's initial suggestion.\n\nWait, when Liz asked if the gift would be good, the author offered to play with their copy. That might have set up an expectation that the game was something they could do together, but Jeff still chose to play Smash instead. Then, when he got the gift, he was underwhelmed. The author's suggestion might not be the root of the problem. The problem is Jeff's reaction and the way he handled the gift.\n\nSo, the author wants to explain that Jeff's handling was poor. The author isn't directly at fault here. Jeff made the decision to return the gift. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize his mistake. Unless the author had a role in encouraging Jeff to return the gift, which they didn't. The author is the one who tried to help Liz by offering their own game. So, the author isn't the asshole here. They're trying to mediate or help Jeff understand his actions affected Liz. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
