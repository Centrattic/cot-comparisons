Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's friend, Jeff, got a gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author had a copy of the game already and offered to use his to let Liz test it before giving Jeff the actual one. Then on Jeff's birthday, he wasn't interested in the game and instead wanted to play Smash. After receiving the gift, Jeff was underwhelmed and later returned it for another game in front of Liz, making her upset. The author wants to explain to Jeff that this was a poor move.\n\nSo the question is, is the author (WIBTA) the asshole if they explain this to Jeff? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me think about the key points here. Jeff returned the gift in front of Liz, which hurt her feelings. The author is trying to point out that this was a bad decision. But why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe if they're prying or not respecting Jeff's privacy? Or if the author wasn't part of the situation enough to comment.\n\nBut wait, the author was present during the whole event. They were at the mall when Jeff returned the game. They witnessed Liz's reaction. The author might be motivated by concern for Liz and Jeff's relationship. However, Jeff is the one who made the decision to return the gift. The author's intention is to explain that Jeff handled it poorly. \n\nIs there any reason the author would be in the wrong? If Jeff didn't ask for the author's opinion, maybe the author is overstepping. But if Jeff's actions were hurtful, perhaps the author has a valid reason to speak up. Also, the author was a close friend, so maybe it's their responsibility to help Jeff see his mistake.\n\nAnother angle: Jeff's reaction to the gift. He was underwhelmed, but the author used their own copy to test it. Maybe Jeff felt the gift wasn't thoughtful because he already had the game. But Liz was trying to get him a copy, not knowing the author had one. So Jeff returning it might have been a hasty decision. The author, knowing that Liz was trying to be nice, wants to help Jeff realize that.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends do correct each other when they see a mistake, especially if it affects their friends' relationships. So the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. Unless the author is being judgmental without understanding, but the scenario suggests the author is trying to help Jeff see his error.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to help Jeff understand his mistake, which could prevent future issues with Liz.\n"
