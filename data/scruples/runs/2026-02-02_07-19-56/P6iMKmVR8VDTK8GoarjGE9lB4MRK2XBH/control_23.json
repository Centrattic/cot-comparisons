Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be An Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves Jeff, his girlfriend Liz, and the author.\n\nSo, here's the setup: Jeff's girlfriend, Liz, asked the author if a Mario Party gift for Jeff was good. The author had a copy and offered to let Jeff try it before the birthday. On Jeff's birthday, he was uninterested in playing Mario Party when suggested and chose Smash instead. Then, after receiving the Mario Party as a gift, Jeff was underwhelmed, returned it to GameStop right away for another game, which upset Liz. The author is considering confronting Jeff about this.\n\nThe key points here are about Jeff's behavior. The author is thinking of explaining to Jeff that his actions were poor. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, Jeff's actions seem questionable. He received a gift from his girlfriend, returned it immediately, and went for another game he wanted, which he knew she liked. That's pretty inconsiderate. The author helped by suggesting trying the game before the gift, but Jeff still returned it. The author is now considering addressing this, which might be seen as a good deed, intervening to help a friend realize a mistake.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. Since Jeff's actions were rude and the author is trying to correct that, the author is likely not the asshole. The answer should be B, No.\n"
