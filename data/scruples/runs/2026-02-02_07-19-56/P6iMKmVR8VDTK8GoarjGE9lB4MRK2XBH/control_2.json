Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves Jeff's birthday and his reaction to the gift from his girlfriend, Liz. The author is asking if they're the asshole (WIBTA) for explaining to Jeff that he handled the gift poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. Jeff got Super Mario Party for his birthday. Before the birthday, the author had already used his copy, so Liz used her own copy. On the birthday, Jeff didn't like the game and wanted to play Smash instead. Then, after receiving the gift, he was underwhelmed. Later, he returned the gift for another game, which upset Liz. The author is considering talking to Jeff about his behavior.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to step in. The key points here are Jeff's actions towards Liz. Returning a gift immediately, especially when the giver is present and upset, is generally considered rude. Jeff's excuse that he knew Liz liked Eevee might not justify returning the gift without considering her feelings. \n\nThe author is a friend who witnessed this and wants to help Jeff realize his mistake. Friends often give advice, especially when they see someone hurting others. However, if Jeff's actions were inconsiderate, the author isn't the asshole for pointing that out. The author isn't the one who returned the gift or hurt Liz; Jeff did. The author's intention here is to correct Jeff's behavior, which could be seen as the right thing to do. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. Did the author have the right to intervene? Since they're best friends, the author might feel it's their responsibility. However, is Jeff's reaction justified? If he genuinely didn't like the gift and wanted to exchange it, but did so in a way that hurt Liz, that's on him. The author's advice would help him see that his method was poor, not the act of exchanging the gift. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help a friend who acted inconsiderately. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
