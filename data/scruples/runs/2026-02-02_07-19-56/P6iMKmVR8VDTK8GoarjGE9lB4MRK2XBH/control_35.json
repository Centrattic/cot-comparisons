Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they explain to their friend Jeff that he handled his birthday gift from his girlfriend Liz poorly. \n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation. Jeff got a gift from Liz, which was Super Mario Party for the Switch. The author had already offered to let Liz use their copy so Jeff could be familiar with the game. Then, on his birthday, Jeff didn't want to play Mario Party and instead chose Smash Ultimate. When he received the gift, he was underwhelmed and said it wasn't what he wanted. Later, Jeff returned the unopened game for another one, Let's Go Eevee, right in front of Liz, who was upset.\n\nThe author is considering telling Jeff that his actions were hurtful to Liz. The question is whether the author would be the asshole if they did that.\n\nLooking at the details: Jeff returned the gift immediately, which could be seen as dismissive. Liz was already worried about the gift being good, and Jeff's reaction might have made her feel unappreciated. The author's intention is to help Jeff realize he was wrong, which is a good motive. However, the author might be overstepping if they didn't consider Jeff's feelings or if Jeff might not want feedback.\n\nBut Jeff's actions were indeed hurtful, and the author is trying to mediate a friendship issue. Friends often give each other honest feedback. Jeff's return of the gift without considering Liz's feelings is the main problem here. The author isn't directly involved in the conflict but is trying to help their friend avoid hurting Liz further. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to point out Jeff's mistake. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
