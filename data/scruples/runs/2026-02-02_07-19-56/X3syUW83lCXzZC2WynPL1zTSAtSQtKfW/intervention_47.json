Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's upset that his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. He does childcare duties on those days, including taking care of the kids after work and on weekends. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other activities. The husband feels annoyed because he doesn't want to leave the kids with her when she's available, as family time is rare for him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband is taking care of the kids alone on multiple nights, which is a lot of responsibility. He's not asking for help; he's saying he doesn't want to leave the kids with the wife when she's available. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which she needs for her well-being. The husband's stance is that he's just not interested in going out, wanting to spend time with the family when they're together.\n\nNow, considering fairness in a relationship. Both partners should have needs and boundaries. The wife's activities are for her mental health, which is important. The husband's need for family time is also valid. However, expecting the wife to always stay home and take care of the kids when he's available might be unfair to her. On the other hand, the husband is handling the childcare on most nights, which is a big contribution.\n\nBut the issue is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset that the wife leaves him alone. The key here is communication and mutual support. If the wife is doing her part by taking care of the kids when she's home and the husband is handling the rest, then maybe it's balanced. However, the husband is not offering to share the responsibility more equally. He's not suggesting they find a middle ground or take turns. Instead, he's expressing annoyance without offering to adjust his own availability for some nights. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he's not going out because he wants to be with the family, but that's a personal choice. However, expecting the wife to stay home and take care of the kids just because he wants family time might be placing his needs above hers. Relationships require compromise. If the wife is contributing in other ways (like teaching and dancing for her well-being), maybe the husband should consider that. However, the childcare duties are on him most nights, which is a lot. \n\nBut the main point is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not communicating his needs effectively, or if he's not recognizing her needs, that could make him the asshole. Alternatively, if the wife isn't acknowledging his efforts and the burden he's taking on, she might be at fault. The husband is seeking a reality check, which shows he's aware of the situation, but his stance is that he doesn't want to go out, so he's not willing to adjust. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners should have some personal time. The wife has hers, and the husband wants family time. However, expecting her to always stay home when he's available could be seen as not respecting her need for personal space and activities. The husband might be in the wrong because he's not considering her needs and is imposing his own without compromise. \n\nBut also, the husband is handling a lot of childcare duties, which is a big task. If the wife is doing her part when she's available, maybe it's balanced. However, the husband's annoyance stems from the fact that he's handling it alone, but he's not suggesting any solution. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the husband is being unreasonable in expecting the wife to stay home when she has her own needs. Given that the wife has her activities for her well-being, and the husband is not offering to adjust his own schedule (like going out sometimes), the husband might be in the wrong for not being flexible and not recognizing her needs.\n"
