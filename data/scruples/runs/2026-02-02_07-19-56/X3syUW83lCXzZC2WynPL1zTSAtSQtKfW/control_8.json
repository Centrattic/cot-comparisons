Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband is upset because his wife is away 2-4 nights a week, leaving him alone with the kids. He takes care of the kids every day, including on Fridays when the kids stay home with him instead of daycare. He's not opposed to her dancing or her other activities, but he's frustrated that he's handling all the childcare alone. The wife suggests he could go out a few nights, but he doesn't want to because he values family time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main point is that he's carrying the load of childcare when his wife is away. He does appreciate her dancing for her well-being but is feeling overwhelmed. The wife's side, according to the story, is that she's been dancing since she was five, and she teaches on Saturdays. She's suggesting that the husband could go out himself, but he doesn't want to because he wants to be with the kids.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to feel like he's shouldering all the childcare duties? Well, in a partnership, it's common for both parents to share responsibilities. However, the wife is working full-time as well, and the daycare is during the day. So the husband's time with the kids is mostly evenings and weekends. The wife is away a few nights, but the husband is also working during the week. The key issue seems to be the division of childcare duties in the evenings and weekends.\n\nThe wife's suggestion that the husband could go out a few nights might imply that she expects some balance. But the husband doesn't want to go out because he wants family time. That's a valid preference, but it might mean he's not taking the opportunity to have his own time. However, if the husband is not interested in going out, maybe the wife needs to adjust her schedule or find another way to support him.\n\nAnother angle is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking his wife to stop dancing or anything; he's just expressing that he's handling the childcare alone. It's possible that the wife's activities are necessary for her mental health, which is also important in a relationship. The husband might need to communicate his feelings better or ask for help rather than just feeling annoyed.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing annoyance, not making a demand. He's not refusing to help or being unkind. He's trying to balance his own need for family time with his wife's activities. If the wife is okay with the current arrangement and the husband is just frustrated, it might not be the husband's fault. However, if the husband's work and childcare responsibilities are causing him stress, he might need to discuss with his wife about shared responsibilities or support.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's common for parents to have differing contributions based on their schedules and preferences. But in this case, the husband is doing a lot without the support of his wife. The wife's suggestion that he could go out implies that she's not willing to reduce her own time away. So maybe the husband's feelings are valid, and it's not entirely his fault. Alternatively, the husband could be more proactive in finding solutions, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about what he should do next.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing a valid concern about the imbalance in childcare responsibilities, not refusing to contribute or being unreasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
