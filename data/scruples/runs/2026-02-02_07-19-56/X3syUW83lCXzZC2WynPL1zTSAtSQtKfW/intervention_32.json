Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's reasonable for the husband to be upset that his wife is leaving him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays, which she's done since she was young. That's part of her mental and emotional well-being. The husband handles the kids on those nights and weekends. Then there's 1-2 more nights where she has work meetings, friends' dinners, etc. So total 3-4 nights a week he's alone with the kids. He doesn't want to go out because he enjoys family time when they are all together. \n\nThe husband is asking if he's the asshole for being annoyed. His side is that he's taking care of the kids and not getting his own time. The wife's side is that she has her hobbies and needs, and she's offering that he could go out, but he doesn't want to. \n\nSo, from the wife's perspective, she's maintaining her hobbies and social life, which are important for her well-being. The husband is handling the childcare, which is a lot. But he doesn't want to use that time to go out, preferring family time. Is that reasonable? Well, if he's not interested in going out, then it's not his fault he doesn't want to. But the issue is whether he's being unfair by expecting her to stay home more. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is contributing in her own way by taking care of the kids during the day when they're in daycare and when she's working. The husband has a day off on Fridays, which he uses to take care of the kids. So maybe the workload is split, but the problem is the nights when she's out. \n\nIs it fair for the husband to be upset that she's not home those nights? Well, part of being in a relationship is balancing individual needs with the family's needs. The wife's dancing and social activities are part of her personal time, which is important. If the husband is okay with handling the kids when she's out, then maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's feeling overburdened, he should communicate that. \n\nBut the key point is that the wife is already doing her part during the day and on some days, and the husband is taking on the evenings and weekends. If he's not overburdened during the day, maybe the issue is more about his personal desire for time rather than a real lack of support. Also, he acknowledges that he's handling the kids and even appreciates her need to dance. So maybe his annoyance isn't because of the workload but because he wants her to be home more for family time, which is a valid desire. \n\nHowever, if the wife is already contributing in other ways and he's not interested in using the time to go out, then it's not necessarily his fault. The problem might be that he's expecting her to adjust her schedule to meet his preference when she has her own needs. So, perhaps he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her need to have personal time, even though he's handling the childcare. Alternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's expressing a valid need for family time. \n\nThe question is whether his annoyance is unreasonable. Since the wife is already giving up her time during the day and he's not being asked to do more than he's already doing, maybe the husband's annoyance is about wanting her presence more than necessary. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings, but the wife is also within her rights to have her personal time. However, if the husband is actually overburdened, that's a different story. But from the description, he seems to handle it and even appreciates her dancing. So maybe he's not the asshole here. But the initial thought was that he is in the wrong, but upon analysis, it's a balance. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. Because he's not refusing to help, but expressing a desire for more family time. The wife is doing her part, and the husband is just wanting her to be home more, which is a reasonable request if it's causing him stress. Wait, but he says he's not annoyed about the workload but about being alone with the kids. Maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem is if he's resenting her for her personal time, which is a common relationship issue. But since he appreciates her dancing, it's more about wanting her presence. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
