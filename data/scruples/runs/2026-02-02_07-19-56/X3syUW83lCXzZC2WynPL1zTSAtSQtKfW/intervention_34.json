Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has 1-2 other nights where she's out for work or friends. That totals 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. The husband doesn't want to go out because he wants family time when they're all together.\n\nThe husband feels annoyed because he's handling all the childcare alone those nights. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. He's asking if he's the asshole here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The wife has her own activities for her well-being, which is important. The husband is taking care of the kids, which is a lot of work, especially with a baby and a toddler. He's not upset about her needing time for herself, but he's frustrated about being alone with the kids those nights. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect her to stay home more? Well, they both work full-time. The wife's dancing and teaching are hobbies and part-time work? Maybe they balance responsibilities, but the husband is feeling overwhelmed. However, he's not asking her to stop her activities, just expressing annoyance. \n\nThe key point is whether he's unreasonable for not wanting to be alone with the kids. If he's okay with her going out but just wants her to take the kids sometimes, maybe there's a compromise needed. But he's not suggesting that; he's just not interested in going out. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that he could go out, but he doesn't want to. So maybe the issue is communication. The husband is focusing on his own feelings without considering that the wife might need her time. But he's also contributing a lot by taking care of the kids on Fridays. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong. He's expressing his feelings about the situation, and it's valid to feel overwhelmed. However, he needs to address it with his wife to find a solution. Since he's planning to talk to her, maybe there's a way to adjust schedules or share responsibilities more. The wife's activities are important for her mental health, so it's a balance. \n\nBut is he the asshole? Probably not. He's not asking her to stop her activities, just expressing his feelings. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not being selfish; he's trying to communicate his needs. However, some might argue that his wife's activities are necessary, and he should support her. But given the context, he's not unreasonable. So I think B is the answer.\n"
