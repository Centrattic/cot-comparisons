Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, the author's situation: they have two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other activities like work events or friends. The husband takes care of the kids on those nights and also has the kids all day on Fridays. He's not asking her to stop her activities but is asking if it's wrong to feel annoyed that he's left alone with the kids so often.\n\nThe key points here are about balance and mutual needs. The husband is handling a lot of childcare responsibilities, which can be exhausting. The wife has her own hobbies and social life, which are important for her well-being. The husband mentions he doesn't want to go out because he values family time, which is understandable. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners should have their needs met. If the wife is doing activities that are important to her and the husband is handling childcare, maybe there's a lack of shared responsibility. But the husband isn't asking her to stop; he's just expressing that he's annoyed when she leaves him alone. \n\nThe question is whether his feelings are valid. Since he's managing a significant amount of childcare on his own, it's reasonable for him to feel overwhelmed. The wife might need to consider that and perhaps adjust her schedule or find a way to share responsibilities more evenly. However, the husband isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. He's not being selfish; he's expressing a need for support. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners need time for themselves. The fact that the wife offers for him to go out but he doesn't want to shows that he's prioritizing family time, which is valid. The problem might be that the wife isn't acknowledging his need for support. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing a legitimate need and isn't overstepping by expecting his wife to stay more. The issue is more about the balance and communication between them rather than one being inherently wrong.\n"
