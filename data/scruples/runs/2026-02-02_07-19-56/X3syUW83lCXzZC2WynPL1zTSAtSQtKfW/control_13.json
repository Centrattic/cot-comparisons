Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturday, and has 1-2 other nights out. So total 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. The husband doesn't want to go out because he wants family time. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. \n\nSo the main question is whether the husband is wrong for being annoyed when his wife leaves him alone. Let's break it down. \n\nThe husband takes care of the kids on these nights and weekends. He's handling dinner, baths, bedtime, etc. That's a lot of work. He's not complaining about the dancing itself since he acknowledges it's important for her mental health. But the issue is the number of nights he's alone with the kids.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that he could go out, but he prefers family time. Maybe there's an expectation of equality in responsibilities. If she's doing her thing 3-4 nights, he's doing the bulk of childcare. But maybe the husband is feeling overwhelmed. However, he's not asking for help but rather expressing annoyance. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect his wife to not leave him so often? Well, the wife has her own needs and activities. The husband's not asking her to stop dancing, which is important to her. But the balance of childcare might be a problem. If the wife is going out, maybe he should be going out as well, but he doesn't want to. So there's a conflict in priorities. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing responsibilities is key. If one partner is handling the kids more, maybe there's an imbalance. But the husband's choice not to go out is valid. He wants family time. However, if the wife's activities are causing him to miss out on personal time, maybe they need to discuss how to split responsibilities better. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not asking for anything more than the current arrangement and is taking care of the kids, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's feeling resentful, that could be an issue. But the key is that he's not asking her to change her habits, just expressing annoyance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife should take on more of the childcare when she's home. If she's going out 3-4 nights, maybe when she's home, she should take the lead more. But the husband is handling the kids on those nights. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not refusing to help with the kids but is handling it himself. The wife's activities are balanced with his childcare duties, and he's not making unreasonable demands beyond what he's doing. The problem is the balance, but he's not the asshole for being annoyed. He's just expressing that he's handling the bulk of the childcare.\n"
