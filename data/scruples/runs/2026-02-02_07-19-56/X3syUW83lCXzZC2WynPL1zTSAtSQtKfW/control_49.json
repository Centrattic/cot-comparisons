Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two young children, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife has been dancing since she was 5, which she does two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. Both work full-time, with daycare during the day. The husband gets Fridays off, so he's with the kids that day. The wife also has 1-2 additional nights a week where she's out for work or social events, leading to 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to spend time with the family when they're together.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The husband is taking care of the kids on multiple nights and a full day on Fridays. He feels overwhelmed and doesn't want to leave the kids alone. The wife has her own commitments and suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. The main question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, both partners have their own needs. The wife has her dance hobby and social needs, which she's maintained since childhood. The husband is managing childcare on multiple nights and also a full day. It's possible that the husband's feelings are valid because he's handling a significant portion of childcare alone. However, the wife's perspective is that he could choose to go out, implying a balance. But the husband's preference is to be with the family, which is understandable given their busy schedule.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the wife is out, the husband is the only caregiver, which could be tiring, especially with a 6-month-old. It's also important to consider if they've discussed and agreed on a fair division of responsibilities. The wife's suggestion that he could go out might not consider his desire for family time. \n\nThere's no clear indication that the husband is being unreasonable. He's not avoiding responsibilities but is expressing a need for family time. The wife's commitments are longstanding and important to her well-being. However, the husband's feelings about the workload and desire for family time should be acknowledged.\n\nPossible angles: The husband isn't in the wrong because he's managing childcare and wants to be with his family. The wife's activities are her own, but maybe the frequency is causing strain. Alternatively, if the wife's schedule is causing disproportionate burden on the husband without compromise, maybe there's an issue. However, the husband is not refusing to help but is expressing his limits.\n\nIn summary, the husband's request for family time isn't inherently wrong. The wife's activities are part of her life, but maybe there's a need for better communication or adjusting schedules. The husband isn't the asshole here, so the answer would be B.\n"
