Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to be left alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author has a wife who dances and teaches on certain nights, and she also has other activities. The husband is handling the kids alone on those nights and wants to know if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has her own mental health needs and hobbies, which are important for her well-being. The husband, on the other hand, is taking on a lot of childcare responsibilities alone and feels it's impacting his ability to spend time with his family. \n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities and mutual support in a marriage. The wife is contributing by taking care of the kids on Fridays and part of Saturdays, but the husband is handling most of the childcare on other nights. The husband's issue isn't that he's not going out, but that he's uncomfortable being left alone with the kids when the wife is out for her activities. \n\nIt's important to assess whether the husband's expectations are reasonable. The wife is involved in her own activities, which are part of her mental health. The husband's desire for family time is valid, but he's also acknowledging that he doesn't want to go out, so he's not asking for the same from her. The question is whether expecting the wife to not leave him alone that often is fair. \n\nIf the wife is contributing by being with the kids on Fridays and Saturdays, maybe the balance isn't entirely off. However, the husband's workload seems heavy. If the wife is going out 2-4 nights a week, that's a significant number. But since they both work full-time and have daycare, maybe the arrangement is necessary. \n\nThe husband's main argument is that he's not the one going out; he's staying home to be with the kids. He's not complaining about the dancing or teaching, but the additional nights when she's out. The wife's suggestion that he could go out is rejected because he wants family time. \n\nThis seems like a common issue in marriages where both partners have personal needs and responsibilities. The husband isn't in the wrong if he's handling a large share of childcare and expects some reciprocity. However, if the wife's activities are within reasonable limits and she's contributing when she can, the husband might need to adjust his expectations. \n\nBut the husband is not asking the wife to stop her activities entirely, just not to leave him alone as often. It's about workload and shared responsibility. If the wife is doing her part on other days, maybe the husband's request is reasonable. Alternatively, if the wife's activities are necessary for her mental health, the husband might need to accept the current arrangement. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether the balance of responsibilities is fair. Since the husband is handling a significant portion of childcare alone, expecting some adjustment from the wife isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
