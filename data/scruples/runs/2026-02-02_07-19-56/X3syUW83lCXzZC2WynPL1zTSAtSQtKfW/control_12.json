Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has other activities like work dinners or friends. The husband is handling childcare on those nights and also on Fridays when he gets off work. He's not going out because he wants family time, but he's feeling overwhelmed by taking care of the kids alone multiple nights a week.\n\nThe key points here are about balance and mutual needs. The wife has her hobbies and social activities, which are important for her well-being. The husband is managing the kids on those nights, which is a significant responsibility. The question is whether it's fair for the husband to feel that the arrangement is unfair, especially since he's not reciprocating by going out.\n\nBut the husband doesn't want to go out, preferring family time. He's handling the kids alone, but he's not refusing to take care of them\u2014he's just feeling like he's shouldering more than his share. The wife is doing her part with work and dance, but maybe the husband's needs are being overlooked.\n\nHowever, the wife is also working full-time and has her own activities for self-care. The husband is taking on childcare multiple times a week, which is a lot. The question is whether it's unreasonable for him to want more support or shared responsibility. Since the user is asking if the author is wrong, the answer depends on societal expectations of equality in domestic responsibilities.\n\nIn many cases, it's expected that both partners share responsibilities. If the wife is doing her own activities but the husband is handling the kids alone multiple nights a week, maybe the balance isn't fair. The husband's request isn't to go out but to not be left alone with the kids. The wife insists he could go out, but he doesn't want to. So maybe the issue is the distribution of childcare duties rather than the activities themselves.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's managing the kids alone more than his wife, which could be an imbalance. The answer should be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for wanting a more balanced arrangement.\n"
