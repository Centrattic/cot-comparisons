Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a husband who's dealing with his wife's schedule. The wife dances and teaches twice a week and has other social or work events 1-2 nights a week. So that's 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. He's not upset about the dancing itself, as he understands it's important for her well-being. The issue is that he doesn't want to leave the kids with her when she goes out, even though she's offered. He feels that when they're all together, he wants to spend time with the family, not go out. The question is whether he's the asshole for being annoyed that she leaves him with the kids those nights.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics. The wife has her own activities which are important for her mental health. The husband is taking on a significant parenting role when she's away. But he's not against her having her time; the problem is that he doesn't want to leave the kids with her when she's out. He's not asking her to stop dancing, but he's not okay with other nights when she's not home. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, part of a relationship involves balance. Both partners need personal time and time with their partner. If the wife is able to take care of the kids when she's out, and he's okay with her having her activities, but he's not willing to reciprocate by taking time for himself, that might be an issue. The fact that he doesn't want to leave the kids with her, even though she's offered, could be seen as selfish, especially if he's the one who ends up with the kids more often. \n\nBut then again, he's not refusing to take care of the kids; he's just not wanting to go out. The problem is that the wife might be taking her space, and he's not taking his. It's possible that he's not recognizing her need for personal time as well. However, he's also doing a lot in terms of childcare, so maybe it's a matter of communication and finding a middle ground. \n\nIf the wife is okay with him not going out, and they can discuss their needs, maybe there's no real wrong here. But if he's annoyed because she's not there and expects her to stay home, that's another angle. The key point is whether his expectations are reasonable. Since he's not against her activities but is annoyed that he's left alone with the kids, maybe he's not considering that she's also contributing by taking care of them when she's home. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both are taking turns, maybe the husband could take some nights for himself. The fact that he doesn't want to go out is a personal choice, but if that's causing imbalance, it might be his responsibility to adjust. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not allowing for mutual space, even though he's contributing in childcare. Alternatively, if the wife is handling her part, and his annoyance is about the time alone, maybe not. It's a bit of a balance. \n\nBut the main issue is that he's not willing to let her have her time, even though he's okay with her taking care of the kids. That could be seen as being in the wrong because he's not respecting her need for personal time. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
