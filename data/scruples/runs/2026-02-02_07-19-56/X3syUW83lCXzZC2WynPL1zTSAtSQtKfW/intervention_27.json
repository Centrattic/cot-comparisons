Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturday, and has 1-2 other nights where she's out for work or social events. The husband takes care of the kids all those nights and weekends, but he's feeling overwhelmed and not wanting to go out himself because he wants family time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. Both work full-time, kids are in daycare during the day except on Fridays when the husband stays with them. The wife's activities are after work and on weekends. She's been dancing since childhood, which is important to her mental health. The husband is handling all the childcare duties on those nights. \n\nThe key points are the husband's resentment about the number of nights he's alone with the kids and the wife's insistence that he should go out. The husband doesn't want to leave the kids because he values family time. But maybe there's an imbalance here. The wife has her own needs and activities, which is valid, but the husband isn't getting any time for himself. \n\nHowever, the husband's request isn't about his own time per se\u2014it's about the wife not leaving him alone with the kids. He's okay with her not being around, but he doesn't want to go out, which the wife is suggesting. The problem is that he's not asking for his own time but is instead not wanting the wife to be away. This could imply that he expects the wife to be present more often, which might be a bit self-centered. Also, he's aware of her needs and appreciates them, so maybe his resentment is valid because he's taking on more childcare than he's comfortable with. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife's activities are necessary for her well-being and the husband is willing to take care of the kids, but he's now feeling burdened, maybe it's about communication and finding a balance. The wife might not realize the extent of his workload. However, the husband's issue is that he's not going out, but he's okay with staying with the kids. The fact that he's the one handling the kids most nights and he's not wanting to leave might be his own choice, so he could be in a position where he's choosing to take on the childcare, which isn't inherently wrong. \n\nBut maybe he's not considering that the wife's activities are part of her self-care, and his resentment is about expecting her to be present more. If he's happy to stay with the kids but gets annoyed when she's not around, that could be seen as expecting more from her. Alternatively, if the division of labor is unequal and he's doing more than his fair share, then maybe the wife's activities are a problem. But the story doesn't mention if the wife is also contributing otherwise. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's possible that the husband's expectations are a bit high, assuming that the wife should be available more. The wife's activities are part of her identity and mental health, so asking her to cut them down just because he's not going out might not be fair. The husband might need to find his own way to manage the kids or take some time for himself without expecting the wife to be present. \n\nSo putting it all together, the husband is expressing his feelings, but it's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's handling the kids and valuing family time. However, if he's not communicating his need for balance and expects the wife to adjust her activities, that could be the issue. But since he's stating he values her activities, maybe the problem is more about his own need for self-care versus expecting her to stay. Since he's not going out and is instead staying with the kids, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, his resentment might stem from unmet expectations about shared parenting responsibilities. \n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is reasonable. If he's okay with staying with the kids but is upset because the wife is away, that's his choice. However, if he's feeling overwhelmed and needs support, maybe he should seek other solutions rather than expecting the wife to stop her activities. The wife's insistence that he should go out might be a valid point, but if he's not interested in doing so, that's his autonomy. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. Since the husband is acknowledging the wife's needs but is struggling with his own, it's a two-way situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's handling the kids and valuing family time, but the situation requires better communication and perhaps renegotiating their roles. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
