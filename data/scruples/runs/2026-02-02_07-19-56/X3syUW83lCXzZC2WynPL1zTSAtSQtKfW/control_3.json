Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who's part of a family with two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. His wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and also has other commitments like work dinners or going out with friends, totaling 2-4 nights a week where he's alone with the kids. The author doesn't want to leave the kids alone with his wife on those nights because he values the family time they have together. He's asking if it's his fault for being annoyed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. Both work full-time, so their schedules are busy. The wife's activities are for her mental well-being, which is important. The husband is handling most of the childcare duties on these nights, plus the full day on Fridays and most of Saturday. He doesn't want to go out because he cherishes the rare family time.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. The wife's activities are personal and necessary for her happiness. The husband is contributing by taking care of the kids, which is a valid need. He's not refusing to help but is expressing that he also has a need for family time. It's about balance. The wife is doing more than her share by working full-time and having her hobbies. The husband is handling the kids when she's away, but he's not asking for more than his fair share; he just wants to spend time with them when he can. \n\nHowever, the wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. It's his choice, and he's honest about it. He's not refusing to help but is managing his own needs. Neither parent is a mind reader, so communication is key here. The author is seeking a reality check, not trying to assign blame. The question is about whether he's wrong for being annoyed. Since both have valid needs, it's a situation where compromise is needed. The author isn't in the wrong because he's not refusing to take care of the kids; he's just expressing his need for family time. The wife's activities are legitimate, but the husband's feelings are valid too. So, the answer is B.\n"
