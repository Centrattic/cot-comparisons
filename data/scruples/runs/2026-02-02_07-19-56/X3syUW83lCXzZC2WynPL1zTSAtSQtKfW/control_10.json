Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is married with two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other nights out for work events or socializing. The husband is taking care of the kids on those nights and on Fridays when he's off. He's asking if it's wrong that he's not okay with being left alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week and doesn't want to go out himself when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities each parent is taking on. The wife is working full-time, dancing, teaching, and has these other commitments. The husband also works full-time but has Fridays off, which he spends with the kids all day. On the other nights, when the wife is out, he handles dinner, baths, bedtime, etc. The wife suggests he could go out a few nights, but he doesn't want to because he values family time.\n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibilities and mutual understanding. The husband is clearly taking on a significant amount of childcare, especially with a 6-month-old and a toddler. The wife's activities are important to her well-being, which is valid. However, the husband feels overwhelmed because he's shouldering most of the childcare on those nights and weekends, and he's not interested in socializing when they are together.\n\nIs there an imbalance? The wife is out 3-4 nights a week, and he's alone with the kids. The husband doesn't want to leave the kids alone with her when she's out. He prefers to be with the family when they are together. The wife's suggestion that he should go out might be assuming he wants that, but he's clear he doesn't. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have needs. The wife needs time for herself and her hobbies, which are part of her mental health. The husband needs support in childcare, which is understandable given the age of the children. If they haven't found a middle ground, maybe they could adjust schedules or find other solutions, like using daycare on some nights or seeking outside help. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for not wanting to go out. \n\nThe husband isn't refusing to help; he's already doing a lot. His request is to have the time together when they're home. The wife isn't forcing him to stay home, but he's choosing to be with the kids. There's no indication he's being selfish or unreasonable. The wife is the one who leaves him alone with the kids, not the other way around. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's feelings are valid. He's not in the wrong for wanting to spend time with his family when they're all together and not wanting to be left alone with the kids. The wife should communicate and perhaps adjust her schedule to balance both their needs. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
