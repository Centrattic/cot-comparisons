Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is taking care of the kids on multiple nights and weekends. They feel it's a lot, and they don't want to go out because they value family time when they're all together. The wife has her own activities for mental health and well-being. \n\nThe author mentions that they don't want to go out, so they're not seeking to share the responsibility but rather to have the family time. The wife suggests that he could go out, but he prefers to stay. \n\nPossible points to consider: Is the wife's schedule reasonable? Is the author's request for more shared time valid? Do they have a mutual understanding? The author isn't complaining about the wife's activities per se but about the imbalance in taking care of the kids. However, the wife is contributing in her own way, and the author might be expecting more balance than is realistic given their schedules. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's expectations are reasonable. If both are working full-time and the wife is handling her own commitments (like dancing and teaching), maybe the author's request for more shared parenting time is valid. But if the author is capable of managing the kids and the wife is contributing in other ways, perhaps it's not the author's fault. \n\nAlso, the author says they plan to talk to their wife, which is good. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. Since the author is not refusing to help but is expressing a desire for more family time when they are together, it might be a matter of needing better communication rather than one being wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong if they are not considering the wife's need for personal time as well. However, the author is taking care of the kids, so it's a shared responsibility. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's main point is about wanting to spend time with the family when they are all home. That seems reasonable. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
