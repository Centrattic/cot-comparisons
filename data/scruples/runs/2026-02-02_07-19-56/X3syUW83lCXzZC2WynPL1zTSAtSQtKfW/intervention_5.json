Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's taking care of their kids most nights while the wife is out dancing, teaching, or socializing. The husband is annoyed that she's not home those nights and he's left alone with the kids, even though he's not interested in going out himself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife has been dancing since she was 5, which is important to her. They both work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day except on Fridays when the husband stays home. The wife's dancing is on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with no mention of her coming home in between. Then there are 1-2 other nights for work events or socializing. So total 3-4 nights a week where the husband is solo with the kids. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to stay home for family time.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's not the asshole for being annoyed. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider a few factors. First, the balance of responsibilities. Both parents work full-time, but the husband is taking on more childcare duties in the evenings. The wife's activities are important for her mental health, which is valid. However, the husband is shouldering the majority of the childcare in the evenings and on weekends. \n\nThe wife does offer a solution (he could go out), but he doesn't want to. His reasoning is that family time is rare. But is it fair to expect him to stay home while she goes out? Or is it unreasonable for him to not want to go out, especially when he's already handling all the childcare?\n\nAnother angle is communication. They've discussed this, but maybe the communication isn't fully addressing the husband's needs. The wife might be prioritizing her own needs without considering the husband's feelings and workload. However, the husband isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to spend time with the kids. \n\nAlso, the wife's dancing and social time could be a necessary part of her mental health. It's important for both partners to have their needs met. However, if the husband is consistently shouldering all the childcare duties, that might be an imbalance. The wife could be missing out on some family time, but the husband is also missing out on his own time.\n\nThe key point is whether the husband's annoyance is justified. Since he's not interested in going out, and the wife is out 3-4 nights a week, it's possible that the husband is overburdened. However, the wife's activities are for her well-being, which is also important. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the husband is contributing to the household and his wife is also contributing, but the distribution of childcare is uneven, then maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. However, if the wife's activities are causing the husband to feel overburdened and she's not making an effort to balance it, then the husband's feelings are valid. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The wife's needs are valid, but the husband's workload shouldn't be ignored. If the wife is not flexible and insists on her schedule without considering the husband's input, that might make her the asshole. But the question is about the husband. The husband isn't refusing to talk to her, he's seeking a reality check. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that he's not the asshole because he's not doing anything wrong. The problem is that the wife's schedule is leading to a situation where he's left alone. However, if the husband doesn't want to go out, perhaps he's not in the wrong for feeling that way. The wife's suggestion for him to go out is a solution, but he's not interested, which is his choice. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong for being annoyed? It depends on whether his annoyance is justified. Since he's handling most of the childcare and he's not getting time for himself, it's reasonable for him to feel that. The wife should consider adjusting her schedule or finding a compromise. But the husband's own choice not to go out might be a personal preference, not a wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the husband is expressing valid feelings about his workload and isn't making demands beyond wanting to be with his family when they're together. However, if the husband is not contributing in other ways or if the wife's schedule is excessive, that could change the perspective. But based on the given info, the husband's position seems reasonable, so he's not the asshole.\n"
