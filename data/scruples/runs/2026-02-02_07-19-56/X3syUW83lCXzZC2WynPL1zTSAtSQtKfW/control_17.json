Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. So first, I need to parse the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife have two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. They both work full-time. The kids go to daycare during the workdays, but the author gets Fridays off, so the kids are with him on those days. The wife dances and teaches on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and Saturday. She also has other nights where she's away for work dinners, staff meetings, friends, or a massage. So that adds up to 3-4 nights a week where the author is handling the kids alone. The wife suggests he could go out some nights, but he doesn't want to because they rarely get to be all together.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author is the asshole here. The key points to consider are the balance of responsibilities and expectations. The wife has her own activities that are important for her well-being, which the author acknowledges. But he's taking care of the kids multiple nights a week, including long days on Friday and Saturday. The wife's suggestion that he can go out implies some expectation that he should take some nights off, but he's not interested in doing so, which is his choice. \n\nHowever, it's also important to look at whether the wife's activities are reasonable. Dancing and teaching are part of her hobby and mental health, which is valid. But the question is about the author's annoyance. The wife is already working full-time and has her activities, but the author is handling the kids 3-4 nights. If their arrangement is that the author is handling most of the childcare when the wife is away, but the wife doesn't take on equal nights when the author is away, that might be an imbalance. The author is not wrong for feeling that they should be together more, especially if they both work and the kids need care. But does the wife have a right to those nights and the author's right to not go out? \n\nThe wife's activities are legitimate, and the author's willingness to take care of the kids shows responsibility. However, if the wife is suggesting he should go out and he doesn't want to, communication is key. The author is seeking a reality check before talking to his wife, which is good. The problem might be that the wife's current schedule is causing the author to feel overburdened. The answer would depend on whether the wife's activities are excessive or if the author's expectations about their time together are reasonable. Since the author is not forced to go out and has a valid reason to want family time, he's probably not in the wrong. But the wife's argument that he could go out might be causing the issue. The answer is B.\n"
