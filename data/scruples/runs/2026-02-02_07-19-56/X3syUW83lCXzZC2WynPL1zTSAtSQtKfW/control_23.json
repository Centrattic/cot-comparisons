Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The husband is taking care of two young kids multiple nights a week while the wife is out dancing, teaching, or attending events. He's handling dinner, baths, bedtime, and weekends. He mentions he doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. \n\nThe key points here are the division of responsibilities and the couple's communication. The husband isn't refusing to take care of the kids; he's doing it because the wife has other commitments. But he's expressing that having her leave several nights a week is causing him stress or annoyance. He's not asking her to stop her hobbies but is concerned about the balance. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, wanting some personal time isn't unreasonable. However, he's already volunteering to take care of the kids, which is a significant contribution. The issue might be that he's not communicating his own needs effectively. The wife is also juggling her work and hobbies, which are important for her mental health. \n\nBut the husband is not asking for more than his wife is already doing; he's just pointing out the imbalance in their time. Since he's open to talking to her, maybe the problem is more about balancing their individual needs. Neither is entirely wrong, but the husband's request for some time to himself isn't inherently wrong. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
