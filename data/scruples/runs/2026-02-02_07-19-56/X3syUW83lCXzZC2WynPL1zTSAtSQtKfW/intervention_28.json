Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The author has a wife who dances and teaches dance classes, which takes up Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday nights. Additionally, there are 1-2 other nights where she has work events, dinner meetings, or goes out with friends. That totals 3-4 nights a week where the author is alone with the kids. The wife suggests he could go out a few nights, but he doesn't want to because family time is rare.\n\nThe author's main question is whether he's the asshole for being annoyed that his wife leaves him alone with the kids so often, even though he's okay with her dancing. He's planning to talk to her but wants a reality check first. \n\nFirst, I should consider the balance of responsibilities. Both parents work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the week. The author has Friday off, so he stays with the kids that day. However, on the other days, he's taking care of the kids during their usual daycare hours. But when his wife is working, he's home with them. Wait, maybe I should clarify: when she dances, she doesn't come home and goes straight from work to dance. So on Tuesday and Wednesday, after work, she's at dance, so the author has to take over evening routines. On Saturday, he's with the kids all day until 2:30 PM when she comes home. \n\nThe key point is that the author is handling childcare for 3-4 nights a week by himself. The wife is suggesting he could use that time to go out, but he doesn't want to because he values family time. However, he's annoyed that she's not home during those times. \n\nNow, the question is whether this annoyance makes him the asshole. Let's think about the fairness of the situation. Both parents working full-time, but the author is handling most of the childcare alone. The wife's dancing is a long-standing hobby that's important to her mental health, which is valid. But if she's leaving him with all the childcare duties most of the week, that might be an unequal distribution of labor. \n\nThe author mentions that he's okay with her dancing but is annoyed about being left alone. The wife is suggesting he could use the time to go out, but if he doesn't want to, maybe the issue is that she's expecting him to be okay with the current arrangement without addressing the imbalance. \n\nIn a typical partnership, both parents should share childcare responsibilities. If the wife is dancing and doing other activities, perhaps the author expects her to also take on some of the nights. However, the author is in a position where he's not willing to use the time to go out, which the wife is suggesting. So maybe the problem is the wife's expectation that he can use the time for himself, even though he's not interested. \n\nBut the author is the one who is handling the kids every time she's away. If she's working full-time and dancing, maybe she's contributing in other ways, like during the day or with other tasks. The author might be feeling overwhelmed with the sole responsibility, even if he's okay with her needing time for herself. \n\nThe wife's argument is that he could go out, but if he doesn't want to, that's his choice. However, the author is annoyed because she's not home when he's taking care of the kids. It's possible that the wife's activities are legitimate, but the author is also valid in feeling the burden is on him. \n\nI need to check if 3-4 nights a week is a reasonable split. If they're both working full-time, childcare should be shared. If the wife is not taking any of the nights except when she dances, but she's suggesting that he could take some nights off, but he's not interested. The author might be in the wrong if he's not contributing to the childcare during the times he's with the kids on other nights. \n\nWait, the author says that on Friday he's with them all day, but on other days, maybe he's working. So when the wife is at work, he's at home, but when she's dancing, he's still handling the kids. However, when the wife is at her dance events, he's doing the evening routines. The wife is suggesting he could go out when she's at her events, but he doesn't want to. \n\nThe author's issue is that he doesn't want to be left alone with the kids those nights, but he's not asking her to stop dancing. Instead, he's frustrated that she's not home when he's handling the kids. The wife's dancing is part of her self-care, which is important, but if the childcare is falling entirely on him, maybe there's an imbalance. \n\nBut it's also possible that the wife is working full-time and dancing, which is her own time, so the author could use that time to do his own things. The problem is that the author is annoyed because she's not there, even though he's not using the time to go out. \n\nThe real issue here might be communication. The author is planning to talk to her, which is good. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is taking on the same share of childcare during her working hours, and the author is handling the extra when she's at dance, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But if the wife is working and he's working, and he's the one left with all the childcare responsibilities when she's away, that's an issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is okay with her dancing but is upset that he has to do all the work alone. The wife might need to adjust her schedule to share more responsibilities. But the author isn't asking for that; he's just expressing annoyance. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's dancing is 2-4 nights, but maybe the author is fine with her having a hobby, as long as they are together. However, the wife is suggesting he could use the time for himself, but he values family time more. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect the wife to not leave him alone those nights? If both parents are working, perhaps the author should take some nights off to have his own time, even if he's not interested. But the author is not going out, so maybe he's not being flexible. \n\nThe problem arises when the author is handling all the childcare alone for 3-4 nights a week, which might be more than fair. If the wife is working full-time and dancing, but the childcare is falling entirely on him, that's an issue. However, the author is not asking her to stop dancing; he's just annoyed about being alone. \n\nIf the wife is not contributing to the childcare during those nights, maybe the author is right to feel it's unfair. But the wife might be contributing in other ways during the week. The answer depends on whether the childcare split is fair. If the wife is working and the author is working, but he's handling most of the childcare, that's an issue. \n\nBut the author's main point is that he doesn't want to go out, so he's handling the kids. The wife is okay with that, but the author is annoyed that she's not home. The wife's hobbies are important for her well-being, so maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more flexible and for expecting her to be home. \n\nAlternatively, the wife might not be aware that the author is shouldering all the childcare. The author might need to communicate that he's okay with her hobbies but feels the childcare is unbalanced. \n\nIn the absence of knowing if the wife is handling other parts of childcare, the author's annoyance is valid. But if the wife is working and the author is also working, maybe the author is overstepping by being annoyed. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's handling a significant amount of childcare alone each week. Even if he's not interested in going out, it's reasonable to feel that the responsibility is unbalanced. The wife should also be taking on some of those nights. The author is justified in feeling this way, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
