Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who's upset that his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturday, and sometimes has other events. The husband doesn't want to go out and feels he's the only one handling the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has her own hobbies and activities which are important for her mental health. The husband is taking on a lot of childcare responsibilities, which is understandable given their work schedules and daycare setup. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The author is asking if it's okay for him to not want his wife to leave him with the kids so often. The key points here are about balance and mutual understanding. The wife is contributing in her way by working full-time and handling Saturday afternoons. The husband is handling the other nights and Fridays. \n\nHowever, the husband's issue is that he's not interested in going out, which would balance the responsibilities. But if the wife isn't willing to take more nights, maybe there's an imbalance. But is he wrong for not wanting to go out? That's a personal choice. He values family time, which is valid. The problem may be that he's expecting the wife to adjust her schedule, but she's already doing her part with dancing and other activities for her well-being.\n\nThe wife's needs for self-care and hobbies are important in a relationship. The husband's needs for personal time or relief from childcare are also valid. The issue here might be communication. The husband is planning to talk to his wife, which is a good step. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Not necessarily. However, if the wife's activities are reasonable and within normal bounds, the husband's frustration might stem from unmet personal needs rather than the wife being in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both are working full-time and taking on childcare. The wife's activities are after work and on weekends, which might not be unreasonable. The husband's not wanting to go out is his choice, but maybe he's missing an opportunity to share responsibilities differently. However, he's not obligated to go out; it's his preference. So, is he in the wrong for not wanting to take on more nights? Probably not. But if the wife's schedule is causing an imbalance, maybe there's a need for compromise. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong, and based on the information, it's more of a situational conflict where both have valid points. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's expectations are reasonable. Since he's not forcing the wife to stay home and she's meeting her needs, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and seeking understanding, which is a healthy approach.\n"
