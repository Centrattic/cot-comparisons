Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's upset because his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. He does all the childcare duties on those nights and weekends. He doesn't want to go out, preferring family time. His wife dances a lot and has other activities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both work full-time, kids in daycare during the week. The husband gets Fridays off, so he takes care of the kids that day. The wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday, and teaches on Saturday. Plus 1-2 other nights for work events or socializing. So total 3-4 nights. The husband isn't going out because he wants family time. He's not asking for help, just expressing annoyance.\n\nThe wife's activities are for her mental health. Dancing is a hobby she's had since childhood. Teaching on Saturday is part of her routine. The husband does all the childcare alone on those nights, which is a lot. But he's not asking for her to stop, just not to leave him alone. However, he's not offering to compromise either. He's not suggesting they split the duties or hire help. The wife offers that he could go out and leave her with the kids, but he doesn't want to.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, it's a balance between mutual needs. The wife has her mental health needs, and the husband wants to spend time with family. But the husband is taking on the majority of the childcare responsibilities when his wife is away. However, he's not refusing to share responsibilities; he's just not using the opportunity to go out. Maybe he should consider that the wife is contributing by taking on her own activities and teaching, which might be part of her work or personal time. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband's annoyance is valid. He's not asking for something unreasonable, but maybe he's not contributing equally. If he's not going out, maybe he's not sharing the burden. Alternatively, maybe it's unrealistic to expect him to do all the childcare on those nights. But he's not asking for anything; just expressing being annoyed. The answer depends on whether his expectations are reasonable. Since he's the one who's not going out and wants family time, but the wife is also contributing in her own way, perhaps the husband is the one in the wrong because he's not reciprocating by sharing the childcare duties when she's available. But he's the one who's taking care of the kids. Hmm. Maybe the wife is not wrong to have her activities, and the husband needs to find a way to communicate his needs better or suggest solutions like splitting duties or hiring help. Since he's the one who is taking all the childcare but not reciprocating when offered, maybe he is in the wrong. So Answer A.\n"
