Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is upset because his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week while she does her dance classes, teaching, and other activities. He's asking if he's the asshole for being annoyed about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple both work full-time, the kids go to daycare during the day. The husband has Fridays off, so he's with the kids that day. The wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, teaching on Saturdays. On top of that, there are 1-2 other nights where she goes out for work dinners, friends, or a massage. So, total 3-4 nights a week where he's alone with the kids. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife is pursuing her own interests for mental well-being, which is important. The husband is taking care of the kids, which is a valid and tiring responsibility. He's not asking for her to stop her activities but is expressing that he feels alone and wants family time. \n\nI should check if there's a balance. The wife is contributing by working full-time and doing her dance activities. The husband is also working full-time and taking on the childcare duties when she's away. However, he's not against her going out per se, but he's feeling like it's affecting his desire for family time. \n\nIs there a communication issue? The user says he plans to talk to his wife, which is good. But maybe the problem is that they haven't found a middle ground. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. It's about their differing needs. The husband isn't the asshole if he's honest about his feelings without being selfish. He's not asking her to give up her hobbies but wants mutual consideration for family time. \n\nAlso, considering childcare responsibilities, it's a lot for one parent to handle multiple nights. The wife might not be sharing the load equally, but that's not the husband's fault. It's a teamwork issue. Unless there's a clear imbalance in other areas (like he's not helping during the week), he's not wrong for wanting to spend time with the kids when they're home together. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong). The problem is a common one where both partners have valid needs and need to communicate better to find a solution that works for both.\n"
