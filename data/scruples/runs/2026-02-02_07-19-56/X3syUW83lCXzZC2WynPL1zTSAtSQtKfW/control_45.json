Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband (the author) is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband has two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. She also has other commitments like work dinners, meetings, or time with friends, totaling 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. The wife suggests the husband could go out, but he doesn't want to because he values family time.\n\nThe husband isn't complaining about the wife's hobbies or the fact that she's doing things for her well-being. He's okay with her dancing. The main issue is that he's taking care of the kids alone on those nights and days, and he's wondering if it's unfair that he's the one who's doing all the work while she's out. However, he doesn't want to go out, so he's stuck with the kids.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The wife is working full-time, he does too, but he gets Fridays off. The wife's activities are for her mental health and hobbies. The husband is handling the childcare alone but isn't against his wife's activities per se. The key here is whether it's unreasonable for him to feel this way. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing responsibilities is important. The wife is not necessarily shirking her duties; she's engaged in activities that are important to her. The husband might feel the workload is uneven, but he's not opposed to her having her time. The wife suggests he could go out, but he chooses not to. That choice is his, so he's not being forced. \n\nHowever, the question is about being in the wrong. If the husband is not objecting to his wife's activities and is okay with managing the kids alone, then maybe he's not in the wrong. He's expressing a need for more time with the family when they're together. On the other hand, if the wife is taking on the same amount of work and he's just not wanting to leave, maybe there's a balance to consider. But the wife is working full-time and has her activities. The husband is handling the childcare when she's out. It might be a matter of perspective. The husband isn't upset about her activities but the frequency. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not opposing her activities and is handling the responsibilities. The issue is more about wanting to be with the family when they're all together, which is valid. The wife's suggestion for him to go out is a choice he's not making, so he's not wrong for preferring family time. So, the answer is B.\n"
