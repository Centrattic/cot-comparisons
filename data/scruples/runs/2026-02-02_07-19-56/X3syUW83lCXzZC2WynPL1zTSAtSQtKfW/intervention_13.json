Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. He's asking for a reality check.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife has been dancing since she was 5, which is a hobby important to her mental health. She does it twice a week and teaches on Saturdays. Additionally, there are other nights when she has work events, friends, or a massage. So total 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. He mentions he's taking care of them, but he's annoyed because he doesn't want to go out, and he values family time when they're all together.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual expectations and fairness. The wife is pursuing her hobbies and maintaining her social life, which is important for her well-being. The husband, on the other hand, prioritizes quality time with his family. Both have valid needs. However, the question is whether the husband is wrong for being annoyed when his wife is away.\n\nThe husband doesn't want to go out, so he's not seeking a reciprocal arrangement. The wife is contributing in other ways, like managing the kids during the day when he's working. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband plans to talk to his wife, which is good. But is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his expectations are unreasonable. If the wife's activities are within a reasonable range and the husband isn't contributing in other ways, maybe not. But if he's not sharing responsibilities or if there's an imbalance, maybe. However, the story doesn't indicate that the wife is taking more than her fair share. The husband's annoyance might stem from his own priorities rather than an actual unfairness. So, perhaps the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because both have valid needs and the situation isn't clearly unjust.\n"
