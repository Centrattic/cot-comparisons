Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's taking care of the kids alone 2-4 nights a week while his wife dances, teaches, and goes out. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time and feels overwhelmed. The wife says he could go out, but he doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is handling most of the childcare duties on those nights, which can be exhausting, especially with a 6-month-old and a 3-year-old. He's not asking for the wife to stop her activities, which are important for her well-being. He's just expressing that he's tired of being alone with the kids so much. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has her own reasons for needing time for dancing and social activities. Her mental health is important, and she's contributing by working full-time and managing her schedule. She suggests he could go out, but he's choosing not to, which might mean they have different needs in terms of personal time versus family time.\n\nThe key points here are communication and balance. The husband is aware he needs to talk to his wife, which shows he's trying to address the issue. The question is whether his feelings are valid. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because it's a matter of differing needs and expectations. However, the wife's activities are also legitimate. The husband isn't refusing to help or being neglectful; he's just feeling the burden is uneven on those specific nights. Since both are contributing in their own ways, it's more about finding a balance rather than one being right or wrong. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
