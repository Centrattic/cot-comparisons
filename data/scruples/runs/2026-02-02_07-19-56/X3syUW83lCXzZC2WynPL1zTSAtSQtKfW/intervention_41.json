Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is at fault for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple has two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other commitments like work events or socializing. The husband handles the kids on those nights and weekends. He's not against her activities but feels it's a lot and doesn't want to go out, preferring family time. He's asking if he's the asshole for being annoyed.\n\nNow, the key points here are about balancing individual needs and family responsibilities. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which are important for her well-being. The husband is taking on a significant share of childcare, which is commendable, but he's feeling overwhelmed or perhaps resentful about it. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if he's overstepping.\n\nThe husband mentions that he appreciates her need for mental and emotional well-being regarding dancing. That's a good sign he's trying to understand her perspective. However, he's upset about the additional nights she's away. He's not asking her to stop her activities entirely but is expressing frustration about the frequency. \n\nIt's important to consider the dynamics of their relationship. If both are working full-time, dividing responsibilities is crucial. The wife is taking some nights off, but the husband is handling the majority of the childcare during her absence. The fact that he's taking over on Fridays and most of Saturdays adds up. The issue might be communication\u2014if they've discussed this and she's still insistent on her schedule without adjustments, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's own desire for family time. He's not going out, which is his choice, but he's also not getting time away. It's a common issue in parenting where one parent may take on more childcare duties and feel unappreciated. The husband's annoyance might stem from the imbalance in responsibilities rather than the activities themselves.\n\nHowever, the wife has her own valid reasons for her activities. Dancing is a long-standing hobby for her, and she might need that outlet. Teaching on Saturdays is part of her work or passion. The husband's request isn't for her to stop but to not leave him alone as often. But if she's not willing to compromise, maybe the problem lies in their communication or how they split responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have needs. The husband's need for family time is natural, especially with young children. But the wife also has her own needs. The problem arises if one side isn't considering the other's perspective. The husband says he's going to talk to her, which is a good step. However, if he's not open to her perspective or if he's expecting her to change without offering to adjust his own approach, that could be where the issue is.\n\nAnother factor is the number of nights. 2-4 nights a week, plus days on Friday and Saturday. That's a substantial portion of the week. If the husband is handling all that alone, it might be reasonable for him to feel it's a lot. The question is whether his frustration is justified given the circumstances. If the wife isn't contributing equally during those nights, or if the arrangement wasn't mutually agreed upon, then his feelings are valid.\n\nBut the wife might argue that she's already balancing her work and her hobbies and that the husband is capable of handling the kids. If that's the case, maybe the husband isn't being considerate enough of her needs. However, the husband's argument is that he's not against her activities but the frequency and the resulting time alone with the kids. It's about the balance between individual autonomy and shared responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is reasonable. If he's not asking her to stop her activities but is expressing his need for more balanced time, then he's not in the wrong. However, if his frustration stems from an expectation that she should always stay home or that he should have more time without considering her needs, then he might be at fault. The key is mutual understanding and negotiation. Since the husband is planning to discuss it with her, it's a step towards resolving the issue. Without more info, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong if he's expressing his feelings constructively.\n"
