Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife is away 2-4 nights a week, leaving him with the kids, and he's not okay with it. He doesn't want to go out, but he's annoyed that she's not home. \n\nFirst, the wife has a long-standing hobby (dancing) and does it 2 nights a week, plus teaches on Saturday. She also has work-related events or social time. The author handles childcare those nights and on Fridays and Saturdays. He says he's not against her dancing but is annoyed when she's out 2-4 nights. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife is contributing in her own way, and the author is taking on a significant childcare role. However, expecting the wife to stay home more might be unreasonable, especially since she has her own interests and needs. The author is choosing not to use the time he's alone to go out, which is his choice. If he's not interested in socializing, his annoyance might stem from feeling overwhelmed or resentful, but that's a personal feeling.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author plans to talk to his wife, which is good. But whether he's in the wrong depends on mutual expectations. If the wife's activities are reasonable and the author isn't contributing in other ways, maybe he's not wrong. However, he's not addressing the balance of responsibilities. The wife is working full-time, dancing, and has her own social time. The author is taking on extra childcare, which is valid, but if he's not okay with it, he needs to discuss it. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because his feelings are valid, but he should communicate better. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong if he's not sharing the load equally. But since he's handling the kids, maybe he's not wrong. I think the answer is B (No), but I need to check the details again. The wife is working, dancing, and has her own social activities. The author is handling the childcare, which is a lot, but he's not against her dancing. His issue is that she's out 2-4 nights. If the wife's schedule is necessary for her well-being and the author is okay with the dancing but not the other nights, it's a bit of a communication issue. He might need to talk about how it affects him, but he's not in the wrong for feeling that way. So the answer is B.\n"
