Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids multiple nights a week. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has other commitments like work events or social outings. That adds up to 3-4 nights where the husband is solely responsible for the kids. He mentions he doesn't want to go out because he values family time. He's asking if he's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. So, the wife's activities are partly for her mental health and partly work-related. The husband is taking on the childcare duties, but he's feeling overwhelmed. The key points here are about shared responsibilities and communication. \n\nThe husband says he doesn't mind the dancing and teaching, but the additional nights are causing him stress. He's not asking for equality but maybe some acknowledgment of his workload. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers family time. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have their own needs. The wife has her hobbies and social needs, which is normal. The husband is handling the kids during her absence, which is a big responsibility. However, he's not explicitly complaining about the workload but about the fact that she's not there. \n\nIs he being selfish? Maybe not. It's reasonable to want quality time with the family. But is he expecting her to change her habits just because he prefers to stay home? That could be a point. On the other hand, if she's taking on the same number of responsibilities when he's away, maybe there's an imbalance. \n\nThe user mentions they are going to talk, but the question is about whether the author is wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms, expectations in relationships, and work-life balance. Since both are working full-time, managing childcare is a shared responsibility. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting some family time, especially since he's handling the kids on Fridays. \n\nBut the number of nights seems high. Maybe the wife isn't contributing equally when he's available. However, the husband isn't asking for help; he's expressing a desire for her to stay. If he's okay with the dancing and teaching, the extra nights are the issue. The answer hinges on whether his preference for family time is reasonable. Since he's not asking her to stop her activities but is asking for her to stay, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, maybe he's not considering that she also needs her time. \n\nWait, the wife's activities are part of her work (teaching) and hobbies, which are important. The husband's issue is not with the activities themselves but with her absence. If he's able to handle the childcare, maybe it's a matter of him needing to voice his feelings and find a compromise. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's just expressing a need for family time, which is valid. The wife might need to adjust her schedule slightly, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting that.\n"
