Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the husband is asking for advice because he's annoyed that his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. They have two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. His wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and also has 1-2 other nights where she does things like work dinners, friends' dinners, or a massage. The husband takes care of the kids by himself on those nights and during the day on Fridays and part of Saturdays. He says he's not against his wife having her hobbies and that he appreciates her need for them, but he's tired of being alone all the time and feels he should be able to leave the kids with her once in a while. However, he doesn't want to go out, so he's just annoyed when she leaves. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both parents work full-time. The kids are in daycare during the day, so when the wife is at work, the daycare takes care of them. On Fridays, the husband stays home with the kids. The wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, meaning she doesn't come home. On Saturdays, she teaches, and the husband is with the kids until 2:30 PM. Then there are 1-2 more nights where she's out for other reasons. So in total, 3-4 nights a week the husband is alone with the kids, plus the day on Friday and part of Saturday.\n\nThe husband's main issue isn't that he's not helping, but that he's tired of being alone all the time. He doesn't want to go out, so the time they have together is when he's home with the kids. He's not asking to go out, but he's upset that she leaves him to handle it all. The wife's argument is that he could go out and leave the kids with her once in a while, but he chooses not to. \n\nNow, am I the asshole here? Let's break it down. The wife has her own activities that are important for her well-being, which is understandable. Both parents have their own time when the kids are with them. The husband is doing his part by staying home on Fridays and handling the kids during the day. However, when the wife is away on other nights, he's alone with the kids. But he's not saying he can't handle it; he's saying he's annoyed that he's the one always left alone. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband is in the wrong for feeling this way. If the wife's schedule is fixed and necessary for her (like teaching, which might be a job or something important), then maybe it's not his fault. However, if he's not contributing equally in other ways or if the arrangement is unfair, maybe he's not in the wrong. But since he's doing all the childcare on Fridays and part of Saturdays, and the wife is doing her own things on other nights, perhaps the wife's time is more limited. \n\nWait, the wife's out 2-4 nights a week and during part of Saturday. The husband is home with the kids on Friday and until 2:30 on Saturday. If they both work full-time, maybe the wife's job requires her to be out those nights, and her dancing is a hobby. If she's teaching on Saturdays, that might be a job-related commitment. The husband is doing more childcare on his day off. \n\nBut the husband's problem is that he's left alone every time she's out. The wife suggests he could leave the kids with her when he can, but he's choosing not to because he values family time. So maybe he's not in the wrong for not wanting to go out. The question is about being annoyed when the wife leaves him alone. \n\nIn some cultures, the assumption is that the man takes the kids when the wife has her time, but in a modern context, both parents should share responsibilities. If the wife's other activities are for her well-being and not work, maybe she should consider the husband's feelings. But the husband is also not going out, so he's not contributing to balancing it. \n\nHe's not asking for equality in time off, but expressing that when they are together, he's stuck with the kids all the time. The wife's argument is that he could leave, but he's choosing not to. So maybe the husband is not in the wrong for being annoyed, but he could be seen as not sharing the responsibility if he's not using those nights to have time for himself. However, he's not complaining about the childcare itself, but the fact that he's left alone. \n\nIt might depend on how their schedules are structured. If the wife's time with the kids is limited due to her job and dance commitments, but the husband's time is more flexible, then maybe the husband's expectation is reasonable. However, if the wife's activities are non-negotiable and the husband is voluntarily choosing to stay home with the kids, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the core issue is the fairness in the division of childcare. If the wife is out 3-4 nights, and the husband is home with the kids, maybe it's unbalanced. The husband could be in the right to feel that the wife's absence on weekends and nights is leading to him having no free time. However, if the wife is also handling the kids during the week when he's at work, maybe it's balanced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife's dance and teaching are part of her job, so she's working on those nights. If that's the case, then she's working and can't be with the kids, but the husband's job allows him to stay home more. \n\nThe husband's AITA is about being annoyed when his wife leaves him alone with the kids. If he's home with them during the day on his off day and on part of Saturday, but she's out 2-4 nights, maybe he's not wrong because he's not opposing her activities but is upset about the alone time. The wife's response that he could go out if he wanted is a bit of a defense. \n\nIn conclusion, unless the husband is not contributing in other areas, he's not in the wrong. His annoyance is about the imbalance in who is left with the kids. So answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
