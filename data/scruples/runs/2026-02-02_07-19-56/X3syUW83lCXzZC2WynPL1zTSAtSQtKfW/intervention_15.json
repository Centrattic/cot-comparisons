Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is upset because his wife is going out 2-4 nights a week, leaving him alone with the kids. He's feeling overwhelmed and wants to talk to her, but he's also saying he doesn't want to go out, preferring family time. The wife has her own reasons for dancing and other activities.\n\nHmm, so first, the husband is handling the kids on those nights. He's doing all the childcare. He mentions he's not against her dancing or her activities, but the frequency is causing him stress. The key points here are the balance of responsibilities and mutual needs in a relationship.\n\nThe wife has been dancing since she was a child, which is part of her mental health. She's also working full-time. The husband is also working full-time and taking care of the kids on Fridays and some Saturdays. He's not asking her to stop her activities but is expressing his need for more support or shared responsibility.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong. Let me consider that. Is it wrong for the husband to feel that he's shouldering more than he's comfortable with? Well, in relationships, both partners need to have their needs met. If the wife is doing her own things without considering how it affects the husband, that's a problem. But if the husband isn't communicating his needs effectively or isn't sharing the burden equally, that could also be an issue.\n\nWait, the husband says he's not asking her to stop dancing. He's just annoyed because he's alone with the kids. But he's also saying he doesn't want to go out, so he's not seeking to reduce his own time. That might be a point. If he doesn't want to have child-free nights, maybe he's expecting her to stay home too. But she has her own needs and hobbies. \n\nAnother angle: both partners have to work and have their own lives. The fact that the husband is handling the kids alone some nights might be normal, but if he's overwhelmed, that's valid. However, the wife might be contributing in other ways. The husband needs to communicate his feelings and maybe find a solution together, like taking turns handling the kids or finding other support.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's not unreasonable and just wants more family time, but she's also contributing by having her own activities, maybe it's a balance issue. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's expectations are reasonable. If he's not willing to compromise or find a middle ground, like suggesting some nights where he can have time to himself, then maybe he's in the wrong. However, if he's honestly expressing his feelings and not making demands, he's in the right.\n\nThe key here is that the husband is feeling overwhelmed and isn't asking her to stop her activities, but he's also not willing to go out. The wife's insistence that he could go out might not consider his preference for family time. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing a valid need, but he could be in the wrong if he's not offering solutions or being too rigid.\n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But maybe not. The main issue is mutual understanding and compromise. The author's problem is valid, but he needs to approach it with understanding. However, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's not the one causing the issue. The wife is going out, and he's handling the kids. If he's not overstepping and is just expressing his feelings, then he's not the asshole. So the answer could be B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
