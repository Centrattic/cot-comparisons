Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, the husband has two kids, day jobs, and on Fridays, he takes care of them. The wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes goes out for work or social events. That adds up to 3-4 nights where he's alone with the kids. He says he doesn't mind the dancing and teaching but is annoyed because he doesn't want to go out on those nights when the kids are with him.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for feeling this way. The user thinks he is wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me consider the arguments. The husband is taking on a lot of childcare duties, which can be exhausting. However, he's aware that the wife has her own commitments and has acknowledged her need for personal time. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to stay with the kids when they're all together. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners have their own responsibilities and need time for themselves. The husband's request for personal time isn't unreasonable, but he's not pushing for it, just expressing annoyance. The wife has her justified reasons, but the husband's feelings are valid too. However, the key point is that he's not refusing to take care of the kids or complaining about the wife's activities; he's just not wanting to go out when she does. It's more about personal preference than a wrongdoing. \n\nThe husband's annoyance might stem from feeling overwhelmed or missing family time, but he's not asking for less responsibility. The wife's schedule is necessary for her well-being, and she's covering the childcare during the day. The husband's choice to prioritize family time isn't inherently wrong. So, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. He's just navigating the balance between personal time and family duties. The answer might be B.\n"
