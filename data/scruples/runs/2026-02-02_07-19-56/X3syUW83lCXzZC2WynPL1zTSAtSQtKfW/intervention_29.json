Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's upset because his wife leaves him to take care of the kids 2-4 nights a week while she goes to dance, works events, or spends time with friends. He doesn't want to go out, so he feels like he's stuck with the kids every time she leaves. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has two young children, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old, which means the workload is significant. Both parents work full-time, and the daycare setup means the kids are at home with him on Fridays. The wife's activities include dancing twice a week and teaching on Saturdays, plus additional nights for work events or socializing. The husband is handling most of the childcare responsibilities on these nights.\n\nThe husband says he's not against his wife's activities\u2014he understands they're important for her well-being. His issue is that he doesn't want to leave the kids to go out, so when she's away, he's left alone with them. He doesn't want to be alone with the kids that many nights. The wife suggests he could go out sometimes, but he prefers to stay and spend time with the family when they're together.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, I should think about mutual support in a relationship. It's common for both partners to need personal time, so the wife's activities might be necessary for her mental health. However, the husband's feelings are valid too. He might feel overwhelmed with the childcare duties and missing the family time. The key here is balance and communication.\n\nThe husband mentions he's going to talk to his wife, which is the right approach. The question is whether his desire to have more time with the kids without having to manage them alone multiple nights a week is reasonable. If the wife is taking on her own activities without considering the husband's capacity, maybe she's not sharing the responsibilities equally. But the husband's stance is that he doesn't want to leave the kids, which is understandable. However, expecting the wife to stop her activities because he doesn't want to go out might not be fair. Relationships require compromise, and maybe the husband could find a way to spend time with the kids while also allowing the wife her personal time without feeling resentful.\n\nOn the other hand, if the husband is handling the majority of childcare duties and isn't getting support, that could be a problem. The wife might be relying too much on him, but the husband's resistance to leaving the kids might be a personal choice rather than a lack of willingness to share responsibilities. It's possible he's not in the wrong here because he's expressing his needs, but maybe there's a way to adjust schedules or find middle ground.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether either party is making unreasonable demands. The wife has her reasons for her activities, and the husband has his reasons for wanting to stay. But if the husband's unwillingness to go out is causing the imbalance, maybe he's not considering that sharing childcare could allow both to have time for themselves. However, it's also about what works for both partners. If the wife is already doing her part by covering some nights and the husband is handling the rest, but he's still overwhelmed, it's a communication issue rather than one person being wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the husband is expecting the wife to adjust her schedule solely to meet his needs without considering her own. If he's not open to any solution where he might have to take on more or find alternative childcare, that could be where he's at fault. But since he's just expressing his feelings and hasn't made demands beyond talking, maybe he's not in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because he's sharing his perspective and seeking a balance, not necessarily being unreasonable. The wife might need to adjust, but he's not the asshole here.\n"
