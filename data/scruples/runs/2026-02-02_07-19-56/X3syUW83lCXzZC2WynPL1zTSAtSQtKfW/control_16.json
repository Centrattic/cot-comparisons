Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The situation is that the wife has her dance classes and teaching, plus some other activities, leading to the husband handling the kids on those nights and days. The husband isn't against going out but wants to stay home when the family is together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife's dancing is a long-standing hobby that's important for her mental health. The husband is taking care of the kids on those nights, which sounds like a significant commitment. He also has the kids on Fridays, which is his day off. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to stay home with the family when they're all together.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to feel this way? Well, he's not asking for anything unreasonable. He's just expressing a preference to spend time with the family when they're all present. The wife's activities are her personal time, which is important for her well-being. However, the husband's request isn't to prevent her from doing those activities but to not leave him alone with the kids those nights. \n\nThe key points are mutual understanding and balance. The husband supports her dancing, and she's taking care of the kids when she's with them on Fridays. The issue is the additional nights when she's out. The husband's annoyance might stem from the imbalance in their time with the kids. However, since he's willing to take care of the kids when she's out, it's more about his desire for family time rather than resentment towards her activities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if they've discussed this and the wife is insistent, the husband's feelings are valid. He's not being selfish but expressing a need for family time. The wife's suggestion that he could go out shows she's trying to balance, but he's choosing not to go out because he values family time. There's no indication he's being unreasonable in his request; he's just not interested in going out. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The situation requires communication and finding a compromise that respects both their needs. The husband isn't at fault for wanting to spend time with his family when they're all together.\n"
