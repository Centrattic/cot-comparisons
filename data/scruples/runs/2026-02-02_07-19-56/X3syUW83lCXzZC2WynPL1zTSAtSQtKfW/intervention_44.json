Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author mentions that his wife dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays, and there are additional nights she's out for work or social events. He's handling the kids alone on those nights and feels it's a burden, even though he understands her need to dance. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has her own reasons for dancing and other activities, which are important for her well-being. The author is taking on a lot of childcare responsibilities when she's away, which is understandable given the young kids. But he's feeling overwhelmed and is asking if it's reasonable for him to be annoyed.\n\nIn terms of fairness, they both have full-time jobs and shared responsibilities. The daycare situation during the day might help, but on Fridays and Saturdays, the author is home with the kids. The wife's activities add up to 3-4 nights, which is a significant chunk. The author isn't resisting doing the work but is frustrated by the frequency and wants more family time.\n\nThe key points are mutual understanding and communication. The author acknowledges his wife's needs, which is good. However, expecting her to stop all her activities might be unreasonable. On the flip side, the author's desire for family time is valid. The question is whether his frustration is justified given that he's handling the responsibilities. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's not necessarily being selfish, but maybe he hasn't considered compromising. If the wife is willing to let him go out, but he doesn't want to, that's his choice. However, he might need to find a middle ground. The fact that he's seeking a reality check shows he's trying to communicate. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but he needs to discuss it with his wife to find a solution rather than just expecting her to change her habits. The main issue is balance and shared responsibilities, not outright wrongdoing.\n"
