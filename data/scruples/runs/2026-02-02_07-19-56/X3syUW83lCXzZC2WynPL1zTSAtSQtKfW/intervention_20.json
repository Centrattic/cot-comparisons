Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturday, and has other activities, leading to the husband handling the kids alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a long-standing hobby (dancing) and it's important for her mental health. She's also working full-time, and they both have jobs. The husband is handling childcare responsibilities on those nights. He mentions he doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together. \n\nBut wait, the wife suggested he could go out and leave her with the kids. The husband says he doesn't want to go out. Is it fair for him to expect his wife to stay home when she has her own needs and responsibilities? The question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed because she's not home those nights.\n\nThe husband is handling the kids, which is a lot, but he's not complaining about the tasks themselves. He's annoyed that she's not there. The key point is about shared responsibility and mutual needs. The wife has her activities, and the husband values family time. It's a balance between personal needs and family time. \n\nIs it unreasonable for the husband to want more time with his family? Maybe not. But the wife's activities are for her well-being, which is also valid. The husband doesn't seem to object to the tasks he's doing, just the absence of his wife. The wife's suggestion for him to go out implies that she thinks he should have his own time. However, he's declining that and instead wants her to stay. \n\nThis might be about unspoken expectations. The husband might be assuming that the wife should prioritize family time over her own activities, but they haven't discussed it fully. Since the husband is willing to talk to her, maybe the issue is communication rather than right or wrong. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. If the wife's activities are reasonable and part of her mental health, then expecting her to stop them might be unfair. The husband is handling the kids, which is his responsibility, but he's not alone in childcare since the wife has other days. The husband's annoyance is about not having his wife there, not about the childcare tasks themselves. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have their needs met. The husband's need is family time, the wife's is personal time. If they can't balance it, maybe there's a problem. But the husband isn't asking for help, he's asking why the wife isn't there. The wife's perspective is that she's contributing in other ways. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong entirely because his feelings are valid. But maybe he's not considering that the wife has her own needs. However, since he's not asking her to stop her activities but is instead upset about her absence, it's a bit of a conflict of priorities. The answer might depend on how balanced their contributions are. But given the info, the husband's desire for family time isn't necessarily wrong. So maybe answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
