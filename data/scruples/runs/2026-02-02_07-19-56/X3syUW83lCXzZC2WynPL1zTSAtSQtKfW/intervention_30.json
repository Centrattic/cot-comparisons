Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife has her own schedule with dancing, teaching, and social events. Both work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day. The author handles childcare on Fridays and Saturdays when the wife is away. The key points here are the balance of responsibilities and mutual understanding.\n\nFirst, the wife's activities are for her mental health. Dancing has been a hobby since childhood, so it's important for her well-being. The author mentions they've talked about it, and the wife suggested he could go out, but he prefers family time. Both have their reasons. The author isn't complaining about the responsibility itself but about the fact that the wife is leaving, leading to him being alone with the kids. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the arrangement is fair and if both parties' needs are being respected. The author isn't refusing to take care of the kids but expresses a desire for more family time. The wife's activities are legitimate, and the author's preference for family time is also valid. Since both have explained their perspectives and the author is open to talking, it seems like a mutual issue rather than one person being wrong. So, maybe the answer is B, but I need to check if there's an imbalance in expectations or communication.\n"
