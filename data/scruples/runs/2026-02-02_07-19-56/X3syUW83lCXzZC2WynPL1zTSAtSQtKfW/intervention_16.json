Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's annoyed that his wife leaves him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. He's not against her dancing or her activities, but he feels like when they are home together, he wants to spend time with the family, and she's not there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both work full-time, kids are in daycare except on Fridays when the husband is home. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and occasionally has work or social events. The husband handles all the childcare on those nights and weekends. He doesn't want to leave the kids to go out because he values family time.\n\nThe key points here are balance and communication. The wife is maintaining her own mental health through her dancing, which is important. The husband is taking on a lot of childcare, which is also significant. The question is whether his annoyance is justified or if he should be more flexible.\n\nThe author claims he doesn't want to go out, but maybe the issue is that he's expecting his wife to stay home more when he's home. However, there's a mutual responsibility in parenting. If he's home, he's choosing to be present, but maybe the wife is also balancing her needs. The husband might be taking on more childcare than is fair, especially if the wife is working full-time too.\n\nAnother angle is whether the husband is contributing enough to the childcare during the week when they are both working. If he's only home on Fridays, maybe the other days the wife is handling it. But the problem is the nights when she goes out. Is it reasonable for her to have a few nights to herself? The husband's complaint is that he's left alone, but he's also prioritizing being with the kids when they're together. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that he could go out, but he doesn't want to. That might mean that the husband is okay with the current arrangement but just feels resentful because he's the one left with the kids. The problem might be communication\u2014maybe they need to negotiate who takes on more childcare or find a middle ground. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have their own needs. The wife's dancing is important for her well-being, which is valid. The husband's desire for family time is also valid. The issue is whether the distribution of responsibilities is balanced. If the wife is working and dancing, and the husband is home on Fridays and handling the kids on her dancing nights, maybe he's taking on more than his share. However, the husband is also working full-time, so it's a two-income household where both are busy. \n\nThe key might be whether the husband is contributing equally to childcare during the week. If he's only home on Fridays and she's handling the rest, then when she goes out a few nights a week, maybe it's not fair for him to expect her to always be there. But if he's taking on a significant portion of the childcare on the days he's available, then maybe the wife's schedule is causing an imbalance.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's activities are also part of her self-care. The answer might depend on whether the husband's expectations are reasonable. If he's okay with her having a few nights to herself, but just wants more family time when they are home together, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife is working and has her own schedule, the husband might need to adjust his expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation requires better communication and negotiation. The husband might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but he should consider whether his expectations are realistic given the circumstances. The wife's activities are important for her mental health, which is a valid reason. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the husband's feelings are valid and the wife isn't overstepping, but there's a need for mutual adjustment.\n"
