Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The situation involves both spouses working full-time, with the wife having hobbies and social activities that take her away, leaving the husband to handle childcare. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is handling a lot already with daycare on regular days, plus specific days (Fridays and Saturdays) where he's the primary caregiver. The wife's absences add 2-4 nights a week, which he's finding burdensome. He doesn't want to go out, valuing family time, but he's frustrated when she leaves him alone.\n\nThe wife's side: she's pursuing her hobbies and has valid reasons for her schedule (dance classes, teaching, work-related events). She offers that the husband could go out, but he doesn't want to. Communication has already occurred, but there's a mismatch in expectations.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong for feeling overwhelmed. The wife's activities are part of her well-being, but the husband's needs for quality family time are also valid. The crux is about shared responsibilities and communication. If both aren't equally sharing the childcare duties, that could be an issue. But the wife is already contributing in other ways (work, teaching, dancing for her mental health). The husband's frustration might stem from a lack of support from her during those nights, but he hasn't mentioned seeking help or discussing a more balanced approach. However, his desire for family time isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the distribution of responsibilities is fair. If the wife is taking on her activities without reciprocating in the childcare during her absence, it might be a problem. But the husband's own refusal to go out suggests he's choosing family time, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the overall balance might need adjustment through better communication. Since the user is asking if he's the asshole, and the answer is \"No,\" because he's expressing valid feelings and the situation requires mutual adjustment rather than one-sided responsibility.\n"
