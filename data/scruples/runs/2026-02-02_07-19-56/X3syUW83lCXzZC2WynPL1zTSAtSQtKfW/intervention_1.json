Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's upset that his wife is spending 2-4 nights a week away from the kids, leaving him to handle everything. He's not a fan of going out on his own because he wants to spend time with the family when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has a long-standing hobby in dance, which she's maintained since childhood. She dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. Then there are additional nights for work meetings, dinners, or personal time like a massage. The husband, on the other hand, gets off work on Fridays and has the kids during the day. He's taking care of the kids on those dance nights and Saturdays when the wife is teaching.\n\nHe mentions that he doesn't want to go out, preferring family time when they're all together. The key points here are about balance and mutual understanding. The wife seems to have her own activities for mental well-being, and the husband feels overwhelmed or burdened with the childcare responsibilities. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's expressing frustration about the arrangement. But he's not refusing to take care of the kids; he's saying he's handling it but is annoyed because he feels it's unfair. The wife is contributing in her way by having her own activities, which she's entitled to. The husband's issue is more about wanting to have his own time as well. However, he doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together. That might be a point of contention. \n\nIs it reasonable for him to expect the wife to stay home more? Or is it fair for the wife to have her own activities, especially considering they both work full-time? The husband could be seen as not wanting to share responsibilities equally, but he's actually taking on the childcare when the wife is away. However, he's not contributing to her alone time by going out, which might be creating an imbalance. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important here. She might feel that her mental health is being supported by her activities, and she's trusting him to handle the kids. The husband's frustration is valid, but maybe he needs to communicate his feelings more effectively rather than framing it as the wife being the problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners having their own needs and activities is normal. However, if one side feels overburdened, it's a sign they need to adjust the arrangement. The husband's annoyance might stem from a lack of his own time, but he's choosing not to seek it out because he wants family time. That might not be his wife's fault. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? If he's not contributing to the other parent's time and instead is expecting the wife to adjust her schedule, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's not being considerate of her needs, perhaps he is. The key is whether his expectations are unreasonable. Since the wife is already providing her activities and he's handling the kids, maybe the husband's issue is more about his own expectations. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or societal norms about parental responsibilities. However, in most cases, mutual respect and communication are key. The husband's post suggests he's open to talking, but he's looking for validation. \n\nUltimately, the answer might swing towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's handling the kids when the wife is away, but he's also expressing a desire to have family time. The wife's activities are for her well-being. However, if the husband's frustration is about the balance of responsibilities, maybe the issue is more about communication and expectations rather than one person being wrong. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe the assumption is that the husband should be more flexible or understand that the wife's activities are important. Alternatively, the husband's desire for family time is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's managing the responsibilities when the wife is away and is seeking a balance. However, the wife's activities are also important for her well-being. It's a situation that needs better communication rather than one party being wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
