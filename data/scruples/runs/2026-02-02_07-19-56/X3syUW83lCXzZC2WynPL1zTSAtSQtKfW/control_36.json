Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's taking care of their two kids almost every night when his wife is out dancing, teaching, or attending social events. He's not upset about the dancing or her other activities per se, but he's frustrated because he doesn't want to go out and leave the kids to be alone with her. He values the family time when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is working full-time, dancing, teaching, and has her social activities. The husband also works full-time and has childcare duties on specific days. It seems like both are contributing, but maybe the distribution isn't equal. The husband is handling the kids on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and parts of Saturdays. That's a lot of nights. He's not asking for time off; he just wants the family time when they're together. He's not against his wife going out, but he feels it's unfair when he's left alone while she can go out. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that he can go out too, but he doesn't want to. He doesn't want to miss the rare moments they're all together. So the issue isn't about him not wanting to go out, but about the imbalance in who's left with the kids. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to spend time with the kids isn't a bad thing. It's normal for a parent to want to be there for their children. The wife's activities are for her mental health, which is also important. However, the husband is taking care of the kids a significant number of nights. If the wife is also doing things that require her to leave, but the husband isn't, that could be a point of contention. \n\nThe key here might be whether the husband is refusing to take any time for himself, but the post says he doesn't want to go out because he wants to be with the family. There's no indication he's being unreasonable about it. The wife suggesting he could go out if he wanted might imply she thinks he should have the option, but he's choosing not to. That's his choice. \n\nLooking at it from another angle, maybe the wife isn't covering her share of the childcare, especially on the nights she's out. If she's the one going out more often, then the husband's frustration is valid. The question is whether it's fair for him to feel that way. Since the wife is the one attending these events and the husband is staying with the kids, it's a matter of balancing their respective needs and contributions. \n\nThe husband isn't asking the wife to stop her activities, just expressing annoyance at being the one left with the kids. There's no indication he's being selfish or unreasonable. He's appreciative of her hobbies but feels the balance isn't even. So, the answer would depend on whether the husband's desire for family time is a legitimate concern or if he's being overly possessive. Given the information, it seems the author isn't in the wrong because he's not rejecting his wife's needs but is seeking a fair balance.\n"
