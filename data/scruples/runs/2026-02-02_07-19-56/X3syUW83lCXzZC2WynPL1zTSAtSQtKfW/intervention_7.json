Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The situation is that the wife dances and teaches on certain nights, and also has other social or work events. The author is handling childcare on those nights and also spends the day with the kids on Fridays and Saturdays. The wife suggests the author should go out some nights, but he prefers family time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the responsibilities. Both are working full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day. The author has Fridays off, so that's a full day with the kids. Then, the wife is dancing on Tuesday and Wednesday, not coming home, so the author takes care of the kids in the evenings. Saturday, he starts the day with the kids until she comes back around 2:30. Plus 1-2 other nights where she's away for work or social reasons. So in total, 3-4 nights a week plus a full day on Friday and part of Saturday. That does add up to a lot of time alone with the kids.\n\nThe author's concern is about being annoyed when the wife leaves them alone. The wife has her own reasons for needing that time, like mental health and hobbies. The author claims he doesn't want to leave the kids because family time is rare. But does that mean he's in the wrong? \n\nI should consider the balance here. The wife has her own needs and activities, which are important for her well-being. The father taking on the childcare when she's away is a valid contribution. However, the author is expressing annoyance, which could indicate they haven't discussed or balanced the workload properly. Maybe they need to find a middle ground. The author could also have a right to some personal time if he's feeling overwhelmed, but he's not asking for it, which might be an issue. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is choosing not to go out when the wife suggests. If he's not interested in going out and would rather spend time with the kids, is that unreasonable? The wife has her time, and he's filling in when she's away. However, it's possible he's not recognizing that the wife also needs her time. The question is whether his annoyance is justified. \n\nIn some perspectives, if the wife is contributing in her own way and the author is taking on the childcare without resentment, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the workload is too much and he's not communicating that, maybe he is. The wife might need her time to maintain her mental health, and the author is fulfilling his role by taking care of the kids. \n\nBut the author is the one who's annoyed, not the wife. The wife's needs are being met through her dancing and social activities, while the author is handling the kids. If he's not interested in personal time, maybe he's not the asshole. However, it's possible he's not being flexible or considering that the wife's time is important for her, and he could take some nights for himself without resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is okay with the arrangement and not annoyed, that's different. But since he is annoyed, the question is whether that's a valid concern. The father's role is important, but if he's not seeking balance or personal time, maybe he's not wrong. Alternatively, he might be expecting the wife to be available all the time, which is unrealistic. \n\nHmm. The answer could be either way, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on the given info. The author is handling a lot of childcare, but maybe the problem is that he's not wanting to take some nights for himself even though the wife is making time for her needs. The wife's suggestion is that he could go out, but he's resisting. That could be an issue because relationships require mutual support and understanding. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering that the wife's time is necessary and if he's not open to finding a middle ground where he can have some personal time as well. \n\nBut the author says he understands and appreciates her need to dance. So maybe his frustration is about the additional nights beyond that. The 1-2 nights for work dinners, etc., which might not be as essential as the dancing. However, the wife's work and social life are valid. The author is taking care of the kids, but maybe he's not acknowledging that she needs that time. If he's okay with the dancing nights but not the other 1-2, perhaps it's a matter of perspective. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is not voicing his needs to the wife, that's a problem. But he says he plans to talk to her. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is his annoyance. If the wife is doing her own thing and he's stepping up, but he's not happy about it, maybe that's his problem. The wife isn't making him do it; he's choosing to take care of the kids when she's away. \n\nSo, in terms of fairness, the wife has her own life and the author is handling the kids. The author might be in the wrong if he's expecting the wife to always stay home for his sake. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because the wife's activities are for her well-being and he's not being accommodating in return, even though he's taking care of the kids. The annoyance could be seen as him not being supportive of her needs, even if he's doing the childcare. But maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's fulfilling his role and the wife is doing her own thing. \n\nWait, the wife is doing her dancing and the author is taking care of the kids. If he's okay with that, maybe he's not wrong. But the 1-2 additional nights might be the issue. The problem is that the author is annoyed but not wanting to go out. If the annoyance is about the amount of time he's spending alone with the kids, but he's not trying to get out, maybe he's not the asshole. It's more about communication. Since he's planning to talk to his wife, maybe he's not wrong. But if the wife has her own needs and he's not compromising, maybe he is. \n\nI think the key here is that the wife is contributing to her mental health through dancing and social time, and the author is taking care of the kids. However, his annoyance might stem from feeling like he's carrying more responsibility. But since he's not asking for help, just expressing annoyance when the wife leaves, it's possible he's not in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if we consider that both have their own needs and he's fulfilling his role without being resentful. Wait, but he is annoyed. The question is whether he's the asshole for being annoyed. If the wife's activities are reasonable and he's not being unreasonable in not wanting to go out, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not being supportive of his wife's needs for self-care, even if he's doing the childcare. If the wife is doing something necessary for her mental health, and the author is not resented about that, but about the other nights, maybe he is being a bit selfish. The answer would be A. \n\nHmm. This is a bit of a toss-up. The wife's dancing is a long-standing hobby, and socializing is important. The author is handling childcare, but he's the one who's annoyed. If they have a good arrangement where the author can take care of the kids and the wife can take care of herself, maybe it's okay. But if the author is not voicing his own needs, that's a problem. However, he says he plans to talk to her. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's not considering that the wife's time for dancing and self-care is important, and his annoyance is unwarranted if he's okay with the setup. But if he's feeling overwhelmed, maybe B. Wait, but he's not saying he's overwhelmed, just annoyed. The key is that the wife is doing her own thing, and the author is handling the kids when she's away, which is a valid division. However, if he's not open to the wife having her own time and is annoyed about it, that's not fair. So maybe A is correct.\n"
