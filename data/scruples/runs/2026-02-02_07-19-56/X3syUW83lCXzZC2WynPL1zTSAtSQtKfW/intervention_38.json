Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The context is that the wife has a long-standing hobby and part-time activity in dance, which includes dancing two nights a week and teaching on Saturdays. They both work full-time, and the kids go to daycare during the day. The author gets Fridays off, so the kids are with him then. Additionally, there are 1-2 more nights where the wife is out for work-related events, friends, or a massage, making it 3-4 nights total where he's alone with the kids.\n\nThe author says he understands and appreciates her need for dancing for her well-being. His issue is with the other nights when she's out, leaving him alone. He mentions that he doesn't want to go out because when they're all together, he wants to enjoy family time. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about shared responsibilities and mutual expectations in a marriage. The wife has her commitments, which the author acknowledges. The author is taking care of the kids on specific days and nights, which he's okay with. But when she's out for other reasons, he's feeling like it's too much and he's not getting his own time. \n\nThe wife suggests that if he doesn't want to be alone, he could go out a few nights. But the author doesn't want to go out, which is personal preference. The problem might be in the communication and negotiation. The author says he plans to talk to his wife, which is good. But is there an imbalance in their responsibilities? \n\nThe author has specific days off (Fridays) and takes care of the kids then. He's also handling the kids on Saturday until 2:30. On top of that, 2-4 nights where he's alone. The wife is out for her own well-being and other commitments. The author's annoyance could stem from not feeling supported or from the workload. But he's not asking for more help; he's saying he doesn't want to be alone. The wife, however, might have her own needs and social activities. \n\nIt's important to consider if the author is expecting the wife to sacrifice her interests and social time just because he doesn't want to be alone. The wife's dancing is a long-standing hobby, and she's been doing it since childhood. Maybe there's a compromise they can find, but the author might be in the wrong if he's not contributing to his own time or if there's no discussion about how both can have time for themselves. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife's activities are increasing over time, the author could be right to express concern. But since he's taking on childcare duties when she's out, and he's choosing not to go out himself, perhaps it's his own choice to not use those nights for his own time. The wife is fulfilling her role, and the author's issue is with his own lack of personal time. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because he's not wanting to use the opportunities to have his own time and instead is expecting the wife to adjust her schedule. But maybe there's a balancing factor. The wife's activities are 3-4 nights a week, but the author is handling the kids then. However, he's also not going out, so maybe he's not contributing to the couple's time. But he's with the kids when she's out. The question is whether his annoyance is justified. \n\nAnother angle: the wife is working full-time and still managing her dance activities. The author is also working full-time but gets to spend time with the kids on Fridays and Saturdays. If the wife is out 3-4 nights, maybe the author's responsibility is manageable, but he's not happy with it. Since he's the one who doesn't want to go out, it's his own choice to not take that time. So he might be in the wrong for not wanting to reciprocate or for expecting her to stay in. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not addressing his own need for personal time and instead is focusing on the wife's activities. The wife is already making time for her mental health, and the author could find his own ways to have time, like using the days when he's with the kids for his own activities or negotiating how they handle nights out. He's not in the wrong for being the one who takes care of the kids, but maybe for not wanting to use the nights she's out as his own time to go out or relax without the kids. The fact that he's with the kids on Fridays and part of Saturdays could be his time to be with them, and when she's out 1-2 more nights, he could use that for himself. The wife's suggestion that he could go out a few nights is a valid point. If he doesn't want to go out, perhaps he's not recognizing that those nights are his to manage as he sees fit. His annoyance might be about his own lack of autonomy rather than the wife's actions. So, he's not wrong in feeling that way, but if he's not contributing to his own time, maybe he's in the wrong for not negotiating better or for not using the opportunities available to him.\n"
