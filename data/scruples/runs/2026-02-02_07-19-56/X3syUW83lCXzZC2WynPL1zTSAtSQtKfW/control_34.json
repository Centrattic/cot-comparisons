Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The key points here are about the division of childcare responsibilities and personal needs.\n\nFirst, the wife has her own activities: dancing, teaching, and social events. She's doing these for her mental health, which is valid. The husband is handling childcare multiple nights a week and weekends. He's not the one asking for time off; he's just doing what's necessary when she's away. He mentions that he doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together. \n\nThe wife suggests he should go out, but he doesn't feel like it. The question is whether his wanting to spend time with the family when he's not alone is unreasonable. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both need personal time. The wife is getting hers, but the husband is doing all the childcare. However, he's not complaining about the childcare itself, just that he's not getting time to himself. But he's not asking for a divorce or to not take care of the kids; he's just conflicted about not having his own time. \n\nThe wife's activities are for her well-being, which is important. The husband's desire for personal time is also valid. The issue might be communication. They need to discuss how to balance their needs. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. He's not refusing to take care of the kids; he's just expressing a need for personal time. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because his feelings are valid and he's not avoiding responsibility. He's just asking for balance, which is reasonable.\n"
