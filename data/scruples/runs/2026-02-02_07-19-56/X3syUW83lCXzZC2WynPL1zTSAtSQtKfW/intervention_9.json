Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author is a husband who is upset that his wife is away 2-4 nights a week, leaving him alone with the kids. He's not opposed to her dancing or her other activities, but he's annoyed because he doesn't want to go out and they don't get time together. The wife offers that he could go out, but he doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has a long-standing hobby (dancing from age 5) and it's important for her well-being. She's working full-time, and the husband also works full-time but has Fridays off. The kids are in daycare during the day, but on Fridays, they stay with him. On dance nights (Tue/Wed) and Saturday, he takes care of the kids. Plus 1-2 other nights for her work-related or social events.\n\nThe author's main issue is not the childcare per se, but that he doesn't want to be alone with the kids and the wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers family time. So the question is whether his annoyance is justified.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife is engaging in activities important to her mental health and she's been doing it for a long time. The husband is handling the childcare, which is a significant responsibility. However, he's not asking for help with the kids; he's more upset about the lack of time together. The wife is offering that he could go out, but he doesn't want to. So the issue is about his personal desire for family time versus her needs.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support and understanding are key. The author appreciates her dancing but is now annoyed because he's left alone more. The wife's activities are not unreasonable. If the husband truly values family time, maybe he should adjust his expectations or find ways to have time with the kids during their time together. However, expecting the wife to stop her activities just because he doesn't want to be alone might not be fair. The author might be in the wrong if he's not contributing to the solution (like taking turns, using childcare, etc.) and is instead expecting the wife to change her habits. But if the wife is also available on other nights, maybe it's a matter of communication. The author's stance that he doesn't want to go out and prefers family time could be valid, but he's not in the wrong if he's not forcing his wife to give up her needs. Maybe the real issue is unmet needs on both sides needing discussion. The answer depends on whether his annoyance is about the childcare or the lack of family time. Since he's okay with the childcare but annoyed because they don't get time together, it's more about his own desires. The wife has a valid reason for her activities. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but he should communicate better. However, if he's not contributing to solutions beyond just expressing annoyance, that's where he might be in the wrong. But the question is whether he is in the wrong for being annoyed. Since both have responsibilities and needs, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the husband is not helping with the childcare but is upset about missing time with the wife, that's a different angle. Wait, no, he's taking care of the kids. So maybe it's not about the childcare but about the lack of time with the wife. The wife is away, and he's not using the time to have fun but to be with the kids. So his annoyance is about missing the wife. However, the wife is engaging in activities important to her. It's a balance. In that case, the author's position might be reasonable, but not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
