Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. They have two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. On top of that, there are 1-2 more nights when she's out for work-related stuff or socializing.\n\nThe husband does the childcare on these nights and weekends. He says he's not upset about the dancing or her needing it for her well-being. But he's annoyed because when she suggests he could go out a few nights, he doesn't want to leave the kids. He values the family time they have when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. Both are working full-time. The wife's schedule includes these activities that she's had since childhood, which is part of her mental health. The husband is taking on a lot of childcare during these nights. It's not that he's complaining about the dancing, but the additional nights when she's away. \n\nHe mentions that when she suggests he could go out, he doesn't want to. So maybe there's an expectation that he should be okay with leaving the kids, but he doesn't feel like he wants to. The key here might be communication. They've talked about it, and she insists he could go out, but he's not interested. \n\nIs it fair for him to feel this way? Well, taking care of young kids on multiple nights and weekends is a significant responsibility. If he's not getting time for himself and is handling all the childcare during those nights, it's understandable that he might feel overwhelmed. However, the wife's activities are part of her well-being too. \n\nThe question is whether his feelings are valid. He's not necessarily wrong for feeling that way, but maybe there's a lack of mutual understanding or compromise. The wife might need to adjust her schedule, or they could find a middle ground. But since the husband is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to leave the kids, the answer would depend on whether his feelings are reasonable. \n\nIn many cases, both partners should have time for themselves. However, given the young age of the children and the husband's willingness to take care of them when she's out, maybe it's a bit unfair if he's doing all the work. But he's not entirely wrong either because he's also not going out, which could be a point of contention. The lack of balance in their social time might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing a valid need for family time, and the situation might require better communication and compromise rather than one party being in the wrong.\n"
