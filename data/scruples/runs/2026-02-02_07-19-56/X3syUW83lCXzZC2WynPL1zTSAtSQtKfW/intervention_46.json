Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's feeling overwhelmed because his wife is away 2-4 nights a week, leaving him to take care of the kids alone. The wife has her dance classes and teaching, plus some social events. The author doesn't want to go out and prefers family time when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has her own interests and activities, which are important for her mental health. She's working full-time, dancing, teaching, and still manages to have these activities. The husband is also working full-time, handling the kids on his day off and during her absence. He's not asking for a solution but is frustrated about the arrangement.\n\nThe key points here are balance and communication. The husband mentions he's going to talk to his wife, which is good. But is he in the wrong? Well, taking care of two young kids alone multiple times a week is a lot, but he's willing to do it. The issue is he's annoyed that she's not there. However, the wife is contributing in her own way, and the husband's preference for family time isn't inherently wrong. But maybe he's not considering that the wife's activities are necessary for her well-being too.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not asking for help, just expressing frustration. The problem might be that he's expecting his wife to stay home more, but she has her own needs. It's a shared responsibility, and they might need to adjust their expectations. If he's not interested in going out, maybe they can find other ways to spend time together. However, the author isn't refusing to take care of the kids; he's just annoyed. The question is whether his annoyance makes him the asshole.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). Both partners have valid needs. The wife needs her time for hobbies and socializing, and the husband wants quality family time. The real issue might be communication and finding a middle ground, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for his feelings. However, some might argue that he should be more understanding of her needs. But since he's open to talking and not demanding she change her habits, he's not the asshole.\n"
