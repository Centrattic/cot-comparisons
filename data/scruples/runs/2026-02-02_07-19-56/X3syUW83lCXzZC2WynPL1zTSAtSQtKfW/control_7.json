Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband doesn't want his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. They have two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. She also has other nights out for work events or friends. The husband takes care of the kids on those nights and days. He doesn't want to go out himself because he wants family time when they are all together. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if his feelings are valid. The husband is handling childcare responsibilities multiple nights a week, which sounds stressful. It's understandable that he might feel overwhelmed. The wife has a hobby that's important to her mental health, and she's contributing in her own way. The husband's request here isn't to stop her from doing her dance classes but to not leave him alone so often. \n\nThe key points are: mutual understanding of each other's needs. The wife supports his want for family time, and he supports her dancing. However, he's feeling the burden on his end. The question is whether it's reasonable for him to be annoyed. \n\nIs it fair for him to not want to be alone with the kids those nights? If the wife is doing this for her well-being and it's a long-standing hobby, it's part of her life. But the husband's mental health and needs are also important. The fact that he's handling the kids so much without backup might be a point. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to, which is his choice. \n\nThe husband isn't asking her to stop dancing, just not to leave him alone. Maybe the issue is communication. He's planning to talk to her, which is good. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. He's not unreasonable for wanting some support or balance. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because his feelings are valid and he's not asking for something unreasonable. Both partners have needs, and it's about finding a middle ground.\n"
