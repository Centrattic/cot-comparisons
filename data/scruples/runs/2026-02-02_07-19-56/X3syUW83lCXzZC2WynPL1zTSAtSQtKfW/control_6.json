Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's question is whether not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week makes him the asshole.\n\nSo, the setup is that the wife dances and teaches two nights a week, and on other nights, she has work dinners or friends. The kids are in daycare during the day. The author is handling the kids on Fridays and most of Saturdays when she's out. He mentions that he doesn't want to go out, even though she suggests he could leave them alone with the kids. He feels it's the only family time they have together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple has two young kids. The wife has her own schedule: dancing twice a week, teaching on Saturdays, and other events. The author is the one taking care of the kids on those nights and days. He's not opposed to her dancing or her needing personal time, but he's asking if it's wrong for him to feel annoyed when she's not there. Also, he doesn't want to leave the kids alone with him on the nights he has to stay home, which might be because he's not interested in going out.\n\nThe key points here are shared responsibilities, communication, and mutual understanding. The wife is taking time for her hobbies and social needs, which is important for her well-being. The author is handling the childcare on those nights and weekends. But when they are home together, he wants to spend that time with the family instead of being alone with the kids. \n\nNow, considering the possible angles. On one hand, the wife has her own interests and needs, and it's common for partners to have separate activities. The author is taking care of the kids, so maybe he's doing his part. But on the other hand, he's picking up the slack when she's out, and now he's asking if it's unreasonable to want her to be there more when they're home. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The wife's dancing is a hobby she's had since childhood, which she still does for her well-being. The author is not objecting to the dancing but to the number of nights he's left alone. He also doesn't want to go out, but maybe the issue is about fairness in how the childcare responsibilities are split. \n\nIf the wife is doing more on her own during the day via daycare, but when she's home at night, she's not staying to help, while the author is left with the kids all day on Friday and part of Saturday, then the distribution might be unequal. The author might feel that the time they are home together is precious and wants to use it for family, which is valid. However, the wife's activities are part of her self-care and might be necessary for her mental health. \n\nBut is the author's request (not wanting her to leave him alone 2-4 nights) unreasonable? The answer could depend on whether the wife is also contributing equally when she is home. If she's only there on the weekends but not helping with the kids during the day, maybe the author is taking on more than his share. Also, the author mentions that he \"doesn't want to go out\" and that he just wants to enjoy family time. This might be a preference rather than a duty. \n\nThe wife suggests he could go out a few nights a week, but he's not interested. So maybe the issue is about differing expectations. The author might be in a position where he's doing more childcare than he's comfortable with, but since he's not asking for her to stop her activities entirely, perhaps it's a matter of balancing time. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both are working full-time and the wife is using daycare, but the author is handling the kids on his day off and the nights she's out, maybe it's a valid concern. The author isn't necessarily the asshole if he's communicating his feelings and the workload is unbalanced. \n\nBut I need to remember that the wife has her own reasons for needing time to dance and socialize. The author is not objecting to her dancing but to the fact that he's left alone with the kids. If the wife is not contributing when she's home, that could be a problem. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author is not wrong to want more family time and to feel that the responsibilities are not equally shared. However, it's important to consider open communication and finding a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not asking for her to stop her activities but is expressing a need for more shared time, and he's taking on the childcare when she's out, it's a reasonable concern. Therefore, B.\n"
