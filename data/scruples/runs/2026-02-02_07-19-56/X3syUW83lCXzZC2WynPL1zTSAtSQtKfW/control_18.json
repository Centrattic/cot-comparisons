Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants to know if they're being unreasonable for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays, plus there are 1-2 other nights where she's out for work or social events. The husband gets Fridays off and takes care of the kids then, and also on Saturday mornings until the wife comes home. So, the husband is handling the kids multiple days a week, and he's not happy about it. \n\nThe wife says he could go out and leave the kids with her, but he doesn't want to. He just wants to spend time with the family when they're all home. The question is whether this makes him the asshole (ITA).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The wife has her own activities for her well-being, which is important. The husband is taking care of the kids a lot, but he's not asking for more help, just not wanting her to leave him alone. He mentions he doesn't want to go out because family time is rare. \n\nIs he being selfish? Maybe. The wife is contributing in her way, and he's handling the kids on other days. But having young kids is a lot, and it's normal for both parents to need some personal time. If the husband is doing most of the childcare and not wanting to take on more, maybe he's justified. However, the fact that he's not asking to go out but just not wanting her to leave might be a point. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has her own reasons for needing time. But the husband is also entitled to his needs. Maybe the issue is more about communication and balance. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the setup, he's not necessarily wrong. He's expressing his feelings about the situation. The key is that both need time, and it's about finding a middle ground. So, answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
