Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The setup is that they both work full-time, have two young kids, and the wife has her own hobbies and commitments. The husband feels overwhelmed when she's away those nights and days, but he doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nFirst, the wife's dancing and teaching are part of her mental well-being. That's important. She's also working full-time, so her schedule is packed. The husband is handling the kids on his own multiple nights a week, including a full day on Fridays and Saturdays. He's not asking her to stop her activities, just expressing that he's annoyed when she's not there.\n\nHe mentions he plans to talk to her, which is good. The key point is whether his annoyance is justified. Is it unreasonable to want his wife to be around more? The wife is contributing by taking care of the kids on other days, like when he's working. But the husband's main issue is the time alone, not necessarily her activities. He doesn't want to go out, so he's not seeking respite. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the husband is being honest about his feelings, and it's valid to feel overwhelmed. However, the wife's activities are part of her personal needs. The situation might require compromise. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's not asking her to stop her hobbies and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's annoyed without wanting to reciprocate by going out could mean he's not sharing the load equally. Or maybe it's just a matter of differing priorities. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners have their own needs. The husband's desire for family time is valid, but he might need to consider the wife's needs. However, the wife is already handling other responsibilities. The answer might depend on whether the husband's frustration is reasonable. Since he's the one taking care of the kids those nights, maybe it's okay for him to feel that way. But if the wife is also contributing in other ways, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's being selfish by not wanting to go out. But he's not asked to go out; he's just staying home. It's a balance. The answer could be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and it's part of a normal relationship dynamic where both have different needs. But if he's not considering the wife's perspective fully, maybe A. Hmm. I think it's more balanced. Since he's not making demands, just sharing his feelings, and it's a realistic situation with two working parents, the answer might be B.\n"
