Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that his wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other events. He's taking care of the kids on those nights and weekends, and he's not interested in going out even when his wife suggests he could. He feels it's a lot and wants to spend time with the family when they're together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which are important for her well-being. The author is handling the kids on those nights, which is a significant responsibility. But is he in the wrong for being annoyed?\n\nWell, the author is taking care of the kids solo multiple nights a week. That's a lot of work. It's reasonable for him to feel overwhelmed. However, the wife is also working full-time and has her own needs. The key here is balance. The author is not refusing to help or being resentful, but he's expressing that he's tired of it and wants more family time. \n\nThe wife's suggestion that he could go out is met with his preference to stay home, which is valid. He's not being selfish, just expressing a desire for family time. The fact that he's open to talking to her shows he's trying to communicate. The issue is whether his feelings are justified. Since he's the one handling the kids most nights and weekends, it's not unreasonable for him to feel this way. So the answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
