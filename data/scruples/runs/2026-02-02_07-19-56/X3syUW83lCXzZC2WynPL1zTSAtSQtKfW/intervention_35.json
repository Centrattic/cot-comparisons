Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a husband who's asking if it's his fault for being annoyed when his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturday, and sometimes has other commitments. The husband is taking care of the kids during these times and feels overwhelmed, but he doesn't want to go out on his own. He's worried he's being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both work full-time, so they have similar responsibilities. The wife's dance activities are part of her mental health, which is important. She's also covering some nights when she's not dancing. The husband is handling the kids alone on those nights and on Fridays and Saturdays. But he doesn't want to leave the kids to go out. \n\nThe key points here are balance and communication. The husband is taking on a significant role in childcare, which is good, but he's feeling overwhelmed. The wife is maintaining her hobbies and social life, which is also necessary for her well-being. The question is whether the husband's feelings are valid or if he's being selfish.\n\nThe author's concern is about not wanting to go out, but maybe the problem is that he's not considering the wife's needs. They've already discussed it, and she suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. That might mean he's not open to finding a middle ground. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is crucial. The husband is contributing a lot by caring for the kids, but he's also not allowing himself some time, which might lead to burnout. The wife is asserting her need for personal time, which is healthy. The author might be in the wrong if he's not recognizing that both partners need some time for themselves. \n\nBut maybe he's not wrong either. If the wife's time away is causing him significant stress, he should express that. However, since he's not interested in going out, maybe the issue is about communication and finding a solution that works for both. The answer hinges on whether his annoyance is justified or if he's expecting the wife to cover more than she can. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering that his wife's activities are necessary for her mental health and he's not finding a compromise. He's focused on his own annoyance without addressing the balance in their responsibilities.\n"
