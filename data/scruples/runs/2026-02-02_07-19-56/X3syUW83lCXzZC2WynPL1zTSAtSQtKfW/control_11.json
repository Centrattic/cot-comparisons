Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances and teaches twice a week, which the author is okay with. But there are additional nights where she's out for work events, friends, or a massage. So in total, 3-4 nights a week he's alone with the kids. He's not against him going out, but he doesn't want to because when they are together, he wants to spend time with the family.\n\nHmm. The author mentions that he's taking care of the kids on those nights, which includes dinner, baths, bedtime, and on Saturdays handling the morning routine. He says it's not a big deal, but also that it's 3-4 nights a week, which is a lot. He's not complaining about the dancing part, but the extra nights. His wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to stay home. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, communication is key here. He says he plans to talk to his wife, which is good. But the question is whether his feelings are justified. The wife has her own activities for mental health, and the kids are in daycare during the day. The author is handling the kids on specific nights, but he's not asking for anything unreasonable. He's not refusing to take care of them, but he's expressing annoyance because of the frequency. \n\nI think it's about shared responsibility and mutual respect. If the wife is contributing during the day (like teaching on Saturday mornings when he's with the kids), maybe the author's workload is heavier. However, the wife is using her own time for activities that are important to her. The author might feel overwhelmed, but he's not wrong for needing more family time. It's a balance. The problem is that he's not going out, but he's left with all the responsibilities. \n\nThe main issue isn't that he doesn't want her to leave, but that the arrangement isn't balanced. If both partners are working full-time and the wife is using her work time to have these activities, but the author is shouldering all the childcare. But he does take care of the kids when she's away. It's possible that the wife could adjust her schedule or they could find a middle ground. However, the author's preference to be with the family when they're together is valid. So he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
