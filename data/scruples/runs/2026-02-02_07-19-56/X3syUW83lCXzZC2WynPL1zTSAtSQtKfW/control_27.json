Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband feeling overwhelmed because his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances and teaches dance, which takes up her time, and there are also other nights she has work events or social plans.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions that he's willing to talk to his wife but wants a reality check. Both work full-time and have daycare during the day. He takes care of the kids on Fridays when they don't go to daycare and on Saturdays after his wife's classes. Plus, there are 1-2 other nights where the wife isn't home. The husband says he doesn't want to go out because he wants family time. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The wife has a hobby (dancing) that she does for her mental health. The husband is taking on a significant share of childcare, which is a lot, especially with two young kids. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's managing a lot of responsibilities alone multiple times a week. It's understandable to feel that he's shouldering more than his fair share. The wife is doing activities that are important to her, but maybe they need to find a balance. However, the husband doesn't want to go out; he just wants to be home with the family. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, people need personal time and hobbies, and the wife's dancing is part of her well-being. If both parents are working, splitting childcare responsibilities is typical. The husband is taking care of the kids on Fridays and part of Saturdays, plus other nights. However, the wife is also contributing in her own way. It's possible that the husband's resentment is valid because he's handling a lot alone. But since he admitted he doesn't want to go out, maybe he's not sharing the load equally. \n\nWait, but the wife is suggesting that he could go out a few nights. If he doesn't want to, that's his choice. But maybe he's expecting her to stay home more to share the childcare. The problem is that he's not in the wrong for wanting support, but perhaps he's not articulating his needs effectively. However, the core issue is the division of labor. The husband is doing a lot, and the wife is doing her own things. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is doing something important for herself (dancing for mental health), and the husband is handling the kids on those nights, that's a trade-off. But if the husband is feeling overwhelmed, it's reasonable to discuss adjusting schedules. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe husband isn't denying her the right to have hobbies or social time; he's just expressing that he's shouldering more childcare. The wife is also working full-time. It's a common issue in dual-income households. Unless there's a clear imbalance where one partner is taking on way more than the other, it's hard to say. The husband is handling 3-4 nights a week, but maybe the wife is handling other nights. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband's feelings are valid. Since he's not in the wrong for wanting to spend time with the family and not wanting to be alone with the kids all the time, but he's not necessarily wrong because he's not refusing to take care of them. The answer would depend on whether the division of responsibilities is fair. If the wife is doing her own things and the husband is handling specific nights, maybe it's a matter of communication rather than one being wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his need for balance and support, which is valid. However, if the wife's dancing is a necessary part of her mental health, then it's a mutual adjustment point. But since the husband is the one feeling the burden, he's not in the wrong for being annoyed and seeking support. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
