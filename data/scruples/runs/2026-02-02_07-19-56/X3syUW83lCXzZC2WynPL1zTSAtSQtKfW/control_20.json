Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that his wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturday. Additionally, she has other commitments like work dinners or friends. He takes care of the kids alone those nights and on Fridays and Saturdays when the kids are with him. He doesn't want to go out because he wants family time, but he's annoyed when his wife leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are working full-time, the kids are in daycare during the day except Friday. The author handles the kids on those nights when his wife is busy. He says he's not against her activities but feels overwhelmed. The wife suggests he should go out, but he prefers family time.\n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibilities and mutual understanding. The wife has her hobbies and social needs, which are important for her well-being. The author is taking on childcare duties without complaints but feels it's unbalanced. Is it fair to expect him to handle all the childcare while she has her time? Or is it reasonable for him to want more family time together?\n\nThe author isn't refusing to talk to his wife, which is a good step. He's trying to find a middle ground. The question is whether his feelings are valid. Since both parents are working, maybe they need to split responsibilities differently. However, the author is handling the kids on specific days and nights, which might be a fair arrangement given his schedule (Friday off). The wife's additional 1-2 nights could add up, but maybe that's part of their normal routine.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling annoyed? Probably not. He's expressing his needs and trying to communicate. The wife's activities are important to her, but the author's desire for family time is also valid. There's no clear wrong here; it's more about balancing both their needs. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not being unreasonable, just seeking a balance.\n"
