Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has 1-2 other nights where she's out for work or social events. The husband is handling all the childcare during these nights and on Fridays and Saturdays. He doesn't mind the dancing part because he appreciates her need for it, but he's upset that she leaves him alone 3-4 nights a week. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about balance, mutual respect, and shared responsibilities. The wife is working full-time and has her hobbies and social activities, which are important for her well-being. The husband is also working full-time and taking on extra childcare duties. However, the issue seems to be the husband's frustration with the amount of time he's alone with the kids. \n\nIs it fair for him to feel this way? Well, both partners have their own responsibilities and needs. The wife might need her time for dance and socializing, which is healthy. The husband might feel overwhelmed, but he's willing to talk about it. The fact that he's seeking a reality check before talking to his wife shows he's trying to approach this thoughtfully. \n\nThe question is whether his feelings are valid. Since he's handling childcare so much, maybe there's a need for more shared responsibility. However, the wife is also contributing by handling the kids on other days. The husband's main issue isn't the tasks themselves but the fact that she's not there. It's possible that he's feeling isolated or that he's missing family time. But since they have a day (Friday) where the kids are with him and other days when the wife is present, maybe his request isn't unreasonable. \n\nBut is he in the wrong for not wanting to go out? If he doesn't want to leave the kids, that's his choice. However, expecting the wife to stay home more might not consider her needs. The balance here is tricky. The husband isn't denying the wife's hobbies, just expressing his own need for family time. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners have some needs that might conflict. The key is communication and finding a middle ground. Since the husband is open to talking, he's not being unreasonable. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings without dismissing her needs, and it's a common issue in couples with differing priorities.\n"
