Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a husband who's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, some context: The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife has been dancing since she was 5, which is a hobby she continues. She dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. Both work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day. The husband gets Fridays off, so the kids stay with him on those days. On other days, the wife is out for work dinners, meetings, or social events, leading to the husband taking care of the kids alone 3-4 nights a week.\n\nThe wife suggests that the husband could go out a few nights a week, but he doesn't want to because he values the time they have together as a family when they're all home. The husband is frustrated but is considering talking to his wife, and he's asking for a reality check.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's opinion is that he is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLooking at the wife's side: She has a long-standing hobby (dancing) and a job. She's working full-time, dancing, teaching, and attending work events. It's reasonable for her to have some personal time for her well-being. Also, she's contributing by working, which helps support the family. Her leaving the kids with the husband might be necessary for her to manage her stress or maintain her mental health.\n\nOn the husband's side: He's handling the childcare alone multiple nights a week, which is a significant responsibility, especially with a 6-month-old. He's not against his wife having her time, but he's expressing that he doesn't want to go out and that he values family time. His frustration seems to come from feeling overwhelmed or maybe resentful about the imbalance in childcare responsibilities.\n\nBut wait, the wife is also working full-time. The husband's schedule allows him to have Fridays off, so he's taking care of the kids then. However, the other days, when she's out, he's left alone with them. The key point here is whether the husband's expectation is reasonable. He's not in a position to go out, which is understandable if he's already managing the kids alone. The wife's suggestion that he could go out might be based on the idea of shared responsibility, but if he's already handling the childcare alone, it's possible she's not considering the full picture.\n\nAnother angle: The husband is not objecting to the wife's activities per se, but the impact on his time. He's okay with her dancing and her needing time, but he's not getting time for himself. The problem here is the balance of responsibilities. If the wife is out 2-4 nights, he's the sole caregiver, which might lead to burnout. It's a common issue in parenting where one parent feels overburdened. The wife's suggestion that he could go out might not account for the fact that when he's home, he's already managing alone. So maybe the wife isn't aware of how much he's handling.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Probably not. He's expressing his needs and not wanting to add more to his plate. The wife's activities are part of her self-care, which is important. However, the husband's needs are valid too. The issue might be a communication problem rather than one party being in the wrong. The husband's AITA post is seeking validation, but the reality is that both partners need to find a balance. The wife might be contributing in other ways (like working), but if the husband is shouldering the childcare, that's an issue. The author might not be in the wrong because he's voicing his legitimate concern about the imbalance.\n"
