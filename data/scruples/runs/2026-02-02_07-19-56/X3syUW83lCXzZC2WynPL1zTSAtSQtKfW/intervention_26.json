Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author describes a situation where his wife is away for those nights, but he doesn't want to go out and prefers family time. He mentions that he's taking care of the kids on those nights and weekends, which he's okay with, but he's frustrated because he feels like he's the one handling everything and he's not getting any alone time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities in the relationship. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which is important for her well-being. The husband is taking care of the kids during these times, which is a significant responsibility. However, he's also choosing not to leave the kids with her so he can have time to himself, which suggests he might not want to take on that responsibility every night. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and compromise. The husband says he appreciates her need for dance, but he's also expressing his own need for family time. However, if he's the one handling the kids on the nights she's away, but doesn't want to leave them with her even when she's home, that might be a problem. It could indicate that he's not comfortable with her being the primary caregiver on those other nights, which might be an issue of trust or workload distribution.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The husband mentions he plans to talk to his wife, which is good. But maybe the problem is that he's expecting her to adjust her schedule to his preferences without considering her own needs. The wife's activities are important for her mental health, so if the husband is the one who's handling the kids every night she's away, but also doesn't want to leave them with her when he's home, that could be an imbalance.\n\nAlso, the husband's statement that he doesn't want to go out because when they're all home together, he wants to enjoy family time. That's understandable, but if his wife is contributing to the household by working and having her own activities, maybe there's an expectation of shared responsibility. The husband might be taking on more childcare than he's comfortable with, but if he's not delegating to her when he's home, that's a problem.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should have some time for themselves. The wife's activities are legitimate, but the husband's need for personal time is also valid. The issue might be that he's not finding a middle ground. Perhaps he could take on some nights and she others, or they could arrange for external help once in a while. However, the husband's stance is that he doesn't want to leave the kids with her, which might be a red flag. Why is he uncomfortable with that? Is it because he doesn't trust her, or is he just so used to handling it himself?\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's not allowing his wife to take on her share of the childcare responsibilities when he's home, which could be a form of unfair delegation. He's expecting her to handle the kids when she's not working or dancing, but he's not willing to let her do that, which might be creating an imbalance. It's important for both partners to share responsibilities equally and respect each other's needs without one person feeling overburdened.\n"
