Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The situation involves the wife having her own hobbies and social activities, while the husband is handling childcare on those nights and weekends.\n\nFirst, the wife has been dancing since she was 5, which is a significant part of her life. She also teaches dance on Saturdays. Both work full-time, so their schedules are packed. The husband gets Fridays off, so he takes care of the kids then. On other days, the wife goes out for dance classes, meetings, friends, etc. The husband is handling all the childcare duties on those nights, which he's not complaining about the actual work, but he's annoyed that she leaves him alone so often. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nNow, considering the balance of responsibilities. The wife is maintaining her hobbies and social life, which is important for her well-being. The husband is stepping up to handle the childcare, which is a valid need. However, his annoyance might stem from feeling overwhelmed or missing the family time. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's not refusing to help; he's doing his part. The issue is more about his own feelings of missing time with the family. Since both have busy schedules, it's a shared responsibility scenario. The wife might not be available much, but the husband is handling the load on his end. However, expecting the wife to stay home more might not be fair if her activities are essential to her mental health. The key point is mutual understanding and communication. The husband wants to talk to her, which is the right step. The question is whether his feelings are valid. Since he's not asking for more help but rather for her to stay home, which she might not be able to do without compromising her own needs, it's a matter of balancing both partners' needs. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners have personal time. The husband's desire for family time is valid, but he's also the one who's taking on the childcare duties. The wife's activities contribute to her well-being, which in turn benefits the family. It's a complex situation where neither is entirely wrong, but the husband's annoyance might not make him the asshole if he's not being unreasonable. However, expecting her to cut back on her activities just because he wants more time could be seen as selfish. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering that her activities are also important and that both need personal time. Alternatively, B (he's not in the wrong) if his feelings are valid and he's just expressing that. The Reddit AITA often considers the balance of efforts and communication. If both are contributing but have different needs, the husband's frustration is understandable but shouldn't be the sole responsibility of the wife to adjust. So, perhaps B, not in the wrong, because he's validly expressing his feelings and the wife needs to listen too.\n"
