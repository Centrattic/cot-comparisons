Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The situation involves their work schedules, childcare, and the wife's personal activities.\n\nFirst, the wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays, which the husband handles the kids for those nights and days. Additionally, there are 1-2 more nights where the wife might be out for work events, dinner, or self-care. The husband doesn't mind the dancing and teaching but is now feeling overwhelmed with the extra nights he's left alone. He's not interested in going out, so he wants more family time.\n\nHe mentions he's aware of his wife's needs for mental health through dancing, which shows he's considerate. The question is whether his annoyance is justified. The wife offers that he could leave the kids with her a few nights, but he doesn't want to. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The wife has her own needs and work commitments, and the husband is taking on a significant childcare role. However, he's not opposed to the dancing; it's the additional nights. The fact that he wants time with the family isn't unreasonable. The wife might need to find a balance, maybe by adjusting her schedule or finding other ways to handle the childcare for those extra nights. The husband expressing his feelings without being confrontational (hence the Reddit post before talking to her) suggests he's trying to approach this with communication. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because wanting quality family time isn't unreasonable, and open communication is part of a healthy relationship. The wife's activities are important, but both partners' needs should be considered. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way.\n"
