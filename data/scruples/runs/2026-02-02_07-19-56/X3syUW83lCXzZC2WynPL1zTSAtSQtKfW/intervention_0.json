Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's handling childcare duties several nights a week while his wife dances, teaches, and goes out with friends. The husband says he doesn't want to leave the kids alone with her so he can go out because he wants to spend time with the family when they're all together. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the responsibilities. The wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has 1-2 other nights out. The husband handles the kids on those nights and also takes care of them on Fridays (when he's off) and Saturdays. The wife suggests he could leave the kids with her to go out, but he prefers to stay and be with the family.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's taking on a lot of childcare duties, which can be exhausting. He's not asking for anything unreasonable, just to enjoy family time when they're all together. On the other hand, the wife has her own interests and needs, which are important too. The key here might be balance and communication. \n\nThe husband mentions he's going to talk to his wife, which is good. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The wife is participating in activities that are important for her well-being, and it's reasonable for her to want some personal time. However, the husband feeling overwhelmed is also valid. \n\nIf the husband isn't contributing in other ways or if there's an imbalance in other areas, that could be a problem. But from the given info, he's handling the kids on those nights and also has the daytime responsibilities. The wife's suggestion for him to go out implies she's willing to take over, but he's not interested. \n\nIs it wrong to prefer family time over going out? Not necessarily. But if the husband is feeling resentful or overburdened without addressing other areas where they can balance responsibilities, maybe. However, the scenario doesn't indicate other imbalances. The husband is clear he wants to be with the family, which is a valid choice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends. If the wife is also handling her share during other times and the husband's request isn't unreasonable, then maybe not. But if the husband's needs aren't being considered, he might need to express that. However, the question is whether he's the asshole. The answer might be no because he's not being unreasonable in wanting to spend time with his family when they're all together. The wife has her own activities, but the husband's choice to stay isn't inherently wrong. \n\nBut wait, the husband is the one handling the kids multiple nights a week. If he's not feeling supported, maybe he should communicate that better. However, the scenario says he's aware of the situation and isn't asking for anything else but to be with the family when possible. The wife is already going out 3-4 nights, which might be a lot, but the husband's not objecting to her activities. The conflict is about him not wanting to leave the kids with her so he can go out. \n\nI think the key is that both partners have valid needs. The husband isn't wrong for prioritizing family time. The wife isn't wrong for needing her own time. The issue might be in finding a middle ground. Since the husband isn't imposing on the wife's time but is choosing his own, he might not be in the wrong. So answer B: No.\n"
