Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author mentions that his wife has hobbies and social activities, which he supports, but he's feeling overwhelmed with the childcare responsibilities. He's not against his wife going out, but he's annoyed because he ends up handling everything and doesn't get time for himself. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is working full-time, dancing, teaching, and attending social events. The husband is also working full-time and is handling childcare when she's out. He has Friday off, so that's a day he's with the kids. On other days, he's managing the kids when she leaves. He's not going out because he wants family time. \n\nThe key points are: both have full-time jobs, the kids are in daycare during the day but not on Fridays. The wife's activities leave him with the kids a few nights a week. He's not opposed to her going out, but he's frustrated about the childcare load and not getting time for himself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not denying his wife her needs, but he's expressing his own needs. It's possible that the division of childcare responsibilities is uneven. However, the wife might be contributing in other ways, like during the day or on other days. The husband's request for time to himself isn't unreasonable. \n\nBut the question is whether he's the asshole. Since he's acknowledging her needs and isn't trying to control her activities, but is asking for some time off, maybe he's not wrong. However, if the agreement is that he handles the kids when she's out, maybe he should be okay with it. But it's possible that the load is too much, and he deserves some time as well. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the responsibilities are shared fairly. If the wife is doing her part during the day and weekends, maybe the husband's complaints are valid. But if he's handling most of the childcare in the evenings, he might be overburdened. The fact that he doesn't want to go out is because he wants family time, which is understandable. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often looks at mutual respect and fairness. The author isn't being unreasonable in asking for some time to himself. Since he's doing most of the childcare when his wife is out, it's reasonable to want some balance. So the answer might be B (No), meaning he's not in the wrong.\n"
