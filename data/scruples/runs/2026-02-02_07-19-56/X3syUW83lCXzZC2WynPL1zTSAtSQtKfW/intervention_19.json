Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeling that his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week, and he's questioning if he's being unreasonable for not wanting to go out and leave her with the kids instead. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have two young children, which is a lot of work. The wife has a hobby (dancing) and works full-time. She also teaches on Saturdays. The husband gets Fridays off and takes care of the kids that day. On other nights, he's handling the kids alone while she's away for work or personal activities. The husband says he doesn't want to go out and leave her with the kids because he enjoys the family time.\n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibility and mutual understanding. The wife is contributing in her own way, balancing work and her hobby. The husband is taking on a significant portion of childcare duties. However, he's not complaining about the dancing nights but about the other 1-2 nights when she goes out. \n\nNow, is it fair for the husband to feel this way? Well, parenting is a shared responsibility, but it's not always split 50/50. The wife is offering the husband the chance to go out, which he declines. His issue isn't that she's working or dancing but that she's having personal time. He values family time very highly, which is understandable, but he might be expecting the wife to prioritize his needs over hers. \n\nThe wife has her own mental health needs (dancing) and social activities. It's important for both partners to have some personal time. The husband's reluctance to reciprocate by leaving the kids with her might stem from not wanting to be apart, but that doesn't necessarily make him right. The question is whether his expectation that the wife shouldn't have those nights is unreasonable.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband is taking on a lot, but expecting the wife to give up her personal time without compromise could be the issue. The wife's suggestion that he could go out a few nights shows she's trying to balance things, but he's not interested. This could lead to resentment if one partner's needs are always prioritized over the other's. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily a jerk for valuing family time, but he might be in the wrong by not recognizing his wife's need for personal time and not being willing to find a middle ground. The fact that he's taking care of the kids on Fridays and Saturdays already shows his commitment, but expecting the wife to have zero personal time beyond dancing might be unrealistic. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not acknowledging his wife's needs and is unwilling to reciprocate, even though his own needs are valid.\n"
