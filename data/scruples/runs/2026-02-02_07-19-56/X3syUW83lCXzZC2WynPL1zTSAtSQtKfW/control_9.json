Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, the situation: They have two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances 2 nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. On workdays (Tuesday, Wednesday), she leaves after work for dance, so the husband takes care of the kids. On Saturdays, he has the kids all day until 2:30 PM. Additionally, there are 1-2 other nights a week where she's out for work-related events, friends, or a massage, totaling 3-4 nights where he's alone with the kids. He doesn't want to go out because he wants family time, and he's annoyed when she leaves him alone.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in their relationship. The husband is taking on a significant amount of childcare responsibility. The wife's activities are part of her mental well-being, which is important, but the husband feels overwhelmed. \n\nThe wife suggests that he could go out, but he doesn't want to because he values family time. The dilemma is whether his feelings are valid or if he's being selfish.\n\nI need to consider whether his expectations are reasonable. The husband is handling most of the childcare duties on specific nights and weekends. It's a lot of work. If the wife is using those nights for her hobbies and social time, it's a balance. If he's not getting time to himself, that could be a legitimate concern. \n\nHowever, the wife is also contributing by working full-time and taking on her own activities. But the husband's complaint isn't about his own activities but about her leaving him with the kids. The question is whether it's unfair for him to feel this way. \n\nThe husband does want to talk to his wife, which is good. The issue is whether his feelings are justified. In relationships, it's normal for both partners to need personal time. But if the husband is already doing a lot and doesn't want more, that might be okay. The wife might need to find a middle ground, like reducing her activities or the husband being okay with her having them. \n\nThe husband isn't in the wrong if he's not being unreasonable. The problem might be communication. He's not refusing to talk about it. The answer depends on whether his feelings are valid. Since he's taking care of the kids a lot and wants family time, it's reasonable for him to feel some annoyance. So he's not the asshole.\n"
