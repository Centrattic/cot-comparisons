Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's upset that his wife leaves him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. He doesn't want to go out on those nights, even though she suggests he could. They have two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old, so childcare is a big deal. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is working full-time, dancing twice a week, teaching on Saturdays, and has some other engagements. The husband also works full-time but has Fridays off, so he's taking care of the kids then. He's handling most of the childcare duties on those nights and days when the wife is away. \n\nThe husband says he's not opposed to her dancing or her social time; he even appreciates it for her well-being. His issue is that he doesn't want to go out, so when they're all together, he wants to spend that time with the family. The wife suggests he should go out, but he doesn't feel the need to. \n\nThe key points here: Is it fair for the husband to feel this way? Does the wife take on her fair share of responsibilities? The wife is doing dancing and teaching, which might be part of her job or passion, but also adds to her schedule. The husband is left alone with the kids multiple nights, which is a lot. \n\nBut maybe the husband's expectation is that both should have similar free time. However, since they have different schedules and responsibilities, maybe it's not about equality but fairness. The wife is doing her own activities, but the husband is choosing not to go out. Is he responsible for all the childcare because of his schedule? \n\nAnother angle: The husband is okay with her not being there, but he's upset that she's not there and he's left alone. But he's also the one who chooses to stay home with the kids. If he's okay with the kids, why is it a problem? Maybe he's feeling overwhelmed, but he doesn't express that. The wife might be contributing in other ways, like working and doing her dance job. \n\nAlso, considering that they are both working, and the wife has her own time for self-care, which is important. The husband might need to communicate his feelings better, but is he in the wrong for wanting to spend time with the kids when he's home? It might not be wrong, but maybe he's not considering that the wife has her own needs and that both parents shouldn't have to be with the kids every moment. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife is doing her own activities, and he's choosing not to go out. So maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's the only one handling the kids consistently, maybe he should share more responsibilities or consider that the wife is contributing in other ways. But the author doesn't necessarily say he's refusing to help; he's just saying he doesn't want to go out. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on whether the division of responsibilities is fair. If both are working and the wife has her own activities, maybe it's okay for the husband to choose to stay home. But if the husband is shouldering all the childcare when the wife is away, maybe there's an imbalance. However, the author doesn't mention that the wife isn't helping with anything else. The wife is working full-time and doing her dance stuff. \n\nIn some cases, parents take turns having nights off. But the husband is okay with the wife's activities, but just wants to be with the family when they're together. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, the wife might be taking on more than her share, but the husband is choosing to stay. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's expressing his need for family time and is okay with the wife's activities. The wife is also contributing, and it's about mutual respect for each other's needs. The problem might be in communication, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to spend time with the kids when he can.\n"
