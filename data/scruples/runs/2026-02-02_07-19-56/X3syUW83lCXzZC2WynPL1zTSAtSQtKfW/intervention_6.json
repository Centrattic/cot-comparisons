Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances and teaches on certain nights, and there are other nights she's out for work or friends. The husband is taking care of the kids by himself on those nights and on Fridays and Saturdays, but he's not happy about it. He doesn't want to go out because he wants family time when they're all together. The user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has her hobbies (dancing) which are important for her well-being. She's teaching, which is part of her job. The husband is handling the childcare during those times. The question is whether he's wrong to be annoyed. \n\nThe husband isn't saying he can't handle the responsibility, just that he's upset about it. He's not asking for financial support or a babysitter, but he's not going out even though the wife suggests he could. Instead, he wants to spend the time they're all together. \n\nIn many relationships, balancing personal needs and family responsibilities is key. If the wife's activities are necessary for her mental health and they've agreed on this arrangement, maybe the husband should support her. However, if the husband's resentment is affecting the relationship, that's a problem. But the post doesn't mention any major conflicts, just a reality check. \n\nThe husband might be in the right to express his feelings, but if he's not contributing to the solution (like suggesting they hire help or adjust schedules), maybe he's not considering his wife's needs. However, the fact that he plans to talk to her is positive. \n\nThe key points are mutual understanding and compromise. The wife has her commitments, and the husband is handling the kids. The husband's issue is that he doesn't want to go out, but he's okay with her being away. Is it fair for him to expect the same? It's about fairness and communication. If both are working full-time and the wife's activities are part of her job or well-being, the husband might need to accept it. However, he's not wrong to feel overwhelmed. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics. But since the user asks for a yes or no, considering that the husband is expressing his feelings to the wife and not necessarily being unreasonable, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that he's the one always staying home while she goes out might imply some imbalance. But the wife is also handling childcare when they're all together. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn AITA situations, being a \"neutral\" party often looks at whether one party is being unreasonable. If the wife's activities are necessary and she's contributing in other ways, the husband might not be in the wrong for wanting family time. Alternatively, if the arrangement is causing stress without addressing her needs, maybe the husband is being selfish. \n\nSince the husband is handling the kids and not complaining about the actual responsibility but the lack of time with his wife, it's more about wanting to be together. That might not be a typical \"asshole\" move, but it's a personal preference. The wife's needs are also valid. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and it's a matter of perspective.\n"
