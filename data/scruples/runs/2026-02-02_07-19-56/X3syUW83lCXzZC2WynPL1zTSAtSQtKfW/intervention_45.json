Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the wife has been dancing since she was 5, which is a significant part of her life. She dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and there's also 1-2 other nights where she's out for work events, dinners, or with friends. So total around 3-4 nights where the husband is alone with the kids. The husband is handling the kids' care on these nights, including dinners, baths, bedtime, and on weekends. He also has the kids on Fridays when she's not home.\n\nThe husband mentions that the wife suggests he could go out a few nights a week, but he doesn't want to because he values family time. He's feeling overwhelmed and is seeking validation if his feelings are justified.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities: both work full-time, the kids are young (3 and 6 months), so childcare is a big deal. The wife's activities are for her mental well-being, which is important. However, the husband is shouldering most of the childcare duties when the wife is away. The question is whether he's being unreasonable for not wanting to be alone with the kids so often.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about balance. The wife has her own needs and activities, which are valid, but the husband's request for some time off might also be valid. However, he's not asking the wife to stop her activities but rather expressing that he doesn't want to be left alone every week. The key point is whether his expectation is reasonable. If the wife is doing her part (dancing, teaching) and the husband is handling the kids when she's away, maybe there's an imbalance in shared responsibilities. But since the husband is okay with her being away, but just doesn't want to be alone, maybe he should consider going out occasionally to manage his stress, even if it's hard to leave the kids. Alternatively, maybe the wife could adjust her schedule or they could find a solution together, like arranging for help on some nights.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he doesn't want to go out because he values family time, which is understandable. However, he's not asking for anything except that the wife not leave him alone so often. But since she has her own commitments, and he's not willing to take time for himself, maybe the issue is that he's expecting the wife to adjust her schedule to meet his needs, which might not be fair if they haven't communicated this properly. The fact that he's seeking a reality check first shows he's trying to understand, but the core issue is about mutual respect for each other's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's desire to spend time with his family isn't wrong, but expecting the wife to adjust her schedule entirely to meet his needs without compromise might make him in the wrong. However, since the wife is already handling her own activities, and the husband is managing the kids when she's away, perhaps the balance isn't so skewed. If the husband is not asking for anything else but just expressing frustration about being alone, maybe the answer depends on whether there's a fair distribution of responsibilities and mutual support. But given the information, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's not making an unreasonable demand\u2014just expressing a need for more family time, which is valid. So I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
