Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is upset because his wife is leaving him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. They both work full-time, and she has dance classes and other activities. He's handling childcare on those nights and weekends, and he's not interested in going out, so he feels like he's stuck with all the kid duties.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the balance of responsibilities. The wife is doing activities that are important to her mental health, which is valid. She's not avoiding responsibilities but maintaining her well-being. The husband, on the other hand, is handling the kids on those nights and weekends. But he doesn't want to go out, so he's not seeking his own time. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect the wife to stop her activities? The wife's dancing and other nights out are part of her self-care. The husband could be contributing more during the other days or suggesting a shared plan. However, the key point is that he's not in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed, but he might be in the wrong if he's not communicating his needs or contributing equally during other times. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's not interested in going out might mean he's not looking for a balance. If he's not using the time she's out for his own needs, that could be part of the issue. Maybe he should talk about needing more help during the other days or take turns. The wife isn't forcing him to stay; he's choosing to stay. So maybe the problem is that he's not advocating for his needs or sharing the responsibility more evenly. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife's activities are reasonable and within their agreed-upon responsibilities, then the husband's frustration isn't necessarily the wife's fault. However, if he's not taking initiative to balance things out, like contributing more during her time off or suggesting a compromise, then he might be. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but he could be missing opportunities to share the load or communicate better. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he's not going out shows a potential imbalance in how he's handling his own time versus expecting her to stay. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's not seeking solutions but expecting her to change her habits without addressing his own role in the situation.\n"
