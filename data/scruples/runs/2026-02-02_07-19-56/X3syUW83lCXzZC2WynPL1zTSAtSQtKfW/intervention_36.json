Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. He mentions he's going to talk to her but wants a reality check first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has 1-2 other nights out for work or social stuff. The husband feels he's handling most of the childcare, especially since he has Friday off and the kids are home with him. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're together. The wife suggests he should go out, but he's not interested.\n\nSo, the key points here are the division of responsibilities and the husband's feelings about it. The wife has her own hobbies and social needs, which the husband acknowledges and supports. But he's feeling overwhelmed with the childcare duties. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The wife has her own commitments and mental health needs, which are valid. The husband is taking on a significant amount of childcare, which is understandable, but he's not seeking to go out. The problem is whether his desire for more family time and frustration with being alone is unreasonable.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's important that both partners have time for themselves. However, the husband isn't asking for time alone but is okay with staying home. The wife might feel she's contributing by working full-time and handling some childcare, but the husband feels the brunt is on him. It might be a matter of communication and balance. If the husband is okay with the arrangement but feels annoyed, maybe it's not about right or wrong but about adjusting expectations. However, if the workload is unequal, that could be an issue. Since the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nThe husband isn't refusing to take care of the kids, just expressing frustration. The wife's activities are for her well-being. The husband's request isn't about wanting to go out but not wanting to be alone. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's feelings are valid. Since he's not acting in a way that harms others but is expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not contributing in other ways, perhaps. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for his feelings. Since the answer is a simple A or B, I need to decide based on typical perspectives. In many cases, both partners need time for themselves, but the husband's stance is that he's not interested in going out. Unless he's making an unreasonable demand, he might not be in the wrong. So maybe answer B.\n"
