Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's upset that his wife leaves him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife has her own commitments like dancing, work events, and socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband and wife both work full-time. The kids are in daycare during the day, except on Fridays when the husband is off and takes care of them. The wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturdays. Plus, there are 1-2 other nights where she's out for work or social reasons. The husband is handling all the childcare on these nights and days. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time together.\n\nThe husband isn't asking for help; he's just voicing his annoyance. He's considering himself the asshole for being upset about not having help. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is taking on a lot of childcare responsibilities. He's doing all the evening activities and the Saturday morning stuff. It might be tiring, and he might feel like he's not getting his own time. On the other hand, the wife has her own needs and activities, which are important for her well-being. She's offered to take care of the kids when he goes out, but he doesn't want to. \n\nMarriage often requires compromise. The wife is contributing in her own way by maintaining her mental health through dancing and social activities. The husband is handling the childcare when she's away. The key point is whether the husband is unreasonable in his expectations. If he's not interested in going out and wants family time, that's a valid choice. However, he's not asking for help; he's just expressing annoyance. \n\nIs it fair to criticize him for being upset about not having help when he's already taking on the responsibilities? Maybe not. But maybe he should communicate his feelings better and find a solution that works for both. The wife is offering an option (him going out), but he's declining, which is his choice. So, is he in the wrong? It could depend on how they communicate and balance each other's needs. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong because he's not being selfish; he's valuing family time, which is reasonable. However, he might need to express his feelings more clearly and find a middle ground, but the question is whether he's the asshole. Since he's not being unreasonable and both parties have valid needs, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
