Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author mentions that his wife dances and teaches, and they both work. He takes care of the kids on those nights and weekends. He doesn't want to go out, so when she's away, he's alone with them. He's not angry but just wants to see if his perspective is wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the responsibilities each partner has. Both work full-time, so their schedules are packed. The author is handling childcare on specific days, which is a lot, but he's okay with his wife's activities. The key point is that he doesn't want to go out, so when she's away, he's home with the kids. Is that unreasonable?\n\nThe wife's dancing is a hobby she's had since childhood, important for her well-being. The author supports that. But he's feeling overwhelmed with the childcare duties when she's away. However, he's not complaining about her dancing specifically but the fact that she's not there while he's handling the kids. He's not asking for help, just expressing his preference to stay home when they're all together. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect her to stay home so they can all be together when they are home? Or is it reasonable for her to have her own time? The author is not the one attending events; his wife is. He's not objecting to her activities but the situation where he's left alone. But if he doesn't want to go out, maybe it's his choice to stay home. Maybe the issue is more about the logistics of childcare rather than his wife's activities.\n\nAlso, they have a daycare during the day, so he's handling the kids on Fridays instead. On Saturdays, he's there until 2:30. So he's already taking on a significant role in childcare. The problem is the nights when she's out. But he's not saying he can't handle it; he's just annoyed. The question is whether his annoyance is valid.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should have some personal time. The wife has hers, and the author could also seek his own time if he wanted. However, he prefers to stay home with the kids. Maybe the real issue is a lack of shared responsibility. If he's handling the kids so much, maybe they need to discuss how to balance responsibilities. But the author isn't asking for that; he's just not wanting her to leave him alone. \n\nI think the author's main issue is that he wants family time when they are all home, but he's okay with his wife's activities. However, he's not considering that she might need her own time. If he doesn't want to go out, that's his choice, but he should accept that when she's away, he's alone. The problem is that he's annoyed by her leaving, not because of the actual childcare but because he wants her to stay home. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her need for personal time and space. He's focusing on his desire for family time over her needs. Therefore, the answer would be A for yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
