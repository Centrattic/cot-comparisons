Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that the wife has her dance classes and teaching, plus some other activities. The author takes care of the kids on those nights and weekends, but feels it's a lot and doesn't want to go out because they value family time when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is engaging in activities that contribute to her mental well-being, which is important. Both work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day. The author has Fridays off, so the kids are with him then. The wife's dance classes are on Tuesday and Wednesday, and she doesn't come home. The author handles the kids' dinner, baths, bedtime. On Saturdays, he takes care of them until 2:30 PM when the wife returns from teaching. Additionally, there are 1-2 more nights a week where the wife is out for work events or socializing.\n\nThe author isn't against the wife's activities but is feeling overwhelmed by the childcare responsibilities and the lack of family time. He mentions wanting to talk to his wife but seeks validation first.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are balance in responsibilities and mutual understanding. The wife is pursuing her interests and hobbies, which is healthy. The author is handling a significant portion of childcare, especially on specific days. The question is whether it's fair for the author to expect the wife to stay home more often or adjust her schedule. \n\nThe author doesn't want to go out because he values family time. That's understandable, but it's important to consider if the current arrangement is sustainable. However, the wife's activities are also a part of her well-being. The author might be feeling resentful, which can be valid if the workload is imbalanced. But since the wife is doing some activities for her mental health, expecting her to cut those out might not be fair either. \n\nThe author should communicate his feelings to his wife, discussing the balance of responsibilities and perhaps finding a compromise, like splitting childcare duties more evenly or the wife adjusting her schedule where possible. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's expressing a desire for more family time and feels overburdened, it's not necessarily his fault if the workload isn't equally shared. The issue might be more about the balance of responsibilities rather than one person being wrong. \n\nBut is there an expectation that the author should handle more childcare? The wife does mention she suggests he goes out, but he prefers family time. The wife might be assuming that the author is okay with the current arrangement, which might not be the case. The author isn't against her being out per se, but the accumulation of nights alone with the kids is causing stress. \n\nIn conclusion, since both partners have valid needs (wife's mental health and author's desire for family time), it's more about finding a middle ground. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, especially if the current arrangement isn't balanced. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
