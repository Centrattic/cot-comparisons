Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they should feel guilty for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The wife has been dancing since she was 5, which is a hobby important for her mental health. She dances two nights and teaches on Saturdays. The author has a full-time job and takes care of the kids on Fridays when they're home from daycare. On top of that, she has other nights out for work meetings, dinners, etc., adding up to 3-4 nights. The author says they both work full-time, so maybe they have a shared responsibility, but the author is handling most of the childcare when the wife is away.\n\nThe author mentions they don't want to go out, preferring family time. The wife suggests the author should go out, but the author isn't interested in that. The key point is whether the author is being selfish by not wanting the wife to leave them alone so often.\n\nNow, considering fairness in responsibilities. Both parents have full-time jobs, so it's expected they split childcare duties. The wife is contributing by dancing and teaching, which she has done for years, and the author is handling the kids when she's away. Maybe the author should also take some nights for themselves, but they don't want to. The author isn't complaining about the dancing itself but the frequency. The question is if it's reasonable to expect the wife to reduce her nights out.\n\nAnother angle: The wife's activities are part of her well-being, and the author's being the primary caregiver when she's away. But if the author is okay with it, maybe there's no issue. However, the author is now expressing annoyance, which might indicate an imbalance. But the author also says they understand and appreciate her need to dance. \n\nSo, the author might feel overwhelmed, but they haven't mentioned any specific negative impact on the kids or their own well-being. The problem is more about wanting companionship time rather than the childcare itself. If the author is handling the kids without resentment and just wants more family time, maybe it's not their fault. However, expecting the wife to give up her hobbies solely for the author's desire for company might be unfair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both should have some time for themselves. The author could benefit from having some nights out, but they choose not to. The wife isn't forcing the author to take care of the kids; maybe the author is the one who agreed to it. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're handling the responsibility and the wife is maintaining her mental health through her activities. However, the author's annoyance might stem from unmet needs for family time, which is valid, but the wife isn't obligated to adjust her schedule unless it's causing harm. \n\nAlternatively, if the author feels they're doing the lion's share and want the wife to reduce her time away, that could be a point of contention. But since the author isn't asking for that, just expressing annoyance, maybe it's not the author's fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is managing the responsibilities and acknowledging the wife's needs, even if they feel some annoyance. They are not forcing their wife to stop her activities, just expressing their feelings.\n"
