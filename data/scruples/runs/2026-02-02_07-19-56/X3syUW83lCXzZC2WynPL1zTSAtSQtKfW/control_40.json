Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is at fault for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, the wife has been dancing since she was five, so it's a long-standing hobby. She dances twice a week after work and teaches on Saturdays. The husband takes care of the kids on those nights and all day on Fridays and Saturdays when she's away. \n\nHe mentions that she also has other nights out for work-related events or social activities, adding up to 3-4 nights. The wife suggests he could go out sometimes, but he prefers to stay with the family.\n\nI need to consider if his feelings are valid. He's taking on a lot of childcare responsibility, which can be exhausting. It's important for both partners to have personal time and hobbies. The wife's activities are for her mental health, which is crucial. However, the husband feeling overwhelmed or wanting more family time isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe key points: Both are working full-time, the husband is handling the kids alone multiple nights, and he's not seeking to go out but just wants the family time they have together. The wife might need to acknowledge his workload and perhaps adjust her schedule or share more responsibilities. \n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for feeling this way. Since he's expressing a desire for more family time rather than being selfish, it's a valid concern. The answer likely isn't A (he's the asshole) because he's not unreasonable. However, both need to communicate and find a balance. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
