Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturday, and sometimes has other activities. The husband does all the childcare during those nights and weekends. He doesn't want to go out because he enjoys family time, and he's annoyed when she goes out. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the balance in the relationship. Both partners work full-time, so they're both busy. The wife has her dance hobby, which is important for her well-being. The husband is taking on the childcare responsibilities during her absence. He's not opposed to her going out per se but is annoyed because he's left alone with the kids. He doesn't want to go out, preferring family time. \n\nThe key points here: Is it fair for the husband to expect his wife to stay home those nights? The wife is contributing in her own way, but the husband is taking on more childcare. However, the husband isn't complaining about the work they both do during the day. The issue is his annoyance when she's away and the suggestion that he could go out instead. \n\nThe husband mentions he's not against her dancing and appreciates her need for it. So he's not upset about her activities but the fact that he's left alone. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. He values family time, which is understandable. But in a relationship, both partners should have some personal time. \n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? If the wife is meeting her own needs (dance, socializing), the husband might need to find a way to get his needs met as well. If he's not going out because he wants family time, maybe he's not considering that his wife's time away is part of her self-care, which is important. However, the husband is taking on a lot of childcare, which is valid. \n\nThe question is whether it's fair to resent her going out when he's okay with the arrangement otherwise. The husband isn't asking for childcare help during those times; he's handling it. The problem is his annoyance that she's not there. If he's content with the family time when they are together, maybe his issue is not with the childcare but with the frequency. But maybe he's expecting the wife to sacrifice her time more than is reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have personal time. The wife is doing activities that are important to her. The husband might need to find his own way to have personal time without expecting the wife to stay home. Since he doesn't want to go out, maybe he's not taking initiative to get his needs met, which could be where the problem lies. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's okay with the childcare responsibilities but annoyed that his wife isn't home, maybe he's being a bit selfish in his expectations. The wife is maintaining her hobbies and mental health, which is crucial. The husband's solution is to have the wife stay home, but that's not fair to her. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's needs and is not seeking alternative ways to satisfy his desire for family time without expecting her to sacrifice hers.\n"
