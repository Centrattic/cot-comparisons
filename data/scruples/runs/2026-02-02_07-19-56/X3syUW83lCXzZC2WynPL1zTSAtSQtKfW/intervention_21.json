Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has other commitments like work dinners or social events. The husband gets Fridays off and takes care of the kids during the day. The key point is that the husband is taking care of the kids on these nights and days, but he's upset that his wife isn't there.\n\nThe husband mentions he doesn't want to go out and leave her alone with the kids because he values family time. The wife, on the other hand, has her own activities. The husband is frustrated but acknowledges her need for dance as part of her mental health. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, both partners have their own needs. The wife is contributing by being away for work-related and personal activities, which are important for her well-being. The husband is taking on a significant share of childcare responsibilities. However, the husband's main issue isn't the childcare itself but that he doesn't want to leave the kids with his wife to have time for himself. \n\nThe problem might be communication. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. If he's not interested in going out, then his frustration is about the lack of shared family time, not necessarily the childcare burden. The fact that he's taking care of the kids doesn't automatically mean he's wrong to want more time together. However, the wife also has her own needs and commitments. \n\nIn terms of balance, it's possible that the husband's expectations are reasonable, but the way he's framing it might be seen as expecting his wife to adjust her schedule to accommodate his desire for family time. Since he's the one who's taking care of the kids, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the wife is fulfilling her part by having her own activities and he's not willing to reciprocate by going out, that could be an issue. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and understanding. The husband's frustration is valid, but he might need to communicate his needs better and find a compromise. However, since he's not forcing his wife to change her activities and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife's activities are affecting the family dynamics significantly, there might be a need for adjustments. \n\nOverall, the situation seems to require more negotiation rather than declaring someone wrong. The husband's perspective is understandable, especially with two young children. The wife's activities are also valid for her mental health. The answer might hinge on whether the husband is being selfish in expecting his wife to adjust or if his needs are equally valid.\n"
