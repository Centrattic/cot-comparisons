Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The husband is taking care of the kids multiple nights a week, including after daycare and on weekends. He mentions that he's appreciative of his wife's need to dance for her mental health but feels overwhelmed when she also leaves for other reasons like work events or socializing. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nThe wife dances two nights a week and teaches on Saturday. She's also taking 1-2 extra nights for other activities. So together, that's 3-4 nights where he's alone with the kids. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to stay home and spend time with the family when they're together.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not refusing to help his wife; he's actually doing the childcare himself. His issue is that he's tired of being alone with the kids so much and doesn't want to go out. It seems like he's not being unreasonable here. He's expressing his need for family time and possibly feeling overburdened with childcare responsibilities. The wife's activities are for her well-being, but balancing both partners' needs is key in a relationship. \n\nHe's not blaming her for wanting to have her own time, but he's also voicing his own needs. It's about finding a middle ground, not about being an asshole. So the answer is probably B (he's not in the wrong). He's just asking for support and understanding, which is valid.\n"
