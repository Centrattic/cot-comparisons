Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is a husband who's taking care of the kids multiple nights a week while his wife is out dancing, attending work events, or hanging out with friends. He's asking if it's his fault for being annoyed that she leaves him alone so often.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The wife has been dancing since she was 5, so it's a long-standing hobby. She dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays. Plus, there are 1-2 other nights when she's out for work or social stuff. That totals 3-4 nights a week where the husband is alone with the kids. The husband mentions he gets Fridays off and takes care of the kids that day. On Saturdays, he's with them until 2:30 when the wife comes back. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together.\n\nNow, the key points here are the balance of responsibilities and mutual needs. The wife is prioritizing her mental health through dancing, which is important. The husband is handling a lot of childcare duties by himself, which might be overwhelming. The question is whether his feelings of annoyance make him the asshole.\n\nThe author isn't saying he doesn't support her dancing, but he's expressing that he's tired of being the sole caregiver those nights. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. That might indicate that there's a lack of understanding from her side about his feelings. However, he's willing to talk about it, which is a positive step.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have their own needs. The wife needs time for herself and her hobbies, which is valid. The husband needs support in parenting and some personal time. It's possible that the current arrangement isn't balanced. The fact that he's handling most of the childcare alone might be contributing to his stress. It's not necessarily his fault for feeling this way; it's more about communication and finding a compromise.\n\nThe wife might not be aware of the extent of his workload. Maybe they need to redistribute responsibilities or find alternatives like hiring help or getting family support. The author's request is reasonable\u2014he wants some balance and support, not to take on all the childcare by himself. So, he's not in the wrong for feeling this way. The issue is more about negotiation and mutual adjustment rather than one person being the asshole.\n"
