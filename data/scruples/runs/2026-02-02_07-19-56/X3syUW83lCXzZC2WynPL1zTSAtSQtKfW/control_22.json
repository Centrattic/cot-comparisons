Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that his wife has dance classes and teaches on Saturdays. He's handling the kids on those nights and weekends, and he's not interested in going out to have time with the family when they're all home. The wife suggests he could go out a few nights, but he doesn't want to. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both work full-time, the kids are in daycare during the week except on Fridays when the author stays home. The wife's activities are after work, which she's done since childhood, important for her well-being. The author is taking care of the kids every time she's away, which he acknowledges isn't a problem. However, he's feeling overwhelmed or just wants more family time. The key here is whether his expectations are reasonable.\n\nThe wife is contributing by taking care of her mental health through dancing, which is valid. The author's issue isn't with the activities themselves but with the frequency and the fact that he's handling the kids alone. He doesn't want to go out, which is his choice, but his wife suggests he could. The problem arises if the author is expecting the wife to stop her activities without considering her needs. However, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting some family time, especially since they are not in an abusive or unequal situation. The balance here is about mutual respect for each other's needs. The author isn't refusing to share responsibilities but is expressing a need for more family time. The wife's suggestion that he should go out might not align with his preferences. Since the author isn't asking her to stop dancing but is expressing his feelings, it's more about communication and finding a middle ground rather than one being wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
