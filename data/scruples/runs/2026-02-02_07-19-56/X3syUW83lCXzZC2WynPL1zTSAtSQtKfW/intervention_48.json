Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides of the situation. The husband is frustrated because his wife is away several nights a week for dancing, work events, and friends. He's taking care of the kids alone each time, and he's not interested in going out when she's home. He acknowledges her reasons for dancing for her well-being but feels overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a long-standing hobby (dancing since age 5) and a job. They both work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day. He gets Fridays off, so he's with the kids then. She's also teaching on Saturdays. The husband is handling the kids alone on those nights and days. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for being annoyed. The user thinks he is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to assess.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Husband's Perspective**: He's managing childcare alone multiple times a week, which is a significant responsibility. He values family time when everyone is together, which is valid. He doesn't want to go out, which is his choice, but that might contribute to his frustration.\n\n2. **Wife's Perspective**: She has a hobby that's important for her mental health. She's working full-time and teaching. She suggests he could go out, implying she's willing if he does. But he doesn't want to.\n\n3. **Balance of Responsibilities**: Both have responsibilities. The husband is handling childcare when she's away. Is it fair for her to be away that often? Or is it reasonable for him to expect more shared time?\n\n4. **Communication**: The husband is planning to talk to his wife, which is good. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nPossible angles: \n\n- The husband might not be wrong if the workload is too much for him. However, he hasn't mentioned discussing the arrangement to split responsibilities differently. Maybe he could ask for more help or adjust schedules.\n\n- The wife's activities are important for her well-being, but they do place a burden on him. If he's handling all the childcare, perhaps she should consider balancing her time more to support him.\n\n- The husband's desire for family time is valid, but he's not going out when she's home, so maybe he's not contributing to his own downtime. However, his preference for family time doesn't make him wrong if he's not imposing it on her.\n\nAnother angle: The husband's frustration is about being alone with the kids multiple times a week. If the wife is doing this for her own needs, is it fair to expect him to handle it without resentment? Or is it part of a shared parenting responsibility?\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both are working full-time and have their own schedules, they might need to find a middle ground. The husband's annoyance might not make him the \"asshole\" if he's expressing a legitimate need without being unreasonable. But if he's not contributing to the solution or is being passive-aggressive, that could be an issue.\n\nHowever, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, possibly because the wife's activities are for her well-being, and the husband should share the load. But the husband doesn't want to go out, so he's not adding his own time away. Maybe the husband is not wrong in wanting to spend time with the family when they're together.\n\nI think the key here is whether the husband's frustration is justified. Since both have their own needs, and the wife's dancing is a long-standing hobby, the husband's frustration might be valid. However, he needs to communicate his needs and perhaps find a compromise, like adjusting schedules or getting help with childcare. But is he in the wrong? If he's expressing his feelings without blaming, maybe not. But if he's expecting her to stop dancing entirely without discussion, that could be problematic. Since he hasn't done that yet, he's planning to talk. \n\nIn the context of Reddit's AITA format, people often find the person in the wrong when they're not considering the other person's needs. Here, the husband's needs are about wanting family time, which is reasonable. The wife's needs are about her personal well-being through dancing. The balance here is important. Since he's not forcing her to stop and is planning to talk, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the workload is excessive, maybe he is expecting her to adjust without considering her side. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed. Being annoyed is a natural reaction. The issue would be if he's being unreasonable in his expectations. Since he's not going out, and he's handling the kids alone, his annoyance is valid. So maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he hasn't communicated his needs effectively or is not contributing to solutions, that could be a problem. But from his post, he's planning to talk, so he's trying to address it.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing a valid concern about the balance of responsibilities and family time, and he's taking steps to communicate. The wife's activities are also valid, but the husband's needs should be considered as well. The key is mutual understanding and compromise, which he's attempting to pursue.\n"
