Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset that his wife is away 2-4 nights a week for dancing and other activities, leaving him to take care of the kids. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is handling most of the childcare when his wife is away, which is a lot of work. He's taking care of the kids' meals, baths, putting them to bed, and even managing them all day on Fridays and Saturdays. That's a significant responsibility. He does mention that he understands his wife's need for dancing for her mental health, which is a positive point.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has been dancing since she was a child, so it's a long-standing hobby. She's teaching as well, which might be more time-consuming. She offers that the husband could go out, but he doesn't want to because he wants family time. The key issue here is the balance between personal time and family responsibilities. \n\nThe husband is frustrated because he's left alone with the kids, but he's not asking for help from his wife when she's away. The wife is contributing in her own way by managing the kids on other days, especially since both work full-time. The husband's request isn't that he wants her to stop dancing but that he wants her to be there more often. However, he's not suggesting any compromise, like taking turns or sharing responsibilities differently.\n\nI think the husband is in the right because he's expressing a need for family time, which is valid. But he's not wrong because he's not making an unreasonable demand. The wife, on the other hand, is maintaining her mental health through dancing, which is also important. The problem might be communication or a lack of compromise. However, since the husband is willing to talk to his wife and get a reality check, he's taking a responsible step. So, he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
