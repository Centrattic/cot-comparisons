Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author's main issue is that his wife is away 2-4 nights a week, leaving him to handle the kids alone. He doesn't want to go out and prefers to spend time with the family when they're all together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has her own commitments\u2014dancing twice a week, teaching on Saturdays, plus some work events and social time. These activities contribute to her mental and emotional well-being, which is important. The author does acknowledge that he understands her need for these activities. However, he feels overwhelmed by the childcare responsibilities and is frustrated because he doesn't want to go out, so he's left with the kids every time she's away.\n\nThe key points here are balance and communication. The wife is contributing to the family by working full-time and managing her own well-being through dancing. The author is also working full-time, handling daycare pickups, and taking care of the kids on Fridays and part of Saturdays. The problem arises when the author feels that the frequency of his wife's absence is causing him stress, but he's not seeking to go out, which might be a way others might handle it.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, wanting time with the family isn't unreasonable. However, the wife's activities are part of her self-care, which is valid. The author hasn't mentioned discussing his needs directly with his wife beyond the initial conversation where she suggested he could go out. If they're not communicating effectively, that's part of the problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners have responsibilities and need time for themselves. The author is managing a lot, but he's not necessarily wrong for feeling overwhelmed. The fact that he's considering talking to his wife shows he's trying to address it. However, the wife's activities are not excessive in the traditional sense; they include work-related events and personal hobbies. The author's issue is more about the distribution of childcare responsibilities and his desire for family time. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the arrangement is equitable. If the wife is taking more nights than him, but he's not reciprocating by taking on more when he's available, maybe there's an imbalance. However, since he's not interested in going out, it's not about him not taking opportunities. It's more about the existing schedule. \n\nIn many relationships, partners balance each other's needs. If the wife's activities are necessary for her well-being, and the author is capable of handling the kids, but is feeling resentful, perhaps the issue is more about communication and finding a middle ground rather than one person being wrong. The author isn't being selfish, but he's not entirely right either if he's not considering the wife's needs. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the wife's activities are justified as part of her self-care, the author's frustration is valid. However, he might need to adjust his expectations or find ways to share responsibilities better. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his feelings are understandable, and he's trying to communicate. But I need to check if there's a red flag. The wife leaving him 3-4 nights a week could be a problem if it's leading to burnout, but the author hasn't mentioned that. He just expresses annoyance. Since he's willing to talk, maybe it's not a clear wrong. So B.\n"
