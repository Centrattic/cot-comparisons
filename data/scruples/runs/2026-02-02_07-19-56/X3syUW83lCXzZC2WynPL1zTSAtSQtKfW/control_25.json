Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. The author works full-time, his wife too. They have two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturday, and has 1-2 other nights out for various reasons. The author handles all the childcare on those nights and also on Fridays when the kids don't go to daycare. He doesn't want to leave the kids with the wife alone on those nights because he wants to spend time with the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the division of responsibilities. The author is taking care of the kids alone multiple nights a week. That's a significant amount of work, especially with a baby and a toddler. The wife is also working full-time, but she's going out for her hobbies and social activities. The author mentions that he doesn't want to go out because he wants to spend time with the family when they're together. But that seems to be a valid point\u2014family time is important.\n\nHowever, the wife is contributing by working and having her own activities for her well-being. The author is not opposing her dancing or other activities, just the frequency. The key issue here is the balance of responsibilities and personal time. The author is handling the kids alone multiple nights, which might be leading to burnout. On the other hand, the wife is also working and has her own needs.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The wife suggests that the author could leave the kids with her more, but he doesn't want to. Maybe there's a miscommunication or differing priorities. The author is not in the wrong if he's willing to talk about it and find a solution. But he's also not considering that the wife might need her time as well. It's a mutual responsibility situation.\n\nBut the author is expressing annoyance, which is normal, but is it justified? He's handling a lot, but he's not refusing to help; he's just not wanting to give up his family time. The problem might be that the current arrangement isn't sustainable for the author. He might need to negotiate with his wife to find a middle ground, maybe reducing the number of nights or sharing responsibilities differently.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't being malicious. He's voicing his feelings, which is healthy. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should be more flexible. However, given the context, his feelings are valid, and he's looking for a reality check, which is a reasonable approach.\n"
