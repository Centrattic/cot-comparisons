Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has two young children, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays, which she's done since childhood. She also has other nights out for work events or friends. The husband is handling the kids on those nights and days when she's away. He's not against her dancing but is annoyed about being left alone so often. He doesn't want to go out on the rare nights they're all together.\n\nThe key points here are: both work full-time, the kids are in daycare during the day except Fridays when the husband stays with them. The wife's activities are 2 nights (Tues, Wed) and sometimes 1-2 more, totaling 3-4 nights. The husband feels overwhelmed, but he doesn't want to leave the family time to go out.\n\nI need to consider if the husband is in the wrong. The question is about his annoyance and not wanting to be left alone. Is it unreasonable? Well, parenting is a shared responsibility, but the wife is working full-time too. The husband is taking on a significant portion of the childcare when she's away. However, the wife's activities also contribute to her well-being, which is important. \n\nBut the husband's main issue isn't that she's working or dancing; it's that he's handling the kids alone multiple nights and he doesn't want to go out. He mentions he wants family time when they're together. That's valid. However, expecting the wife to stay home more when she's already working and has her own hobbies might be the issue. \n\nThe wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. It's a matter of differing needs. The husband might be feeling overburdened, but is it fair to expect the wife to adjust her schedule significantly? He hasn't mentioned discussing his workload or needing help. Maybe he should take on some of the childcare when she's away, but he's doing it already. \n\nIs it the husband's fault for not wanting to go out? Or is the wife's schedule the problem? The AITA posts often hinge on whether the person's expectations are unreasonable. The husband's request is that the wife not leave him alone so often. But since the wife has her own reasons for her schedule, and the husband is managing it, maybe the issue is that he's not addressing his own needs or contributing more to lighten the load. \n\nAlternatively, he's not wrong to want more family time. However, he might be in the wrong if he's expecting the wife to give up her activities without compromise. The answer might depend on whether the husband is communicating his needs effectively and if both are sharing the load fairly. Since he's handling the kids on those nights, maybe he's not wrong, but he should communicate better. However, if he's not offering to share the responsibility more during other times, that could be a problem. \n\nIn some cases, it's about balance. The wife has her hobbies, and the husband has his family time. It's possible neither is entirely wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband's annoyance is due to feeling overwhelmed and not having alone time, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's not contributing to the household when he's home or not helping with the kids during the days, that could be an issue. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his needs and it's a valid concern about the workload, but he should communicate better. However, some might argue he's in the wrong for not accepting his wife's activities. \n\nI think the answer is B because the husband's feelings are valid, and he's not wrong to feel overwhelmed. The problem is more about communication and finding a balance, not necessarily that he's at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
