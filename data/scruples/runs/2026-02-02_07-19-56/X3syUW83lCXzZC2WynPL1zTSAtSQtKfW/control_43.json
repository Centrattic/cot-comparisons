Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturday, and has other events. The husband is taking care of the kids by himself on those nights and days. He feels annoyed but doesn't want to go out because he wants family time. The wife suggests he could go out, but he prefers to stay with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both work full-time, the kids are in daycare during the day except Fridays. The husband has Fridays off and the kids are with him. The wife's activities are after work, so she's not home. The husband is handling all the childcare alone on those nights and days. He's not asking for the wife to stop dancing, just that he's not comfortable being left alone with the kids 3-4 nights a week.\n\nIs the husband wrong for feeling this way? Well, it's reasonable for someone to feel overwhelmed with the responsibility. The wife's activities are important to her mental health, which is valid. But the husband's feelings about missing family time and not wanting to go out are also valid. He's not rejecting her activities but is expressing his need for support and shared responsibility.\n\nThe wife's suggestion that he could go out is a possible solution, but he doesn't want to because he values family time. That's a personal choice. The key point is communication. Both parties have their needs. The husband isn't being an asshole for wanting help or for preferring to spend time with the kids when he can. It's a matter of balancing both their needs. Since he's planning to talk to her, it's a step toward resolving the issue. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
