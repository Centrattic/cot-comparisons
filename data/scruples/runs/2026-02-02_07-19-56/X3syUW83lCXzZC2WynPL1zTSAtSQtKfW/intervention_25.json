Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. They have two kids, and the wife has dance classes and teaching, plus other nights out. The husband takes care of the kids all by himself on those nights and also on Fridays and Saturdays when the kids are with him. He doesn't want to go out because he likes family time, and he's feeling burdened.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which are important for her well-being. They both work full-time, and the husband has a day off on Fridays. It seems like they have a shared responsibility during the day when the kids are in daycare, but nights are when the wife is away. The husband is handling the kids alone on those nights, which can be tiring, especially with a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. \n\nThe key points here are balance and communication. The wife is contributing in her own way, but maybe the husband feels it's not enough. However, the husband is also taking on the majority of the childcare during the nights. The wife is suggesting he should go out, but he doesn't want to. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for not wanting to go out? He's not obligated to, but maybe he could find a middle ground, like taking time for himself in other ways. But he's already doing the childcare, so maybe it's reasonable to expect some support from the wife. However, the wife has her own reasons for staying out, like mental health and hobbies. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. They need to talk about their expectations and find a balance that works for both. The husband shouldn't be the sole caregiver all those nights. The wife might need to adjust her schedule or offer more help when she's home. But the husband is also not wrong for feeling overwhelmed. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but they need to work it out together. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not being unreasonable and the wife's activities are important, but the husband's needs are valid too, maybe B is correct.\n"
