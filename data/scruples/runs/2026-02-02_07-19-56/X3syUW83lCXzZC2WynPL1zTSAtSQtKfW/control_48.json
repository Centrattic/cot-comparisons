Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband is taking care of the kids 2-4 nights a week while the wife is out dancing, teaching, or attending events. He's not annoyed about her activities per se, but he's frustrated because he doesn't want to leave the kids to go out, and he's feeling like he's shouldering the responsibility alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The wife has her own activities for mental health and well-being. She's dancing twice a week and teaching on Saturdays. The husband is handling the kids during those nights and on Fridays when they stay home. He's not opposed to her going out, but he doesn't want to go out himself, so when she's out, he's left alone with the kids. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is contributing to her mental health, which is important. Both parents work full-time, so balancing work and family is a challenge. The husband is taking on a significant share of childcare. However, the wife is suggesting that he could go out some nights, but he prefers to stay home. The issue is that he's not wanting to go out, leading to him being alone with the kids multiple nights a week. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect the wife to not leave him alone so much? He's not asking her to stop her activities entirely, but he's expressing frustration. The problem might be about the division of childcare responsibilities. If he's handling the kids 3-4 nights a week, maybe there's a need for more shared responsibility or support. However, the wife is already doing her own activities, and he's not interested in going out. \n\nThe key points are mutual understanding and fairness. If he doesn't want to go out, maybe the issue is that the wife isn't recognizing his need for alone time or support. Alternatively, if the wife is already contributing in her own way (dancing for mental health), maybe the husband's request is reasonable. But he's not asking her to stop her activities; he's just not wanting to be alone with the kids. \n\nAnother angle: The husband is taking care of the kids on those nights, but maybe the wife is also taking care of them during the day when he's working. It's possible that the balance is fair, but the husband feels overburdened. Or perhaps there's a lack of communication about expectations. The husband mentions he plans to talk to his wife, which is good, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for parents to split childcare duties, but there's no one-size-fits-all. If the wife is doing her own activities and the husband is handling the nights, maybe it's his choice to stay with the kids. However, if he's feeling overwhelmed, that's a valid concern. But the problem is that he's not willing to go out, so he's left with the kids. The wife is suggesting he could leave, but he doesn't want to. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not asking her to stop her activities and is content with the arrangement, then maybe not. But he's annoyed because he's alone with the kids. The problem might lie in the balance of responsibilities or lack of shared time. However, the author isn't asking her to change her habits, just expressing annoyance about being alone. \n\nBut maybe he should consider that the wife also needs her time, and he's choosing to stay with the kids. If he's okay with the kids, then maybe his frustration is about wanting more time out, which he's not taking. The wife is giving him the chance to go out, but he's not using it. So perhaps the issue is his own choice to not go out, leading to his annoyance. In that case, maybe he's not in the wrong for being annoyed, but maybe he's not handling it well. \n\nAlternatively, if the balance is unfair, the answer could be different. But based on the information given, the husband is handling the kids on those nights, and the wife is contributing in other ways. The husband's annoyance might be valid if he feels he's overburdened, but he's not in the wrong for not wanting to leave the kids. It's a matter of personal preference. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). He's expressing his feelings without blaming the wife's activities, which are important for her well-being. His issue is with being alone, which is a personal choice he makes by not going out. The wife is offering an option, but he's not taking it because he prefers family time. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for his feelings, but maybe the situation needs better communication or balance.\n"
