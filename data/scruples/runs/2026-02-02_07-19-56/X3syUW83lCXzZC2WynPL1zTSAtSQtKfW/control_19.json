Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. The scenario involves a working couple with two young children, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances and teaches dance lessons, and she also has work-related events and social plans. The husband is handling childcare on those nights and weekends, which he's okay with except he's feeling overwhelmed and doesn't want to go out when his wife does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which are important for her mental health. The husband is managing childcare duties on multiple nights and weekends, which is a significant commitment. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time when they're all together. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The husband says he appreciates her need for dancing but feels stretched thin. The wife's suggestion that he could go out doesn't align with his desire for family time. It's possible that both are trying to maintain their individual needs while managing family life.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for being annoyed? Well, it's reasonable for him to feel that he's shouldering more childcare responsibility, especially since he's not seeking social time and is instead focusing on family. However, the wife also has valid needs for her own activities. The problem might not be who's right, but rather a lack of balance and communication. Since they are both working and managing childcare, it's important that they discuss how to share responsibilities equitably. \n\nThe husband isn't wrong for expressing his feelings, but maybe the focus should be on finding a solution together rather than assigning blame. The answer would depend on whether the husband's expectations are unrealistic. Since he's not wanting to go out but is handling the kids, it's more about needing the wife to recognize his workload and perhaps adjust her schedule or find alternative arrangements, rather than him being the asshole for not wanting to go out. So, the answer is probably B (he's not in the wrong), but there's a need for better communication and shared responsibility.\n"
