Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays. She also has other commitments like work dinners or social events 1-2 nights a week. The husband is taking care of the kids on these nights and also on Fridays (his day off) and part of Saturdays. He's not against his wife having these activities, but he's feeling overwhelmed and doesn't want to go out himself, preferring family time. The wife suggests he should go out, but he doesn't want to. He's asking if he's the asshole for being annoyed about this.\n\nSo, the key points are: The husband is handling a lot of childcare alone multiple nights a week and on days when he's already off work. He's not opposed to his wife's activities but is feeling the strain. The wife thinks he should go out, but he prefers family time. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, it's common for one partner to take on more responsibilities at times, but balance is usually important. The husband is clearly contributing by taking care of the kids during the week, which is a lot, especially with a 6-month-old. However, the wife also has her own needs and activities. The husband's main issue is not that his wife is doing these things but that he's handling the childcare alone, and he's not interested in going out, which might leave him feeling resentful.\n\nThe wife's suggestion that he should go out might be coming from a place of trying to share responsibilities or give him some personal time. However, the husband's preference for family time is also valid. The problem here seems to be a lack of mutual understanding or compromise. If the husband is feeling overwhelmed, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, the wife also has her own needs and activities, so there might be an expectation of shared responsibility or compromise in their roles.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, it's not necessarily about being right or wrong, but about communication and balancing needs. The husband is justified in feeling that he's shouldering a lot and not wanting to go out. The wife might need to adjust her schedule or find ways to support him more. Alternatively, maybe they need to find a middle ground where both can have some time for themselves and the kids. The husband isn't wrong for feeling this way, but the situation might require better communication and negotiation between them rather than a simple right or wrong judgment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his feelings and needs, which is a valid part of a relationship. The situation likely needs more dialogue and compromise rather than blaming one party.\n"
