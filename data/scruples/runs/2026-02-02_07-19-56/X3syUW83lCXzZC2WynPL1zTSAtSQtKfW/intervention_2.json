Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two young kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has 1-2 other nights where she's out for work or social events. The husband gets Fridays off, so he's with the kids on that day. On Saturdays, he's with them until 2:30 PM. The wife suggests he could go out some nights, but he prefers to stay home and be with the kids when they're together.\n\nThe husband states he's not against his wife's activities and appreciates her need for them. His issue is that he's left alone with the kids more often than he wants. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Both work full-time, and the wife has her own commitments. The husband is handling significant childcare duties multiple nights and a full day. He's not asking for more help, but he's uncomfortable with the current arrangement. The wife is willing to let him go out, but he chooses not to. \n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to expect the wife to adjust her schedule for his comfort? Or is it reasonable for him to want quality family time? The wife's activities are important for her well-being. The husband's preference isn't about resentment over childcare but about valuing family time. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise. The wife is contributing by taking on her own time for activities that matter to her. The husband's choice to stay home instead of going out isn't a demand for more help but a personal preference. Since he's not asking her to change anything and is willing to discuss, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the original question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting her to leave him alone. If the wife is already doing her part and he's not expressing a need for more help, just a preference for family time, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, maybe he's being selfish by not taking the opportunity to have his own time, leaving the wife to have hers. \n\nBut the wife is the one who suggested he could go out. He's declining, which is his choice. The problem is that he's annoyed that she's leaving him alone. But since he's not asking for help and is okay with the childcare, maybe his annoyance is about wanting more family time, not about the childcare tasks. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to have mutual understanding. If both are fulfilling their needs (wife's need for personal time, husband's need for family time), then it's a balance. The husband isn't in the wrong if he's content with the arrangement except for the frequency. However, if the wife feels her needs are met and he's just being inconvenient, that's another angle. \n\nBut the husband is proactive in wanting to talk to her. It's possible that he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not refusing to help or being resentful, just expressing a desire for more family time, which is valid.\n"
