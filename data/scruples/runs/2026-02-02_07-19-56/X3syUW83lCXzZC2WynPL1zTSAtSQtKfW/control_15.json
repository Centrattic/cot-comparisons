Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author's wife dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays. They both work full-time, and daycare is used during the day. On Fridays, the author is home with the kids. The wife is out on Tues and Wed nights, and on Saturdays from morning until 2:30 PM, the author takes care of everything. Additionally, there are 1-2 more nights for her work events or friends. So that's 3-4 nights where the author is alone with the kids. The author feels annoyed but wants to spend time with the family when they're together. The wife suggests he could go out a few nights, but he doesn't want to.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared responsibilities and expectations. The wife has her hobbies and personal time, which is important for her well-being. The author is taking on a significant childcare role on multiple nights and weekends but feels that when they are together, he wants to spend time as a family. The wife's perspective is that the author could also take some nights for himself, implying a balance. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to go out? Well, the author is already handling a lot. He might feel that his personal time is limited, and when they are all together, he wants to maximize family time. On the other hand, the wife's activities are also part of her mental health and balance. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable in not wanting to leave the kids with her occasionally. \n\nBut wait, the wife is suggesting that the author could go out, but he doesn't want to. So, it's a matter of mutual expectations. The author is not objecting to her going out; he's just not interested in going out. The problem is that he's taking on all the childcare without feeling that he gets sufficient family time. \n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe they need to adjust schedules to allow the author to have some nights off. The wife is already doing a lot with her dance and teaching, but the author's contribution is significant too. However, the author isn't complaining about the wife's activities per se, but about the fact that he's handling the kids alone multiple times a week and not getting the chance to have personal time. \n\nThe wife's suggestion that he could go out might not consider the author's preference to be with the family. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. The author's feelings are valid if he's feeling overwhelmed. But since the author is open to talking about it, the answer might be that he's not the asshole. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
