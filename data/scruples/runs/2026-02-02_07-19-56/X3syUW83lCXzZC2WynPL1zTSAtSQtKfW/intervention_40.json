Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that his wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other events. He's handling the kids on those nights and weekends. He's not against her activities but is frustrated that he's left alone so much. The question is if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both work full-time, and the kids are in daycare during the day. The wife's dance and teaching are important for her mental health. She also has other obligations like work meetings. The husband is taking care of the kids on these nights and weekends. He doesn't want to go out, so he's left alone with the kids.\n\nThe author argues that he's not the asshole because he's doing his share, but he's frustrated. The key points here are about balance and mutual respect. The wife is contributing by working and having necessary activities for her well-being. The husband is taking on the childcare responsibilities when she's away. \n\nBut is he wrong for being annoyed? Well, the wife is not violating any agreements. The husband seems to be asking for more shared time, which is valid, but he's not in a position to demand that she stop her activities. The problem might be communication rather than one person being wrong. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's managing his feelings and expressing them, but if he's blaming the wife for her legitimate needs, that's where the issue lies. \n\nThe wife's activities are important for her, and the husband is stepping up to take care of the kids. The husband's desire for family time is understandable, but he might need to adjust his expectations or communicate better. Since he's planning to talk to his wife, it's a relationship matter. However, based on the information, the husband isn't making an unreasonable demand but expressing a valid need. The answer might hinge on whether his frustration is justified. If he's acknowledging her needs while also stating his own, he's not the asshole. But if he's framing her activities as a problem, maybe he is. The answer could be A or B, but I think the key is that both have legitimate needs. The husband isn't in the wrong because he's not asking her to stop her activities, just expressing his feelings. So answer B.\n"
