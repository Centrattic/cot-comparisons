Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that his wife dances twice a week and teaches on Saturdays, plus has other events, leading to him taking care of the kids alone sometimes. He mentions that he doesn't want to go out and prefers family time when they're together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife has her own activities for mental health, which is important. The author is handling most of the childcare duties on those nights. However, he's not asking for help but expressing that he's annoyed because he doesn't want to go out. The key here is whether the wife is fair in suggesting he should go out, given his preference for family time. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to help; he's just choosing not to go out when they are together. The wife's activities are regular and part of her well-being. The author's frustration might be valid if the arrangement feels unequal, but since he's handling the kids on those nights, maybe he's not the asshole. It's a matter of communication and mutual understanding. The answer might be B, No, because he's not wrong for wanting to spend time with family when possible, especially if he's already managing the kids alone other nights.\n"
