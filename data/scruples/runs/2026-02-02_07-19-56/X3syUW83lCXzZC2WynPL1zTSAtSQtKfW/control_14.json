Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. The situation is that the wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has 1-2 other nights out for work events or friends. The author handles childcare during those times, but he's getting annoyed and doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's already taking care of the kids a lot and doesn't want to leave them to go out. He mentions that when they're all home, he wants to spend time with the family. The wife has her own activities for her well-being, which is important. She also offers that he could go out, but he prefers not to.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not refusing to help or being unreasonable about the dance classes, which are part of her routine and mental health. He's handling the kids when she's away, which shows he's cooperative. His issue is that he wants to be with the family when they're together, which is a valid desire. However, he's not asking her to stop her activities but is expressing that he's okay with staying home because he values family time. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is working full-time, dancing, teaching, and has her social activities. It's a balanced approach where both are contributing, but the author feels the burden of childcare when she's away. However, he's not complaining about the dancing itself but the number of nights he's alone. The key point is that he's not asking her to stop her activities, just that he doesn't want to go out when he's already taking care of the kids. \n\nSince both are working full-time and the wife has her own commitments, it's a matter of balancing personal needs. The author isn't being selfish; he's expressing his preference for family time. The wife's suggestion that he could go out isn't something he wants, which is his choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not violating any agreements or being unreasonable. He's just prioritizing family time when he's with them.\n"
