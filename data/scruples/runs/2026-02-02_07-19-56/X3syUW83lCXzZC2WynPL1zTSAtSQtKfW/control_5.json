Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The author mentions that his wife dances two nights, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other engagements. He takes care of the kids on those nights and days, but he's okay with it as long as they are together. However, he feels annoyed when she's away because he doesn't want to go out and prefers family time. His wife suggests he could go out a few nights, but he doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. Both work full-time, and daycare is available during the week. The husband has Fridays off, so the kids are with him then. The wife's dance and teaching activities are part of her routine and well-being. The husband is handling the kids on those nights, which isn't a problem for him, but he's upset about her being away. The question is whether he's wrong for being annoyed.\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and willingness to communicate. The husband says he's okay with her dancing because he knows it's important for her mental health. However, the frequency of her being away (3-4 nights) plus the day care responsibilities on Friday and Saturday might be adding up. The wife's suggestion that he should go out is about balancing the responsibilities, but he doesn't want to. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel supported and that responsibilities are shared to their comfort. The husband's preference for family time isn't necessarily wrong, but if it's causing strain, they need to find a middle ground. The wife's activities might be her way of decompressing, so dismissing her suggestion could be seen as not supporting her needs. \n\nAlso, the husband is already taking care of the kids on those nights. The problem seems more about his desire for time with the wife rather than the actual childcare burden. If the wife is making efforts to balance her time, but he's not open to her taking time for herself, maybe he's being a bit selfish. However, if the wife is not considering his feelings and insists he go out without understanding his preference, that could be an issue too.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the husband not wanting to leave the kids with her. Since he's the one handling the kids when she's out, and he's not complaining about the childcare itself but about her absence, the problem might be more about communication and compromise. The wife's activities are part of her emotional well-being, which is important. The husband wants quality family time, which is also valid. The answer might depend on whether they can find a solution where both needs are met without making the other feel like they're the problem. But based on the situation as presented, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to spend time with his family, especially if he's already taking on the childcare responsibilities. However, if the wife is trying to encourage him to have his own time and he's resistant without valid reasons, that could shift the balance. Here, he does have a valid reason (valuing family time), so maybe he's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
