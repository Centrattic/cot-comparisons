Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with their kids 2-4 nights a week. The author explains that he's taking care of the kids on those nights, including tasks like cooking, baths, and bedtime. He also mentions that he's home with the kids on Fridays and Saturdays while the wife is away dancing or working. He doesn't want to go out because he values family time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both are working full-time, which is a common situation. The wife has a hobby that's important to her mental health, which is valid. She's also teaching on Saturdays, which might be part of the same dance thing. The author is handling the kids on those nights, which can be tiring. But he's not complaining about the actual work itself, just about her leaving him alone. He's not against her dancing or working, but the fact that she's not there with the kids. \n\nNow, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about his annoyance at her being away. He's not asking for help; he's just expressing that he doesn't want her to leave. From a fairness perspective, both partners have needs. The wife needs time for herself, which is healthy. The author also needs family time. It's a balance. \n\nBut is it the author's fault for not wanting to be alone with the kids? Well, he's not refusing to take care of them. He's saying he's okay with doing it, but he's also not getting any alone time. However, he's the one who says he doesn't want to go out. That implies he's choosing not to go out, which might mean he's not asking for the support he needs. Maybe he's not communicating his need for personal time, instead focusing on his wife's actions. \n\nAlso, the wife is working full-time and has her hobbies. She might feel she's contributing by taking care of the kids when she's home. The author might feel like he's doing more childcare, but maybe that's just how their schedules work out. If the problem is about equality in parenting duties, the author might need to discuss that rather than just her leaving him alone. \n\nAnother angle: The author is annoyed that she's away 2-4 nights a week. But he's the one who's home with the kids, so maybe he's in a position where he can enjoy family time. However, he might be feeling isolated or overwhelmed. The issue isn't with her leaving per se, but with the lack of support he feels. \n\nI think part of the problem is communication. The author says he'll talk to his wife, but maybe he needs to express his needs more clearly. If he's not going out because he wants to be with the family, that's his choice, but he might need to discuss how to share responsibilities better. The wife might be doing her part, and the author's annoyance is about a different issue\u2014his own need for personal time, which he's not addressing by staying home. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's not doing anything harmful, but his perspective might be missing the fact that his wife's activities are part of her well-being. He could be expecting her to stay home more when he's home, which might not be fair. Alternatively, he might be in the right if he's feeling overburdened and needs support. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed. Since both need personal time, but he's not seeking a solution, just expressing annoyance, maybe he's not in the wrong, but his approach is not ideal. \n\nHmm, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But perhaps the answer is B (No). The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's his choice to prioritize family time. It's a matter of differing needs and communication. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the answer is likely B.\n"
