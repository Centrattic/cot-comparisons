Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to leave him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has two kids, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has work-related events or friends' nights out. The husband is taking care of the kids on those nights. He mentions he doesn't want to go out because he values family time. He's not asking for the wife to stop her activities, just that he doesn't want to be alone with the kids those nights. He's not angry but wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the husband is being unreasonable. From a fairness perspective, both partners have their own needs. The wife has her hobbies and social activities, which are important for her well-being. The husband is handling childcare on those nights, but he's not complaining about the childcare itself; he's concerned about being alone with the kids and missing out on time together. \n\nHe does acknowledge that he's handling the kids and supports her activities. His request is more about wanting quality family time when they're all together. Since they both work full-time, their time together is limited. His desire for that time isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to. There's a communication issue here. He wants to talk to her about it, which is the right approach. The problem isn't about who's doing more work but about balancing personal needs. Neither is necessarily the \"asshole,\" but the husband isn't wrong for wanting family time. So the answer is B.\n"
