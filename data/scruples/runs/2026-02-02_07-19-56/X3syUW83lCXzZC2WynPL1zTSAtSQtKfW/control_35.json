Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting their wife to leave them alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. The context is that they have two young children, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances twice a week, teaches on Saturdays, and sometimes has other engagements. The husband picks up the kids, does dinner, bedtime, etc., on those nights and days. He's not saying he's unhappy with her dancing but is frustrated because he feels he's doing most of the childcare and doesn't want to leave the family even when they're together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has her own hobbies and social activities, which is important for her well-being. It's common for people to need personal time, especially with the stress of full-time work and parenting. The husband is taking on a lot of childcare duties when she's away. But he's not angry about the dancing itself\u2014he says he understands and appreciates her need for it. His issue is that he's doing all the work and doesn't get time to himself, and he's not interested in going out. \n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities and the communication between the couple. The husband mentions he plans to talk to his wife, which is a good step. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the problem is that the current arrangement isn't balanced. If he's taking care of the kids 3-4 nights a week, plus Fridays and Saturdays, while the wife is out, but he doesn't get similar time, that's an issue. However, he's not asking for help; he's expressing that he doesn't want to be alone with the kids. It's possible that the wife's activities are within reasonable bounds, but the husband might feel overwhelmed. \n\nAnother angle is that the wife is offering for him to go out when she's home, but he doesn't want to. That shows he values family time, which is understandable. However, it's important that both partners have time for themselves. If the husband isn't using that time to recharge, it might lead to resentment. \n\nBut the question is whether he's wrong for being annoyed. Since he's not angry about her dancing but about the number of nights he's left alone, maybe the issue is about shared responsibilities and mutual support. The wife might need her activities, but the husband is shouldering most of the childcare. It's possible that they need a better division of labor. However, the husband's stance is that he doesn't want to go out because he wants family time. So, is he wrong for not wanting to leave the kids even when he could?\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the current setup is sustainable and if there's an imbalance. The husband isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way, but maybe they need to find a compromise. The wife's activities are part of her well-being, so cutting them down isn't ideal. The husband might need to accept that sometimes he'll be alone with the kids, but they might need to adjust schedules so he can have some time too. \n\nSince the user is asking if he's the asshole, and given that he's not hostile toward her activities but is struggling with the workload and desire for family time, I'd lean toward him not being wrong. It's a common situation where both partners have needs that aren't perfectly aligned, but he's communicating his feelings and plans to talk. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
