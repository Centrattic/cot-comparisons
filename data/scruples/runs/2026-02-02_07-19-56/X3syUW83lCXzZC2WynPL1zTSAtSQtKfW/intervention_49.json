Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole for being annoyed that my wife leaves me alone with the kids 2-4 nights per week?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who is frustrated that his wife is leaving him alone with the kids 2-4 nights a week. They have two young children, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. The wife dances two nights a week, teaches on Saturdays, and has other activities like work dinners or friends' events. The husband takes care of the kids during these times and doesn't want to go out because he values family time. The wife suggests he could go out, but he doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. Both parents work full-time, so splitting childcare duties is common. The wife's activities are important for her mental health, which is crucial. The husband is handling the kids on those nights and days, which is a lot, but he seems okay with it except for the nights when the wife is out. The key point is whether his frustration is valid. \n\nHe mentions that when they're all together, he wants to spend time with the family. That's understandable. However, expecting the wife to never leave him alone with the kids might be unrealistic, especially if she has her own needs and responsibilities. The wife is contributing by taking the kids on Fridays and part of Saturdays. The husband might feel overwhelmed, but it's important to communicate and find a middle ground. \n\nIs he in the wrong for being annoyed? Maybe not entirely. It's reasonable to feel overwhelmed when handling multiple childcare duties alone. However, the wife has her own legitimate reasons for her activities. The husband's request isn't about fairness but about his need for family time. The wife is already doing her part by taking the kids on some days. The problem might be in the communication. The husband should discuss his feelings without making it about blame. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not asking for more help but just expressing his feelings, he might not be the asshole. However, if he's expecting the wife to stop all her activities to accommodate his desire for family time, that could be unreasonable. The answer might hinge on whether his expectations are fair given their circumstances. Since both have their own needs and responsibilities, it's a shared responsibility. The husband might need to adjust his expectations or find ways to manage the childcare duties, possibly with additional support if possible. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. Both parties have valid points. The issue is more about balancing their needs and communicating effectively. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
