We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for a broken table. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's SO's coworker offered to board their two dogs for $200. They paid $300 as a thank you because they were going to pay $700 for a professional service. The coworker was supposed to care for the dogs properly, with specific instructions about feeding, exercise, and not keeping them caged all day.\n\nThe problems that arose: The large dog lost a significant amount of weight, the cage had a hole chewed by the dog, and the small dog might have been fed the same amount as the large one. Also, the dog got into something that made him vomit, and when trying to clean up, the dog broke an expensive table by being tied to it. The cowokers asked for money for the table, but the author refused.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying for the table. The author argues that the care provided was subpar\u2014starving the dogs, caging them too long, leading to the dog chewing the cage and breaking the table when tied up. The coworker didn't follow the care instructions, which the author had given. The author feels they already paid $300, which was more than the original offer, and the care was worse than expected. They also mention the vet costs and the poor treatment of the dogs.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, typically, when a pet causes damage while under someone else's care, the caretaker might be liable if they didn't follow proper care guidelines. The author's argument is that the coworker was negligent in the care, leading the dog to act out. If the table was broken due to the coworker's negligence (tying the dog up improperly), then the coworker might be responsible for the damage.\n\nEthically, the author isn't in the wrong because the coworker didn't meet the agreed-upon care standards. The $300 was a thank you, but the care was inadequate. The coworker's actions leading to the table's damage (tying the dog up outside, which wasn't part of the agreed exercise) were their responsibility. The author's refusal to pay more is justified given the poor treatment and potential harm to their pets.\n\nAlso, the coworker's nonchalant attitude about the dog's illness and scolding the dog for the mess adds to the negligence. The author prioritized their dog's health over financial compensation, which is understandable. The vet advice and taking care of the dog's health should be a priority over paying for an unnecessary expense caused by the sitter's mistake.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The coworker failed to provide proper care and their actions directly led to the table being broken, so the author isn't responsible for that damage.\n"
