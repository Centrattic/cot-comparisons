We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying the coworker for a broken table. The situation involves a dog sitter (the coworker) who was paid $300 to take care of two dogs for two weeks. The author claims the dogs were mistreated, leading to weight loss, being caged too long, and even poisoned by the dog sitter's negligence. The coworker then asked for more money after the dog broke their table.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities of both parties. The author and their SO provided care instructions, gave dog food and money for more, and trusted the coworker to follow through. The coworker didn't follow the feeding instructions, leading to the large dog losing significant weight. The large dog's cage was damaged, implying he was left in it for too long. Additionally, the coworker's wife let the dog into a bag of harmful substances, causing vomiting. The author then refuses to pay for the broken table, which the coworker claims the dog caused by pulling the leash tied to the table.\n\nThe key points here are the negligence by the dog sitter. The author's dogs were harmed due to the sitter's failure to provide proper care. The coworker's actions (tying the dog to the table, not feeding correctly, letting the dog access harmful substances) are clear faults. The broken table was a result of the sitter's method of restraint, which wasn't part of the agreed-upon care. The author's refusal to pay for the table is based on the coworker's negligence and the poor treatment of the dogs.\n\nLegally, if the dog sitter is negligent in their duties, they might be responsible for any damages caused by the dog, including the table. The author's main issue is the mistreatment of the dogs, which the coworker is at fault for. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying; in fact, they might have a case against the sitter for compensation for the dogs' harm. The coworker's request for additional money is inappropriate given their negligence. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because the coworker failed to properly care for the dogs, leading to the incident with the table. The answer should be B.\n"
