We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for the broken table. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the SO and their partner were going to travel for two weeks and arranged for a coworker to board their two dogs for $200. They gave him $300, originally considering professional boarding at $700, wanting to show gratitude. The dogs have specific care needs: the big one needs daily walks and exercise, the small one needs frequent potty breaks. The big one can't be in a cage all day as it causes stress. \n\nThey provided half a bag of dog food and an extra $100 to buy more, even though the food was only worth $30. The coworker said he didn't need to buy more, but the remaining food was only a quarter full. This makes the author think the dogs were fed the same amount, leading the big one to lose a lot of weight. The small dog actually gained weight, which is a clue here. \n\nThen the big dog's cage had a hole chewed through, suggesting he was caged for too long. On the day they picked up the dogs, the big one was vomiting, and the sitters blamed the dog for getting into brown sugar and cocoa powder, scolding him for ruining the carpet. The author didn't pay for the broken table, arguing that the sitters tied the dog up outside, which isn't proper exercise, and that the care was inadequate (starving, caging too long, leading to the accident). They think they should have used a professional facility and are now considering that in the future.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for not paying for the table? Let's analyze. \n\nThe sitters were responsible for the care of the dogs. The author provided instructions and even gave more money. However, the sitters didn't follow the care instructions properly. They caged the big dog too long (chewed through the cage), underfed him (leading to weight loss), and left food that could be dangerous. The table was broken because the sitters tied the dog to it, which led to the dog pulling it over. \n\nIf the sitters had followed the care instructions, maybe the situation wouldn't have happened. The dog pulling the table down might be a result of being stressed or overchewed due to improper exercise. The author's argument is that the sitters were negligent in their care, leading to the dog's distress and the subsequent breaking of the table. \n\nLegally, if the sitters caused the damage by their negligence, the owner might not be responsible. But the question is more about whether it's fair or morally right, not legal. The author feels they were overcharged (since they paid $300 for $200 service), and the care was subpar. The sitters are now asking for more money for a broken table, but the author is not paying because they believe the sitters were at fault. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The sitters didn't follow the care instructions, leading to the dog's stress and damage. 2) The table was broken due to their method of securing the dog. 3) The author provided more than the agreed upon payment. \n\nIf the sitters had done their job properly, the dog might not have been stressed enough to pull the table down. The author might have a valid point that the sitters' neglect caused the incident. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because the sitters didn't fulfill their responsibilities. The answer should be B for No.\n"
