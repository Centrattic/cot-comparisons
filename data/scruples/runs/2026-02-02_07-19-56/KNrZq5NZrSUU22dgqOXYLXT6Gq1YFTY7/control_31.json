We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they left their dogs with a coworker for two weeks, and now the coworker is asking for money because the dog broke an expensive table. The author didn't pay and is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at who's responsible for the broken table. The coworker tied the dog's leash to the table. The dog was tied to the table, and when the dog tried to get free, the table shattered. The author's dog was tied to something that ended up breaking. If the coworker tied the dog to the table, maybe that's their responsibility. They knew the dog needed exercise, so tying it to a table wouldn't be proper care. Also, the author had specified that the big dog needed to be walked daily and not left in a cage all day. The coworker didn't follow the care instructions, instead of providing exercise, they tied the dog to the table, leading to the breakage. So the coworker might be at fault for not following the care plan and for creating a situation where the table could be broken.\n\nThen there's the part about the dog being underfed. The author provided food and extra money, but the coworker didn't buy more, leading to the dog losing a lot of weight. This negligence could be part of the reason the dog was stressed or anxious, maybe leading to the leash-pulling incident. The coworker's failure to provide proper care (food and exercise) might have contributed to the dog's behavior that caused the table to break.\n\nAlso, the coworker gave the nonchalant response about the dog getting into the brown sugar and coco powder. That suggests they didn't take proper care to secure their home, allowing the dog access to something harmful. Maybe they left the bag out where the dog could reach it. If the table was broken because the dog was tied to it and tried to get away (possibly due to the stress from being underfed and caged), the coworker's negligence in care and supervision is the root cause.\n\nThe author did give the coworker money, food, and instructions. The coworker didn't follow through properly, leading to multiple issues with the dogs' health and the table. The author is standing by their decision not to pay for the table because they believe the coworker was negligent in caring for the dogs, which led to the incident. \n\nSo the main question is: was tying the dog to the table the coworker's fault, and does that make them responsible for the damage? Since the author had already provided specific care instructions and the coworker didn't follow them, the responsibility for the table's damage would lie with the coworker. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay for the table because the coworker's negligence in proper care caused the situation.\n"
