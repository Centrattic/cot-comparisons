We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who had their dogs boarded by a coworker's place for two weeks. The coworker, let's call him the dog sitter, ended up damaging a glass table with the big dog. The main question is whether the author is at fault for not paying for the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The couple paid the coworker $300 for the boarding, which was less than the $700 they would have paid a professional facility. The coworker was supposed to provide proper care, including feeding the dogs correctly, taking them out, and giving them enough exercise. The author claims that the dogs were underfed, kept in cages for too long, and even made to vomit by accessing something toxic. On top of that, the big dog broke a table when it was tied to it.\n\nThe author didn't pay for the table, arguing that the care was substandard. The dog sitter claims the table is expensive and wants compensation. The author's reasoning is that they're not responsible because the sitter failed in their duties, and they were already overpaying compared to a pro facility. But is that a valid defense?\n\nSo, legal-wise, when someone pays someone else to care for their pets, there's an implied contract. The sitter is supposed to provide proper care. If they fail in that duty, they might be negligent. But does that negate their responsibility for any damage the pet causes during their care? That's tricky.\n\nIn most cases, if a pet causes damage while in someone else's care, the owner is usually still responsible unless the sitter was at fault. However, here, the sitter's method of tying the dog to the table could be a factor. Tying a dog in a way that leads to it damaging property might be considered their responsibility, especially if the method was unsafe. Also, if the sitter didn't follow the care instructions (like underfeeding and caging too long), that's negligence on their part.\n\nBut the author didn't pay for the table. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. The author's argument is that the sitter didn't provide proper care, so they shouldn't be held responsible for additional costs. However, the table was broken by the dog under their supervision, so the owner might still be liable unless the sitter's negligence directly caused the damage. If the sitter's improper care (like tying the dog inappropriately) led to the table breaking, then the sitter could be at fault. \n\nBut legally, pet owners are generally liable for their pets' actions, even when they're with a sitter. So the author might be expected to pay for the table. However, the quality of care was poor, which complicates things. The author could argue that the sitter's negligence contributed to the dog's behavior, but it's not clear if that directly caused the table to break. Also, the author could claim that the sitter's failure to follow instructions (feeding, caging) was a breach of their agreement, which might void the sitter's claim for the table damage. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the sitter didn't take proper care of the dogs, then expecting payment for the table seems unfair. But ethically, the author might still have a responsibility for the damage caused by their dog, especially if the sitter followed all the care instructions except for the specific incident of tying the dog to the table. However, in this case, the sitter failed in multiple areas, which weakens their claim.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The sitter's negligence in care could mean that the author isn't responsible for the table. Alternatively, if the table was broken due to the dog's own behavior, the owner is usually liable. But the sitter's actions in tying the dog might have contributed. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the sitter's overall failure to provide proper care, the author's decision not to pay could be justified.\n"
