We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for the broken table. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's partner and they hired a coworker's wife to take care of their two dogs for two weeks. They paid $300, which was $100 more than the $200 quote, as a token of gratitude. The coworker had agreed to provide care, including feeding, walks, and exercise. However, upon returning, the large dog was severely underweight, the cage was destroyed, and the dog had vomited after eating something harmful. The coworkers then asked the author to pay for a broken table that their dog had supposedly broken by getting tied to it.\n\nThe author decided not to pay for the table, arguing that the care was subpar and that the coworkers were negligent. They believe the dog was starved, kept in cages too long, and poisoned. The coworkers, on the other hand, are asking for money for the table.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not paying. Let's consider a few points:\n\n1. **Negligence and Responsibility**: The coworkers were supposed to care for the dogs properly. If they tied the dog to a table and it broke, that's their responsibility. The author might argue that the method of restraint (tying to a table) was inappropriate, contributing to the damage.\n\n2. **Contract and Expectations**: The author paid for the service, expecting proper care. The coworkers didn't meet the agreed-upon care standards, leading to harm to the dogs. The author could argue that the coworkers breached the contract, so any damages caused by their negligence shouldn't be the author's responsibility.\n\n3. **Compensation for Damage**: If the dog broke the table due to the coworkers' negligence (like improper restraint), the responsibility for the table's damage falls on the caregivers. The author isn't liable for damage that resulted from the caregivers' failure to follow proper care instructions.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: The author is withholding payment for the table as a form of retribution for the poor care. While not paying might not be legally required, ethically, if the situation is clear that the caregivers were at fault, the author might be justified in not paying.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the table was broken because the dog was acting out of normal behavior (chewing, pulling), which is inherent to the pet, the author might have some liability. But given that the caregivers tied the dog in a way that led to the table breaking, it's their fault. The author's instructions about exercise and not to cage them all day were ignored, leading to the dog's stress and destructive behavior.\n\nIn terms of legal liability, generally, the pet owner could be liable for their pet's actions unless the damage was due to the caregiver's negligence. Here, the caregivers' negligence in feeding, exercise, and restraint likely led to the dog's behavior that broke the table. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying for the table because the damage was a result of the caregivers' failure to properly care for the dog.\n\nSo, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
