We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't pay for the broken table is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's SO's coworker agreed to take care of their dogs for two weeks in exchange for $200, but they paid $300 as a thank you. The coworker ended up not providing proper care, including feeding the dogs incorrectly, keeping them in cages too long, and the dog got into their table, breaking it. The authors didn't pay for the table.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault for not paying. \n\nLet me consider both sides. Legally, if the dog broke the table while in their care, the owner is usually responsible. But in this case, the caregivers tied the dog to the table, which contributed to the accident. So maybe they share some blame. \n\nMorally, the caregivers didn't follow the care instructions, leading to the dog's poor condition. The authors had a bad experience and felt the request for payment was inappropriate. They might not feel obligated to pay because of the negligence. \n\nBut ethically, even if the caregivers were negligent, the dog is the owner's responsibility. However, the way the table was broken (tying the dog to it) could be considered part of their negligence. So the authors might have valid grounds to refuse payment because the caregivers didn't fulfill their part of the agreement properly. \n\nAlso, the original agreement was $200 for boarding, but the authors paid $300 as a thank you. The $300 was more of a generous payment, so expecting more from them might be unreasonable. Plus, the caregivers didn't meet the care standards, so the authors might argue they didn't deliver the agreed-upon service. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the caregivers made a mistake that led to the table breaking, but the dog's behavior (chewing, etc.) might have been a factor too. However, the main issue is the poor care leading to the dog's health issues. \n\nConsidering all this, the authors might not be in the wrong for not paying because the caregivers were negligent in their duties. The request for payment could be seen as adding insult to injury. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
