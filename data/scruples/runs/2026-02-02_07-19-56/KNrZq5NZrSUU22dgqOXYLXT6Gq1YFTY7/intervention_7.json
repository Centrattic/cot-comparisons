We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a coworker to dog-sit their two dogs for two weeks for $200, but they paid $300 as a thank you. The dogs came back in bad shape\u2014underfed, stressed, and the big dog had a broken cage and even got sick. Then the dog broke their expensive table, and the dog sitters asked for money, which the author refused.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not paying for the broken table. The dog sitters tied the dog's leash to the table, which caused it to break. The author argues that the sitters didn't follow the care instructions, like not providing enough exercise, feeding the dogs inadequately, and keeping them caged too long. The author feels like the sitters were negligent, so the broken table is on them.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the dog is a pet, the owner is usually responsible for damages the dog causes. But here, the sitters had control of the dog and created the situation by tying the leash to the table. That might shift responsibility to the sitters. Also, the author points out that the care was subpar, so the sitters might have breached their agreement. If the sitters weren't following the agreed-upon care instructions, the author could argue that the sitters are negligent, and thus responsible for the table damage. \n\nAdditionally, the author didn't receive the services they paid for. The dogs were underfed and stressed, which is a serious issue. The sitters might have been negligent in their duties, which could void any responsibility the author has for the table. Also, the sitters asked for money after providing poor care, which could be seen as taking advantage. The author's refusal to pay is a way to hold the sitters accountable for their negligence.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about fairness. The sitters failed in their responsibilities, and the author is withholding payment for the table as a form of leverage. While the dog caused the damage, the sitters' actions (tying the leash) directly led to it. The author might feel justified in not paying because the sitters aren't trustworthy or responsible. \n\nHowever, in some places, pet owners are still liable for their pets' actions regardless of who was in charge. But if the sitters had control and created the situation, the liability could be on them. The author might not be in the wrong here because the sitters didn't follow the agreed terms and the damage was a result of their own actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily at fault. They provided the care instructions, and the sitters didn't follow them. The broken table happened due to the sitters' choice to tie the dog to the table. The author's refusal to pay is a response to the sitters' negligence. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
