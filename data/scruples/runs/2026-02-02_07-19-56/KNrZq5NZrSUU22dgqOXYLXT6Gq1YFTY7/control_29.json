We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for the broken table. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's SO's coworker offered to board their two dogs for $200. They paid $300 as a token of gratitude since they were saving money compared to professional boarding. They gave instructions on feeding, exercise, and other care. Upon returning, they found the large dog underfed, the cage damaged, and the dog vomiting. Then, the sitters asked for more money because the dog broke their table.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not paying for the table. Let's consider the key points. \n\nThe sitters tied the dog's leash to the table, leading to it breaking. The author argues that this wasn't proper exercise. The dogs were left in cages for long periods, leading to stress and underfeeding. The sitters didn't follow the care instructions given. The table incident was due to the sitters' decision to tie the dog, which seems negligent. \n\nLegally, if the sitters were providing a service for a fee, they might be responsible for damages caused by their negligence. The author's dogs were under their care, so they might be liable for any damage the dogs caused during their stay. Plus, the sitters didn't adhere to the care instructions, which could make them responsible for the dog's condition. \n\nThe author isn't at fault for the table breaking because the sitters' method of restraint caused the damage. Also, the sitters didn't inform them about the table before damaging it. The author could argue that the sitters are responsible for the damage as part of their care. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the sitters didn't provide proper care, leading to the dog's health issues. The author's refusal to pay for the table is a response to poor service and negligence. It's a reasonable stance since the sitters can't just pass on the cost without accountability for their actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The sitters made poor decisions that led to the table breaking and the dogs' mistreatment. The author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
