We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a coworker to take care of their two dogs for two weeks. The coworker was supposed to provide proper care, which included feeding them correctly, taking them out for walks, and making sure they have enough exercise. The author gave the coworker $300, which was supposed to cover the cost since they initially had a $700 professional boarding plan and wanted to show gratitude. They also gave them dog food and extra money to buy more, expecting that they would need it.\n\nNow, when they came back, the big dog had lost a lot of weight, which suggests he wasn't fed enough. The small dog was bigger, which makes the author think they were fed the same amount as the big one, which probably isn't right because different sizes need different portions. The big dog's cage had a hole chewed through, implying he was left in there too long. Then there was the incident with the dog getting into the sugar and cocoa powder, which led to vomiting. The coworker then asked the author to pay for a broken table they tied the dog to, but the author refused because they felt the care was inadequate.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the author is responsible for the broken table. The coworker tied the dog to the table, which led to it breaking. The author's argument is that the coworker didn't follow the care instructions, which included proper exercise and not putting the dog in a situation where he could harm himself or their property. The coworker's negligence in feeding and caring for the dogs might have contributed to the dog's stress or behavior that caused the table to break. Also, the fact that they tied the dog up outside wasn't part of the agreed-upon exercise plan, which could be a factor.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the person who was supposed to care for the dog didn't meet the agreed-upon terms, they might be at fault. The author isn't responsible for the coworker's negligence. The broken table was a result of the coworker's decision to tie the dog to it, which wasn't part of the original arrangement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying for the table because the coworker didn't provide proper care and created a situation that led to the damage. The author is standing up for their dogs and not compensating for the coworker's own mistakes.\n"
