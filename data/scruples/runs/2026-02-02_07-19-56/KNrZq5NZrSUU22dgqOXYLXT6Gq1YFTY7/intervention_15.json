We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter after their dog broke a table. The situation is complex, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author and their SO paid a coworker $300 to take care of their two dogs for two weeks. The coworker was supposed to provide proper care, including feeding, exercise, and not caging the dogs for too long. The author gave them dog food and extra money to buy more. However, when they returned, the big dog had lost a significant amount of weight, the cage was chewed through, and the small dog seemed bigger, suggesting they were fed the same amount as the larger one. Also, the big dog got into a bag of brown sugar and cocoa powder, causing vomiting, and the coworker tied the dog's leash to a table which broke.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying for the broken table. The coworker claims the dog broke it when trying to escape. The author argues that the coworkers didn't follow the care instructions by caging the dog too long, leading to stress, and then improperly tied him outside, resulting in the broken table. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the dog was under the care of the sitter, the responsibility for any damage caused by the dog might fall on the sitter, especially if they mishandled the dog. The author could argue that the sitter's negligence (underfeeding, caging too long, improper restraint) led to the incident. However, if the agreement was that the sitter is responsible for any damage caused by the dog during their care, then the author might be expected to pay. \n\nBut looking at the care provided, there's clear negligence. The dogs were underfed, improperly caged, and the sitters didn't follow the exercise routines. The fact that the dog was tied to a table with a leash, which allowed it to pull the table down, suggests the sitters didn't manage the situation properly. The author has valid reasons to believe the sitters were negligent. Therefore, the author might not be at fault for not paying for the table as it was a result of the sitters' poor care. \n\nAdditionally, the initial payment of $300 was an act of goodwill, and the sitters failed to provide the agreed-upon service. The author's refusal to pay for the table could be seen as a response to the sitters' failure to care for the dogs properly. Thus, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
