We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for the table their dog broke. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's SO's coworker offered to board their dogs for $200. They paid $300, intending to show gratitude since they had planned to spend $700 at a professional facility. The dogs were supposed to get proper care, but upon returning, they found the large dog underweight, the cage damaged, and the small dog possibly overfed. The coworker's wife mentioned the dog got into a bag of brown sugar and cocoa powder. Then, when picking up the dog, the dog broke their table by being tied to it, and they asked for compensation.\n\nThe author didn't pay for the table, instead telling them they'd send a vet bill if needed. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, key points here: Did the author's dog cause the damage? Yes, by breaking the table. But the context is important. The dog was tied to the table, which might be a factor. Also, there's a history of poor care from the sitter\u2014feeding issues, caging the dogs too long, not following the care instructions. The author's main argument is that the sitters were negligent, leading to their dog's health issues and the table incident.\n\nLegally, if the dog caused the damage, the owner is typically liable. However, if the sitters tied the dog to the table improperly, leading to the accident, the liability might shift. Additionally, the sitters didn't follow the care instructions, which could void any responsibility the owner has for the damage. The author's decision not to pay could be based on the sitters' negligence.\n\nEthically, considering the sitters provided substandard care, the author might feel justified in not compensating them for their own negligence. The sitters' demands for payment might be seen as taking advantage of the situation where they failed in their duty.\n\nSo, the author's refusal to pay is based on the sitters' negligence. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons to withhold payment due to the sitters' failure to provide proper care.\n"
