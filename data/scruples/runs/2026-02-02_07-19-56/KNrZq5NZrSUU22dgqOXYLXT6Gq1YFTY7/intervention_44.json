We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should pay for the broken table. Let me break down the key points from the story.\n\nFirst, the author's SO's coworker offered to board their two dogs for $200. The author gave them $300 as a thank you, which was more than the original plan of $700 at a professional facility. So, there's a sense of gratitude and maybe some expectation of better care.\n\nThe care instructions were given: big dog needs exercise, small one needs frequent potty breaks. The coworker was provided with dog food and extra money to buy more. But when they returned, the big dog was underweight, the cage had a hole (suggesting prolonged confinement), and the small dog was bigger, implying unequal feeding. Also, the dog got into some dangerous items causing a vet situation.\n\nThen, the coworker asked for money because the table was broken by the dog when tied to it. The author refused, citing the poor care before.\n\nThe question is if the author is at fault for not paying the table. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The coworker's argument is that the dog broke the table, so the owner is responsible. The author's counter is that the care was substandard, with neglect leading to health issues and improper confinement. \n\nLegally, when someone boards a pet, they might be responsible for damages caused by the pet. However, there's also a case here of the caretaker possibly not following the agreed-upon care instructions, leading to the dog's distress and subsequent damage. The act of tying the dog to a table with a leash, which led to the table breaking, might be considered negligence on the coworker's part. If the dog was left in a cage all day (as the hole suggests), that's not the exercise the author provided for. The coworker's failure to properly supervise or manage the dog could be the root cause of the incident. \n\nAdditionally, the author didn't get a fair service for the money paid, so there's a breach of the agreement. The bad treatment of the dog (starving, poor feeding, confinement) could be seen as a reason the dog was stressed and might have acted out. The coworker's actions (leashing to a table) directly caused the damage. \n\nSo in terms of responsibility: the author had the right to expect proper care, which wasn't provided. The coworker's negligence in care led to the dog being tied up and causing damage. Therefore, the author isn't at fault for the table breaking because the coworker didn't follow care instructions, leading to the situation. The author's refusal to pay is justified as they didn't get the agreed service and the coworker's actions caused the damage. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
