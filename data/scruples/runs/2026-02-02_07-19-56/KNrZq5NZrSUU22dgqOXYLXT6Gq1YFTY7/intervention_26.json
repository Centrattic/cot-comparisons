We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for the broken table.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation. The author's SO's coworker offered to board their two dogs for $200, and they paid $300 as a thank you, considering the professional boarding would cost $700. The coworker was supposed to follow specific care instructions: feeding, exercise, etc. However, the dogs were underfed, kept in cages too long, and one got sick from eating something they shouldn't have. Then, the coworker claims the large dog broke their expensive table when tied to it, asking for money. The author refused to pay and felt justified because of the poor care.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is at fault for not paying for the table. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Agreement and Responsibility**: The author gave the coworker $300 for two weeks of care. The coworkers didn't mention the table cost in their agreement. The table was broken when they tied the dog's leash to it. The author's instructions were about exercise and feeding, not tying the dog up. So, the coworkers didn't follow the care instructions, which might make the table incident their fault.\n\n2. **Negligence in Care**: The author provided clear care instructions, but the coworkers didn't follow them. The dog was underfed and kept caged, leading to stress and possibly destructive behavior. If the table breaking was due to the dog being tied up (which is not proper exercise), the coworkers are responsible for that setup.\n\n3. **Compensation Request**: The coworkers asked for money after the fact, but the author refused, citing the poor care. The author's argument is that the coworkers didn't follow the agreed-upon care, leading to the problem. The table was broken due to their method of restraint, which they shouldn't have done. Therefore, the author isn't responsible for that damage.\n\n4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Typically, if someone agrees to care for a pet, they're responsible for any damage the pet causes while in their care, unless it's due to their own negligence. However, the coworkers didn't follow the care instructions, so their negligence in tying the dog up (and causing stress) might make them liable for the table's damage. The author isn't responsible for their own pet's actions if the care provided was inadequate.\n\n5. **Moral Argument**: The author prioritized the well-being of their dogs over paying for the table. The coworkers provided poor care, which could lead to the dog acting out (chewing the cage, vomiting from eating harmful substances). The table incident might be a result of their negligence in handling the dog.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't at fault because the coworkers failed to follow the care instructions, leading to the dog's distress and subsequent damage. The author is within their rights to refuse payment for damage caused by the sitter's negligence. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
