We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for a broken table. The story is about the person and their SO using a coworker's offer to board their dogs for $200 instead of professional boarding which would have cost $700. They gave $300 upfront, which included $70 more than the cost of the food they had left. The dogs came back in bad shape\u2014underfed, stressed, and one even had an accident with a table breaking. The dog sitter then asked for money to replace the table.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The user argues that the dog sitter didn't follow the care instructions, leading to the dog being underfed and caged too long, which caused the dog to chew through the cage and possibly led to the table breaking incident. The user didn't pay for the table and instead focused on the neglect and poisoning (the dog ate brown sugar and cocoa powder, which isn't good for dogs). They feel they shouldn't be responsible for the table because the sitter used improper methods, like tying up the dog outside, which isn't the exercise they agreed to. \n\nLegally, if the dog sitter breached the agreement by not providing proper care, leading to the dog's deterioration and the table breaking as a result, the responsibility might lie with the sitter. However, depending on the terms of the agreement, the user might still be liable for damages caused by the dog. But ethically, the sitter's actions in not following the care instructions and allowing the dog to be tied up, which caused the accident, could be their fault. The user provided clear instructions and the sitter's negligence may have contributed to the dog's behavior. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned that they gave money for dog food, but the sitter didn't use it appropriately, leading to the dogs being underfed. This suggests the sitter didn't fulfill their part of the agreement. The poisoning incident seems like direct negligence because cocoa powder is toxic to dogs. The user's refusal to pay for the table might be justified if the sitter's actions caused the damage. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the table was broken because the dog was tied to it and pulled it down, the user might be liable if the dog sitter used a method that the user didn't agree to. However, the user's original instructions were to take the dog on walks and not to leave them caged all day. The sitter's method of tying the dog outside contradicts the agreed-upon care, which could be part of the problem. \n\nSo, the user didn't pay for the table and is sending the vet bill. The sitter's negligence in care and the method they used to handle the dog (tying it outside leading to the table breaking and the poisoning) seems to be their fault. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying for the table. The answer is B.\n"
