We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their SO left their dogs with a coworker for two weeks. The coworker asked for $200, but they paid $300 as a thank you. The main issue now is that the coworker is asking for more money because their dog broke an expensive table. The author refuses to pay, citing that the care was inadequate and negligent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author provided care instructions, gave food and money for more, but the dogs were underfed. The large dog lost a lot of weight, which suggests the coworker didn't follow the feeding instructions. The cage had a hole chewed through, implying the dog was left in it too long. Also, the dog got into toxic substances (brown sugar and coco powder), which could be negligence. Then the coworker tied the dog's leash to a table, which broke when the dog tried to get free.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the care was bad, and they have evidence of negligence. They're being asked to pay for the table damage, but they feel it's justified not to pay given the poor treatment of the dogs. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the dog was tied up and caused damage, the owner is generally liable. But here, there might be a breach of contract or negligence from the dog sitter. The author might argue that the sitter wasn't following proper care, leading to the damage. However, the table incident was a direct result of the sitter's decision to tie the dog, which might make the author still liable.\n\nEthically, the sitter didn't follow the care instructions, leading to harm and damage. The author could argue that the sitter's negligence caused the problem, so the sitter is at fault. But legally, the owner might still be responsible unless the sitter is at fault. However, if the sitter was negligent in their duty, they might be responsible for the damage, not the owner.\n\nThe author's refusal to pay is based on the poor care. They mention the vet costs and the damage caused by the sitter's actions. If the table was broken because the sitter improperly tied the dog up, then the sitter is responsible for the damage, not the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the sitter's negligence led to the table breaking. The author could even argue that the sitter should cover the vet costs due to their negligence.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The sitter's negligence in care and handling the dog caused the damage, so the author isn't responsible for the table, and their refusal to pay is justified given the poor treatment of the dogs.\n"
