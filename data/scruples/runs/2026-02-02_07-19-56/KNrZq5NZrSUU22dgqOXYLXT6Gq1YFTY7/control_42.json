We gave him $300 because we were originally planning on having them stay at professional boarding for about $700 and we wanted to show our gratitude for his kind offer. \n\n\nOur dogs are generally easy going as long as the big one gets to run around outside and taken on walks daily and the little one gets taken out every couple hours to potty (he\u2019s about 75% trained but still has some accidents). They sleep in their cages at night and when we\u2019re away from the house for a couple hours but they can\u2019t be in their cages an entire day or they\u2019ll get really stressed out (as most dogs would).\n\nWe gave them (the coworker and his wife) the remainder of our dog food (about half a bag that should last a week between the two of them) and $100 to pick up some more. The food costs about $30 but since we were short on time we gave them the extra $70 for the trouble of getting more.\n\n\nWe made sure to let them know all the proper care instructions such as when and how much to feed them, when to take them out, how much exercise they need etc. and they assured us they were okay with all of it and would take care of it. \n\n\nWe came back 2 weeks later and our large dog looked like he lost about 15 lbs. His ribs and spine were prominent and he\u2019d lost most of his muscle mass. The coworker gave us the remaining dog food and said that he didn\u2019t need to buy an extra bag after all. The bag was a quarter way full still, and we gave it to him initially half empty, fully expecting they\u2019d need to get more. Our small dog looked a bit bigger which leads me to believe that they fed our 13 lbs dog and our 65 lbs dog the same amount of food a day. \n\nOur large dog\u2019s cage also had a massive hole at the bottom where it looked like he literally chewed through it, it was completely unusable. This makes me think they had them locked in their cages for very long periods of time. \n\n\nTo top it off, the day we came to pick them up our big guy was vomiting all over their house. I was so shocked and worried and asked what happened and the coworker\u2019s wife nonchalantly states that \u201che got into a bag of brown sugar and coco powder this morning\u201d and she made sure to emphasize how big of a mess it made. \n\n\nAs he\u2019s vomiting they scold him for \u201cruining their carpet\u201d \n\nWe help clean up the vomit and rush home. We called an emergency vet line and they told us if he doesn\u2019t stop throwing up the next day to bring him in, which he luckily seemed to get better and was drinking enough fluids. \n\nWe get a text from them that day saying something along the lines of \u201cHey, your dog broke an expensive glass table we had outside that\u2019s worth way more than $300, so if you could throw some money our way that would be great\u201d\n\n\nWe asked how he broke it and they said that they tied our dog\u2019s leash to the table to keep him outside and he pulled it down when trying to break away and it completely shattered. \n\n\nWe completely ignored the fact that they asked us for money and told them if we need to take our dog to the vet that we\u2019d be sending them our vet bill. \n\n\nAITA for not paying for their expensive table? I am 100% not okay that they tied my dog up outside as this is not the \u201cexercise\u201d I was talking about. I feel like we spent $400 to have these people starve our dogs, leave them in their cages for 2 weeks and poison them to top it off. I would have much rather spent $700 on proper care in a professional facility and will definitely be doing so in the future if we ever need to travel again. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the dog sitter for the broken table. \n\nFirst, the background: The author's SO's coworker offered to board their two dogs for $200, and they gave $300 as a thank you. The dogs have specific care needs. The coworker didn't follow the care instructions\u2014fed them the same amount regardless of size, kept them caged too long, leading to weight loss, and tied the dog to a table which broke. The coworker then asked for more money for the table. The author refused, thinking they were already underpaid.\n\nSo, the main points here are about responsibility. Did the dog sitter do something wrong that led to the table breaking? If they tied the dog to the table improperly, that's their fault. The author had given instructions for exercise and proper care, and the sitter didn't follow them, leading to the dog's health issues and the table incident. \n\nLegally, maybe the table is a separate issue. If the sitter's negligence caused the breakage, they might be responsible. But the author might not be responsible for damages because the sitter didn't follow the agreed-upon care terms. Also, the sitter was underpaid by the original agreement. The author could argue that the sitter was at fault for mishandling the dog, leading to the accident. \n\nEthically, the author has valid concerns about the care given. They had a right to expect proper treatment, and the sitter's actions were negligent. The table was broken due to the sitter's method of restraint. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying for the table because the sitter's negligence caused the damage. Plus, the author was already overcompensating them with the extra $100 and the initial $300. \n\nAnother angle: The sitter's actions caused the problem. The author's dog was acting on instinct by trying to break free, which the sitter should have anticipated by tying it to a table. The sitter shouldn't have used a fragile object to tether the dog. Therefore, the responsibility lies with the sitter, not the author. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying for the table. The sitter's negligence led to the damage, and the author had already fulfilled their payment agreement. The answer should be B.\n"
