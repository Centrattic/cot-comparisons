We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. I need to figure out if it's AITA (Am I the Asshole) or not.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who is also his ex-piano teacher and the kids' current favorite. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the late wife's clothes in the master bedroom, which the author hasn't cleaned out. The author was upset, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress fitting, which he later realized came off as implying she was fat. The fianc\u00e9e was hurt and called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author's late wife's belongings are personal and may hold emotional significance. The author hadn't given permission for the fianc\u00e9e to use those items, so her trying them on without asking could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the author's reaction\u2014especially the comment about the dress stretching\u2014was harsh and likely hurtful. The word choice here is important because it's a sensitive topic, especially when dealing with a deceased spouse's belongings and body image.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how much the clothing represented to the author. Maybe she thought it was okay to use the space as they were moving in together. But respecting someone's emotional attachments to their late partner's possessions is crucial in a relationship. The author has the right to be upset if the clothes are a source of grief or a personal memorial.\n\nHowever, the way the author expressed his anger could have been more considerate. Instead of lashing out, he could have explained why it was important to him. His immediate reaction to criticize the fit of the dress, knowing the context of the late wife's size, was probably the bigger issue here. Even if he's justified in being upset about the clothes, the manner in which he conveyed it made things worse.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong in part because of the way he lashed out, even though his initial anger might have some basis in the situation. The fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped by trying the clothes without permission, but the author's hurtful comment was a poor reaction. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his response was inappropriate and contributed to the conflict.\n"
