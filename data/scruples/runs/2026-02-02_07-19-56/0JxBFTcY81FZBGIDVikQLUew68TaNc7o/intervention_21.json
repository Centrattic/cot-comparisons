We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a widower who's engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who was previously his daughter's piano teacher. They're getting married, and she's moving in. There's a walk-in closet with the author's late wife's clothes that he hasn't dealt with. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. The fianc\u00e9e tried on some of the late wife's clothes without permission, and the author got angry, even making a comment about her stretching the dress, which was hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's emotional sensitivity around his late wife's belongings, his communication of boundaries, and the fianc\u00e9e's actions. The author said he told her she could store her clothes if there was space, but maybe he didn't explicitly say not to touch the late wife's clothes. However, given the context of the author's grief and the personal nature of the items, the fianc\u00e9e should have been more cautious. She might not have realized how sensitive the issue was for him. But the author's reaction was also harsh, especially the comment about her size, which was inappropriate regardless of intent. The author's anger at her trying on the clothes could stem from respect for his late wife's memory and a need for privacy regarding those items. However, the way he expressed his anger, particularly the hurtful remark, does place some blame on him. The fianc\u00e9e might have crossed a line by entering the closet and trying on clothes without explicit permission, even if she thought there was space. But the author's response was also inconsiderate. So, both parties share some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's action was disrespectful, but the author's harsh reaction, including the hurtful comment, was also wrong. The main issue here is the author's comment about the dress being stretched, which was a personal attack. Even if he was upset, that's not an acceptable way to express his feelings. So maybe the author is partially at fault for his reaction, but the fianc\u00e9e also overstepped. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is in the wrong because he made a hurtful comment and didn't handle the situation calmly. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action was also inappropriate. The answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of his harsh response. But I need to choose A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. The author's main issue is being mad about the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes. Is that justified? If the author didn't want her to touch the clothes, he should have made that clear. He only told her she could store her clothes if there was space, which might not have covered not touching the late wife's items. So the fianc\u00e9e might have assumed it was okay. But the author's reaction was inappropriate. So the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong because he didn't clearly communicate boundaries and reacted harshly.\n"
