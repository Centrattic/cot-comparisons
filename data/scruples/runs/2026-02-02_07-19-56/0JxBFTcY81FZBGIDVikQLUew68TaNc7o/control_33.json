We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being angry with his fianc\u00e9e after she tried on his late wife's clothes. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. He has four kids and his fianc\u00e9e was his eldest daughter's piano teacher. They've been dating for a year and are engaged. Now she's moving in, and there's a shared walk-in closet with his late wife's clothes. He didn't clean it out yet, and told her she could store some clothes there if there's space.\n\nThen she tried on his wife's dress. He walked in, saw the clothes scattered, got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about her stretching the dress. She cried, he apologized but she's hurt. He's asking if he's in the wrong for being mad about her trying on the clothes without permission.\n\nHmm. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the closet is a personal space holding items of a deceased person, which can be a sensitive area. The author might feel that going through those clothes is a violation of his late wife's privacy or a personal boundary he didn't want crossed. The fianc\u00e9e was trying on clothes, which might have been intrusive. The author's reaction, while harsh, might stem from grief and the emotional weight of that space.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's action could be seen as a mistake. She might not have realized the emotional impact of trying on clothes that he hasn't dealt with yet. However, the author did mention she could store her clothes there if there was space, which might imply that the closet isn't entirely off-limits. Maybe she thought it was okay to use the space but didn't consider the sensitivity of the items. His comment about her stretching the dress was clearly hurtful, even if it was a slip. That's inexcusable and definitely his fault.\n\nThe key points are: Was her action wrong, and how reasonable is his anger? The author not having cleaned out the closet suggests he still holds emotional ties to his late wife. The fianc\u00e9e, in trying on the clothes, might have overstepped, especially without discussion. But the author's response was inappropriate. He lashed out with a hurtful comment, which is a problem regardless of her actions. However, the initial anger about the clothes might be a valid reaction given the personal nature of the items. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe partially. The comment was definitely his fault, but her action was also a mistake. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. If being mad is about her trying on the clothes, maybe not, but his reaction (the comment) is where he's wrong. The answer depends on whether the anger is justified but the response is not.\n\nIn many similar situations, people might find that the fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake, but the author's harsh words were uncalled for. The fianc\u00e9e might need to be more considerate of the emotional weight of those clothes, but the author should have handled it without insulting her. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong for being upset, but he did act inappropriately in his response. But according to the question, the focus is on the anger itself. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad. If the anger is about her trying on the clothes without permission, then maybe he's not in the wrong, but if his response was too harsh, then he is. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. If the initial anger is justified, then answer B (no). If her action was a mistake but his anger was excessive, then maybe A. But I think in this case, the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, so the author's anger is understandable, but his comment was wrong. However, the question isn't about the comment, it's about the anger. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) for being mad, but he's wrong for his comment. The question is specifically about being mad, not about the comment. So the answer could be B. Alternatively, maybe it's A if the fianc\u00e9e's action wasn't a boundary issue. But the closet was his late wife's, and he hadn't cleaned it out. The fianc\u00e9e moving in and trying on clothes there could be seen as invasive. Therefore, the author's anger might be justified, so B. But the answer depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In many cases, people might say that the author is not in the wrong because the clothes are personal and the fianc\u00e9e crossed a line. However, the way he handled it was bad. But the question is about being mad, not the handling. So answer B.\n"
