We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes of the author's deceased wife, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago, has four kids, and is now engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and she tried on clothes from the deceased wife's closet without permission. The author got angry, said something about her stretching the dress, which made her cry. He apologized but she felt hurt.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e was in the master bedroom, which has the author's late wife's belongings. The author told her she could store her clothes there if there was space, but didn't mention the rest of the items. So maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't realize that the clothes were off-limits. But the author might have the right to be upset because those are personal items, especially from his deceased wife. The act of trying them on without permission could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction included an insensitive comment about the dress fitting, which he later regretted. He used a phrase that could be misinterpreted as body-shaming, which definitely hurt his fianc\u00e9e. Even if his intent wasn't to insult, the way he expressed his anger was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that the author is still emotionally attached to his late wife, making it hard for her to integrate into the family.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and emotional sensitivity. Grief is a personal process, and some might say the author needs to handle his late wife's belongings with care, but the fianc\u00e9e's actions might have crossed a boundary. However, the author's response of lashing out and making a hurtful comment is problematic. Even if he had a valid reason to be upset, the way he handled it was wrong.\n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have tried on the clothes without permission, but the author's reaction was also hurtful. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author did make a derogatory comment that caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally, he's partially at fault. But maybe the primary issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his reaction was justified. Since he made a hurtful remark, he's at fault here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
