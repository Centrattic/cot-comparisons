We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a widower who's married to his fianc\u00e9e, who used to be his daughter's piano teacher. They have four kids from his previous marriage. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and there's a walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings. He didn't want to clean it out but allowed the fianc\u00e9e to store her clothes there. She ended up trying on the late wife's clothes, which upset him. He got angry, said something about her stretching the dress, which implied she's bigger than his late wife, and she got hurt.\n\nNow, to assess blame. The author's anger is understandable because the clothes belong to his deceased wife, which is a sensitive area. However, his reaction\u2014calling her fat (even if inadvertently) and lashing out\u2014might have been too harsh. He did apologize, but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which was probably a mistake. She might not have realized how sensitive that area is. But the author didn't make his boundaries clear. He allowed her to store her clothes there but didn't specify that trying on the late wife's clothes was off-limits. \n\nSo, both parties have some responsibility. The author's reaction was harsh, especially the comment about stretching the dress. That's a clear point where he crossed a line. The fianc\u00e9e should have respected the space and not tried on the clothes without permission. However, the author could have communicated his feelings about the closet and the clothes more clearly.\n\nIn terms of who is more at fault, the author's inappropriate comment and the way he lashed out might make him more at fault here. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, but the author's response was more hurtful. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
