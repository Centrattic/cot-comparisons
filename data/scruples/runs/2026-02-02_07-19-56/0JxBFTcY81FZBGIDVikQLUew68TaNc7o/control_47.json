We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago, and they have four kids. He's engaged to his girlfriend, who's now moving in. The fianc\u00e9e, who was previously the eldest daughter's piano teacher, is trying on clothes from the late wife's walk-in closet.\n\nThe author found her in the act, got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress stretching. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt, and the argument is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the key points here: Is it wrong for the fianc\u00e9e to try on the clothes? And is the author's reaction justified?\n\nClothes of a deceased person can be very personal and carry emotional weight. The author hasn't cleaned out the closet, so those items are likely still sacred or private to him. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask for permission, which might be a problem. She might not realize the emotional impact of her actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction included a hurtful comment about the dress stretching, which could be interpreted as implying she's fat. That's definitely inconsiderate, even if it wasn't his intent. He apologized, but the damage was done. \n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission that might be intrusive, but the author's response was harsh. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both have some responsibility. The author has the right to be upset about his late wife's belongings being handled without consent. However, his reaction was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked before trying on the clothes. \n\nThe main issue is the author's comment. Even if he was upset, saying something about the dress stretching is likely to be hurtful. So, he's partially in the wrong for his reaction, while the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not respecting boundaries. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did lash out and made a hurtful comment, even if his initial anger was about her violating a boundary, his actions contributed to the conflict. Therefore, he shares some blame, but maybe not entirely. However, the question is if he's in the wrong, which might lean towards \"No\" because his boundary was violated, but his reaction is also problematic. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So even though he has a valid grievance, his reaction was inappropriate. Therefore, he's in the wrong for the way he reacted, even if the situation was sensitive. So answer A (Yes) or B (No)?\n\nHmm. If the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad about the clothes, but not for his reaction. The question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad... for trying on my deceased wife's clothing?\" So the main issue is his anger at her trying on the clothes. \n\nIn that case, the author is not in the wrong for being upset about her trying on the clothes without permission. The clothes are personal, and she didn't respect his wishes. His anger is justified in that aspect. However, the way he reacted (hurtful comment) is where he's in the wrong. But the question is specifically about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. \n\nThe Reddit-style question is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for that action. So the answer would depend on whether trying on the late wife's clothes is a valid reason for anger. Since the author hasn't dealt with that closet, and it's his late wife's belongings, he's within his rights to be upset. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. His reaction was poor, but the initial anger is not wrong. Hence, answer B (No).\n"
