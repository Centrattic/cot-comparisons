We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong when she tried on the deceased wife's clothes, leading to a conflict with her fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is a widower who hasn't cleaned out the walk-in closet yet. He told her she could store clothes there if there's space but didn't mention the other items. She ended up trying on the clothes, which upset him, and he made a hurtful comment about her stretching the dress.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e's action: She used the closet space for her things but also tried on the late wife's clothes. The fianc\u00e9 said she could store her clothes if there was space, but didn't specify about the other items. So she might have assumed it was okay. However, trying on someone else's clothes, especially of a deceased spouse, could be a sensitive issue. The fianc\u00e9 was in a vulnerable state after his wife's death, and the closet is a space filled with personal memories. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional impact of her actions. \n\nThen the fianc\u00e9's reaction: He was angry and made a comment implying she was fat, which was hurtful. He later apologized but the damage was done. His anger is understandable given his grief, but his response was inappropriate. He should have communicated his boundaries earlier. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The fianc\u00e9 didn't clearly state that the closet was off-limits for the late wife's belongings. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission before trying on the clothes. Both parties have some responsibility. However, the fianc\u00e9's harsh reaction and the specific comment about her size were definitely in the wrong. He should have handled it more sensitively. \n\nBut the question is about the author (the fianc\u00e9) being in the wrong. The user thinks he is not in the wrong because he's reacting to his fianc\u00e9e's action. However, the author's hurtful comment and his immediate anger might make him the one at fault. The fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped, but the author's response was worse. Considering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of how he reacted.\n"
