We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a widower who's now engaged to his fianc\u00e9e. She tried on his deceased wife's clothes, which made him angry. He yelled at her, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author is still grieving his wife, which is a big deal. Two years is not that long, especially since he was in a bad place after her death. The closet with her clothes is a personal space, and he hasn't dealt with it yet. So, finding his fianc\u00e9e in there trying on the clothes could be really triggering and disrespectful to him. That makes sense emotionally.\n\nBut then, the fianc\u00e9e's actions. She was moving in and told she could store her clothes if there was space. She went into the closet, found the clothes, and tried them on without asking. Even if the space was shared, the clothes belong to the author's late wife. There's a line between what's acceptable and what's not. The fianc\u00e9e might not realize how sensitive this is. She might have thought it was okay to use the space, but the clothes are personal items. So, her action was a mistake because she didn't seek permission and didn't consider the emotional weight of those items.\n\nThen, the author's reaction. He was angry, said something hurtful about her body, then apologized. He admits he shouldn't have implied she was fat. That's a problem because his response was out of proportion and hurtful. However, his anger stems from the situation being disrespectful to his late wife. So, while his reaction was wrong, the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e was also wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset about his fianc\u00e9e handling his late wife's clothes without permission. The clothes are a deeply personal and emotional matter. He didn't clean them out yet, which is his decision. The fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying them on. So, he has a valid reason to be angry. However, his reaction was inappropriate. He should have handled it without lashing out, especially with a comment about her body. That's hurtful and could be seen as the author's fault.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was wrong for being angry. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her. Since her action was a mistake, maybe he's not in the wrong for being upset. But his reaction was wrong. The question is about the rightness of being mad, not the reaction. However, the way the question is phrased, \"AITA for being mad...\" So, is it okay to be mad, or is he in the wrong for being mad?\n\nIn the AITA format, the judgment often considers both parties. The fianc\u00e9e did something that was disrespectful, but the author's reaction was also inappropriate. However, the author's anger is somewhat justified given the context. But the way he expressed it was wrong. The problem is, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad, not necessarily his reaction. If the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. However, the author's response (calling her an asshole, hurting her feelings) complicates things.\n\nBut the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The author is in a sensitive situation. The clothes are personal, and she tried them on without permission. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being mad about that action. However, his reaction (the comment about her body) was wrong, but the question is about the initial anger. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake. However, the author's reaction is a separate issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. Since her action was wrong, the author's anger is justified, so he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
