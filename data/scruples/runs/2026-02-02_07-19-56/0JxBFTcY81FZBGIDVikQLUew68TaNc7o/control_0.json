We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. He has four kids, and his fianc\u00e9e was their piano teacher. They've been dating for a year and are engaged. The fianc\u00e9e moved in and tried on clothes from the ex-wife's closet. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress being stretched because his wife was a different size. He apologized but she was hurt.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and grief. The author hasn't cleaned out the closet yet, so those items are still personal and might be part of his grieving process. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the author's reaction included a hurtful comment about her size, which is definitely something he should have avoided.\n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive the issue is. She could have thought it was okay since the author said she could store her clothes there. But trying on clothes of a deceased person is a big deal, especially if the owner is still grieving. The author's anger might be justified because those items are personal and sacred to him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was inappropriate. Calling her an asshole and making a comment about her size, even if it wasn't meant that way, was mean. He should have expressed his feelings without attacking her. His right to be upset is there, but the way he handled it was wrong.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because of his harsh words, even though his initial anger might have had a basis. The fianc\u00e9e overstepped, but his response was not acceptable. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes) because the author is in the wrong for his reaction, even if the situation is complex.\n"
