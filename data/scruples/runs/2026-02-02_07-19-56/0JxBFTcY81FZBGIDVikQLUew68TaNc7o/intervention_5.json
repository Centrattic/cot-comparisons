We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a widower with four kids, and his fianc\u00e9e used to be their piano teacher. They've been dating for a year and are engaged. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and she tried on clothes from the author's late wife without permission. The author got angry, said something about the dress stretching because his ex-wife was a different size, and then apologized but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt.\n\nSo, the main points: The author was upset about the fianc\u00e9e using the late wife's clothes. He didn't clear it with her. He made a comment about her size, which he regretted. Then he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering emotions here. The author's late wife's belongings are personal and likely have emotional value. The fianc\u00e9e might have thought it was okay since she was moving in and the closet was available. But the author hadn't dealt with the loss yet, so his reaction is understandable. However, the way he reacted\u2014implying she was stretching the dress\u2014might have been harsh, even if he didn't mean to be insulting.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes without asking, which is disrespectful to the memory of the late wife and possibly a breach of trust. The author's anger is valid because those clothes are part of his grief and loss. However, his choice of words was hurtful, even if unintentional. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry about the situation or only for how he expressed it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key here is whether the action of trying on the clothes without permission is a bigger issue than the author's reaction. The author's main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action, not the size comment. The size comment was a mistake, but the initial anger might be justified. However, the fianc\u00e9e could have asked first. The author might have a right to be upset, but he could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. If the fianc\u00e9e did something that violated his wishes (trying on clothes without permission), then the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. But if the way he expressed it is the main issue, then maybe both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action (trying on clothes) is worse than the reaction. I think the author's main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action, so he's not in the wrong for being angry. But his words were inappropriate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action was the problem, but his reaction was flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong for being mad. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The size comment is a separate issue. So the answer is B.\n"
