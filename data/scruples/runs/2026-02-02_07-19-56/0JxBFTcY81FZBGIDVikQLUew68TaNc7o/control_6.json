We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e tried on their deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is a widower, still dealing with the loss two years ago. They have four kids and the fianc\u00e9e is someone who's been a support. The fianc\u00e9e was the piano teacher, so there's a history there. The author hasn't cleaned out the closet yet, which is a personal decision, but allowed the fianc\u00e9e to store her clothes there. \n\nThe key issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes without permission. The author found her doing this and got angry, even making a comment about the dress stretching because of her size. That comment clearly hurt her, even if it wasn't intentional. The author apologized but the damage was done.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the clothes are a personal connection to their late wife. The closet is a space of grief and memory. Having someone else, even a partner, interact with those items without consent might feel like a violation. The author's anger could stem from unresolved grief and the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive the situation was. She was in the process of moving in, so maybe she thought having access to the closet was part of her new domestic arrangements. However, going through and trying on a deceased person's belongings without asking is generally considered inconsiderate and intrusive. \n\nThe author's reaction was harsh, especially the remark about the dress stretching. Even if the intention was to express frustration, the wording was hurtful. The author should have addressed the situation calmly, explaining the emotional weight of the clothes rather than making a size-related comment. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions were disrespectful, but the author's response was also inappropriate. Both parties have some responsibility here. The author needed to communicate their boundaries clearly, perhaps earlier, and the fianc\u00e9e should have respected the sanctity of the items without permission. \n\nIn the end, while the author has valid reasons for being upset, the way they handled it by hurting the fianc\u00e9e's feelings makes them partially at fault. The fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not respecting the author's personal space. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was justified. Since the author did lash out in a hurtful way, they share some blame here.\n"
