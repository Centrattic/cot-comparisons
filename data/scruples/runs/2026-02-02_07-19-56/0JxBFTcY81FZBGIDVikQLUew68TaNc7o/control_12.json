We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a widower, is engaged to his girlfriend. His deceased wife's clothes are still in the closet, and he hadn't cleaned them out. He told his fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space. Then she tried on his late wife's dress, and he got angry, even if he later apologized for saying she was stretching the dress.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission. The author had told her she could store her clothes if there was space, but did he give her permission to try on the clothes? The key here is whether trying on the clothes without asking was a breach of trust or boundaries. Since the clothes belong to his deceased wife, they might be a sensitive area. The author might feel that the clothes are part of his late wife's personal effects and shouldn't be disturbed, especially without his consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might have been harsh. He said something that implied she was fat, which could be seen as hurtful, even if it wasn't his intention. His fianc\u00e9e was trying on the clothes, maybe out of curiosity or to see if they fit, but the action itself could be considered disrespectful to the deceased wife. The author's anger might be justified because the clothes are in a private space connected to his late wife, and the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by using them without permission.\n\nBut then, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive this issue was. The author might need to communicate his boundaries more clearly, but the act of trying on the clothes without asking is still a problem. So the author isn't entirely wrong, but his reaction could be seen as too harsh. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The author had a right to be upset about her going through and trying on the clothes, which he might consider sacred or a personal space. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong, but he should have handled it more carefully. The answer is B (No).\n"
