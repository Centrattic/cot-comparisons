We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The closet with her belongings is a sensitive space. The fianc\u00e9e, who's also the kids' piano teacher and now moving in, might not fully grasp the emotional weight of going through those clothes. \n\nThe author said he never wanted to clean it out and told her she could store her clothes there if space allowed. But he didn't explicitly say she couldn't touch the other items. So, maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't realize it was off-limits. \n\nThe author's reaction: he got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress. The comment about her stretching the dress implied she was fat, even if it wasn't his intention. That's a big no-no and definitely hurtful. He apologized, but the damage was done. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission. On the other, his reaction was harsh and included a hurtful comment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He did have a right to be upset about her invading that personal space. But the way he expressed his anger, especially the comment about her size, is definitely his fault. The key here is that the hurtful comment was a direct result of his anger, which escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked before trying on the clothes, but the author's response was inappropriate. However, the original question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he acted in a hurtful way, even if he was upset, he's partially at fault. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad about her trying on the clothes. If the answer is about the justification of his anger, then maybe not. But the way he handled it, especially the comment, makes him at least partially responsible. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because his reaction was inappropriate and he crossed the line with the comment, even if his initial anger was justified. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were wrong, but his response made him at fault too.\n"
