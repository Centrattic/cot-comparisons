We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, there's the emotional aspect. The author lost his wife two years ago, which is a sensitive period. The fianc\u00e9e is new, and there's a lot going on with four kids. The closet has his late wife's personal items, which he hasn't dealt with yet. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes without permission, which makes him upset.\n\nHe told her not to touch the clothes, but she did anyway. He got angry and made a comment about the dress size, which he later regretted. Even though he apologized, she felt hurt. The key points here are boundaries and communication. \n\nHe had explicitly told her she could store her clothes in the closet if there was space, but he didn't mention the personal items. So maybe he should have been clearer about which items were off-limits. However, the fianc\u00e9e crossed a line by going through and trying on clothes that were private. \n\nThe author's reaction included a hurtful comment, which was inappropriate. Even though his intention was to express his hurt, saying something about her size was a misstep. But the initial anger stems from her violating a personal boundary. \n\nSo is he in the wrong? The fianc\u00e9e violated a boundary, but the author's response was harsh. Both have some responsibility here. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The author's reaction was emotional, but the root cause is her overstepping. Still, he could have communicated better about the closet's contents before she moved in. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is partially wrong for lashing out, but the fianc\u00e9e is wrong for entering his late wife's belongings without permission. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he apologized and the main issue was her action, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But his harsh words contributed to the conflict. \n\nHmm. The answer might lean towards A (author is wrong) because he did say something hurtful. But if the focus is on her action, maybe B (not wrong). However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The comment about the dress size was the immediate issue. Even if he was upset, that specific remark was a mistake. So perhaps the answer is A because his response was inappropriate, even if the initial anger is understandable.\n"
