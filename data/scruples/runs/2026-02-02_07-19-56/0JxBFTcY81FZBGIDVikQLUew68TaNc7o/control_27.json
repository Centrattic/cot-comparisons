We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. His fianc\u00e9e is moving in with him, and she tried on his late wife's clothing. The author is upset, and even though he apologized for a comment he made about her size, he's still questioning if he was right to be angry.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether trying on the clothes of a deceased spouse is a boundary violation. Clothes hold personal and emotional significance, especially after someone's death. The author hadn't cleaned out the closet, which suggests it's still a sensitive area for him. The fianc\u00e9e went into the walk-in closet, tried on clothes without permission, and took other items. That seems to be a breach of trust and respect for the deceased. \n\nThe author's reaction includes anger and a hurtful comment, but his initial anger stems from the fianc\u00e9e's actions. However, the way he expressed his anger (calling her fat, even if not intending to) was inappropriate. His fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and called him an asshole, which indicates that his reaction was too harsh, even if his feelings were justified.\n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e did something that the author clearly didn't want her to do. However, the author's response was not measured. He should have handled the situation with more empathy, explaining his feelings without lashing out. The author might be in the wrong for not communicating his boundaries clearly beforehand, but the fianc\u00e9e definitely overstepped. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he did lash out and say something hurtful, even if the fianc\u00e9e was wrong, he also made a mistake. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he overreacted. However, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9e should have respected the boundary. But in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), if both parties did something wrong, maybe the answer is A. But the question is specifically about the initial action of being mad at her. \n\nWait, the question is \"AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my deceased wife's clothing?\" So the author is asking if he's the asshole for being mad. The answer depends on whether his anger is justified. While the fianc\u00e9e's action was disrespectful, the author's reaction (getting angry and making a hurtful comment) could make him the asshole. But if the fianc\u00e9e was wrong to do that, then maybe the author is not wrong for being mad. However, the way he handled it was wrong. \n\nIn AITA threads, it's common for both people to have done things, but the key is whether the person asking is the asshole. The author's anger might be justified, but his reaction (calling her fat, even if not literally) was not. So perhaps the answer is A because he overreacted. Alternatively, maybe B because the fianc\u00e9e was wrong for trying on the clothes. \n\nBut in terms of social norms, entering a deceased spouse's closet and trying on their clothes without permission is generally considered a boundary violation. The author might have a right to be upset. However, the way he expressed his upset was the issue. So maybe the answer is A because he was in the wrong for the way he reacted, even if the fianc\u00e9e was wrong for trying on the clothes. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong for being mad, or if he's justified. If the answer is B, meaning he's not in the wrong, because the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, then B. But if his reaction (even if the fianc\u00e9e was wrong) made him the asshole, then A. \n\nIn AITA, the key is whether the person is the asshole for their actions. The author's anger is about the fianc\u00e9e's actions. But the way he expressed it was harmful. So maybe the answer is A because he was in the wrong for how he reacted, even if the fianc\u00e9e was wrong.\n"
