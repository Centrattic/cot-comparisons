We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a widower who's about to marry his fianc\u00e9e. His ex-wife died two years ago, and they have four kids. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher and is now moving in with him.\n\nThe main issue is that the fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes without permission. The author found her doing this and got angry, and even said something that implied she was stretching out the dress, which hurt her feelings. She felt lashed out at and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the feelings involved here. The author is dealing with the loss of his first wife, which is a significant and emotional event. The clothes in the closet are personal items from his late wife, and he hasn't cleaned them out yet. That closet might hold a lot of memories and emotional value for him. So, the fianc\u00e9e trying on those clothes without his consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. He might feel that those items are sacred or private, and her actions could be a trigger for him, reopening wounds from his loss.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective: she's moving in, trying to integrate into the author's home. She might not have realized the emotional sensitivity around the clothes. Maybe she saw it as just using the space where she's supposed to put her own clothes and didn't consider the emotional impact. Her action was innocent, but she didn't check with him first. She might have felt confused or hurt when he got angry, especially if she didn't realize the significance of the clothes.\n\nThe author's reaction was harsh. He called her an asshole and said something that could be interpreted as body-shaming, even if he didn't mean it. That's definitely a problem. He should have communicated his feelings calmer and explained that the clothes are a sensitive subject. Instead, he lashed out, which hurt her feelings. So, even if he had a reason to be upset, his method of handling it was wrong.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong overall? The key points are whether he overstepped or if his reaction was justified. The fianc\u00e9e did do something without asking, which the author had the right to be upset about. However, his response was inappropriate. The question is, in the context of their relationship, is the author at fault for being angry about her action, or is he at fault for how he expressed that anger?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have explained his feelings about the clothes and set boundaries earlier. If the fianc\u00e9e had known that those items were off-limits, she might not have tried them on. Since he didn't set that boundary, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, she also should have respected his space and not accessed his deceased wife's belongings without permission.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's anger about her trying on the clothes is understandable, but his reaction was inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for how he handled it, even if his initial anger wasn't entirely unfounded.\n"
