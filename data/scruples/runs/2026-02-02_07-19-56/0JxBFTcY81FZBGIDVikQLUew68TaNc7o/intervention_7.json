We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago, and the fianc\u00e9e used to be their piano teacher. Now she's moving in, and she tried on the clothes from the walk-in closet that the author hadn't cleaned out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hasn't dealt with the loss yet. The closet is filled with personal items of his late wife. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could use the space, but she went into the closet and tried on the clothes. The author got angry and made a comment about the dress being stretched, which he later realized was insensitive because his wife was a different size. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and accused him of lashing out.\n\nNow, the key points here are boundaries and grief. The author's late wife's belongings are probably a sensitive area. By not cleaning out the closet, he might have left it as a personal space for memory. The fianc\u00e9e, not knowing the extent of his sensitivity, might have crossed a line by trying on the clothes without permission. However, the author's reaction\u2014insensitive comment and anger\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially since he had allowed her to use the space for her own clothes.\n\nBut then, the author is grieving, and his reaction might stem from that. However, he should have communicated his boundaries clearly. If he didn't want the fianc\u00e9e to go through his late wife's things, he should have made that known. The fianc\u00e9e might not have understood the emotional weight of the situation. On the other hand, the author's comment about the dress being stretched was a direct personal attack, which escalated the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, both sides have some responsibility. The author didn't set clear boundaries, but the fianc\u00e9e did go into a private space and tried on clothes without permission. However, the author's reaction was inappropriate, especially the comment about her size. The immediate regret and apology show he realizes that part was wrong, but his initial anger over the clothes might be justified if he didn't want them touched. \n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach of trust or boundary, and the author's reaction was also a breach but in a different way. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did lash out and make an insensitive comment, he's partially at fault. But his feelings about his late wife's belongings are valid. So the answer might be a mix, but the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he was angry for a reason but reacted poorly, maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he shouldn't have made that comment and didn't communicate his boundaries properly.\n"
