We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author lost his first wife two years ago and is now engaged to someone who was his daughter's piano teacher. They're moving in together, and his fianc\u00e9e tried on his late wife's clothes without permission. The author was upset, said something about her stretching the dress, which he later regretted. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is hurt, and they're both upset.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, respect, and communication. The author hasn't cleaned out the walk-in closet, which contains his late wife's belongings. He mentioned he never wanted to but allowed the fianc\u00e9e to store her clothes there if space allowed. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without asking, which the author found upsetting. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did lash out with a comment that implied his fianc\u00e9e's body size was an issue, which was hurtful. That's a clear mistake. However, the initial anger might stem from his grief and the personal nature of the clothes. But the fianc\u00e9e did cross a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission. She might not have realized the emotional weight of those items.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger is understandable, but his reaction was inappropriate. He didn't handle the situation well by making a comment about body size, which is a sensitive issue. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action of trying on the clothes without asking is also a boundary issue. So maybe both are at fault to some extent. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he admitted he was wrong about the comment and is now seeking validation, but the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. \n\nWait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is wrong but wants my take. The options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nThe author's main issue is his reaction. He was upset about the clothes being tried on, which is a valid feeling because those clothes are tied to his late wife. However, his response included a hurtful comment. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary violation, but the author's response was also a problem. \n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong because of his hurtful comment, but maybe not entirely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. If the fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary, then the author's anger is justified, but his method of handling it wasn't. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is in the wrong for their response even if they have a valid reason. Here, the author's anger is understandable, but his reaction was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, but the author's handling of it (the comment) was also wrong. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because his reaction was wrong. If B, then he's not in the wrong for being angry about the action itself. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's anger is about the fianc\u00e9e's action (trying on clothes without permission), which is a valid issue. However, his reaction (insulting her body) was the wrong part. So, the author is in the wrong for his reaction, but not necessarily for being upset about the action itself. The question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on...\" So if the author is in the wrong for being mad, that would mean his anger is unjustified. But if the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary violation, then his anger is justified. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the author's anger is justified. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes without permission, which the author had not asked her to do. So he's in the right to be upset about that. However, his way of reacting was wrong. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being mad, not for his reaction. \n\nThis is tricky. The AITA question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. If the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, then the author is not in the wrong for being angry. But if the action wasn't a big deal, then he might be. \n\nIn this case, the clothes belong to his late wife. Trying them on without permission is a boundary violation. So the author's anger is justified. However, his comment was inappropriate. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad. Since the action was a boundary issue, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The problem is his reaction, but the anger itself is not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
