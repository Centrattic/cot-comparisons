We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9e for trying on clothes from his deceased wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lost his wife two years ago, and the fianc\u00e9e is moving in. The walk-in closet has the late wife's clothes, which the author hasn't dealt with. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space. She tried on some of the clothes without asking, and he got angry, said something about the dress being stretched out, which came across as implying she was fat. He apologized but she was hurt.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and respect. The clothes belong to the deceased, which can be a sensitive issue. The author might still be grieving, and others might not realize the emotional weight. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author allowed her to store clothes in the closet, trying on some was okay. But she didn't ask, which is a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's reaction was harsh, especially the comment about the dress. That's clearly hurtful and not appropriate. However, the initial anger might stem from the emotional trauma of losing his wife and the intrusion into a personal space. But he did apologize, which shows he recognized the mistake.\n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission, which is a problem. However, the author didn't clearly communicate that the clothes were off-limits. Maybe he should have been more explicit. But since the fianc\u00e9e went ahead without asking, that's on her. The author's outburst was inappropriate, but perhaps the root issue is the unspoken boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is tricky. The author is partially in the wrong for his harsh comment, but the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not respecting boundaries. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because his reaction was inappropriate, but B (No) because he had a right to be upset. But given that he apologized and the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask, maybe it's a mix. However, according to the options, it's either A or B. The harsh comment was definitely wrong, so he's in the wrong. But maybe the situation is more nuanced. Hmm.\n"
