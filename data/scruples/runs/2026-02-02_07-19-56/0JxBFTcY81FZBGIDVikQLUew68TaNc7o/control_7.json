We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is a widower, recently engaged, and his fianc\u00e9e used to be his kids' piano teacher. She's moving in, and there's a walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. But she ended up trying on clothes from the late wife. \n\nThe author was upset and said something about her stretching the dress, which was harsh because his late wife was a different size. That part definitely came off as body-shaming, even if unintended. He immediately regretted it and apologized, but she was hurt.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, the clothes belong to his late wife, so her trying them on without permission could be seen as intrusive. The closet is a private space with personal items, and he hadn't wanted to clean it out. So maybe her actions crossed a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was inappropriate. Saying \"you're stretching the dress\" was hurtful and not helpful in resolving the issue. Even if he was upset, that comment was mean-spirited. He did apologize, but the initial reaction was wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the context of his grief and the sensitivity of the situation, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how important those clothes were to him. But he should have communicated his feelings better. Maybe he could have explained that the closet is a sacred space and not for others to use. However, his response was to lashed out, which is why he's partially at fault.\n\nSo combining both aspects: she was wrong to try on the clothes without permission, but he was wrong in his response. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did lash out unkindly, even if the situation was sensitive, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he is in the wrong) because of his inappropriate reaction. However, if the focus is on her actions, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the main issue here is his reaction, which is where the problem escalated. So he's at least partially at fault. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he did say a hurtful comment, the answer is A.\n"
