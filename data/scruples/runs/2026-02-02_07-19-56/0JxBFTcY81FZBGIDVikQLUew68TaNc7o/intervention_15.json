We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again and break it down. \n\nThe author is a widower, married for 11 years, then his wife died two years ago in a car accident. He has four kids, which he's been raising alone since her death. His current fianc\u00e9e was previously his oldest daughter's piano teacher, and they've been dating for a year. Now, they're getting married, and she's moving into the master bedroom where the walk-in closet has his deceased wife's clothes. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. Then she tried on some of the clothes, and he got mad, called her an asshole, and said something about her stretching out the dress, which he later apologized for but it hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the fianc\u00e9e was wrong for trying on the clothes without permission. The author was clearly upset by her actions. But then he reacted in a way that came out as hurtful. He admitted he was in the wrong when he made the comment about her size, which is a problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her in the first place for trying on the clothes.\n\nThe closet has his late wife's clothes, and he hasn't cleaned it out. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. So maybe she thought it was okay to use the space. But trying on clothes that belong to a deceased person might be a sensitive issue. It's possible that the author sees those clothes as personal and sacred, and her actions were a breach of that. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional impact of her actions. There's a communication problem here. The author didn't clearly communicate that he didn't want her to touch the clothes. He just said she could store her clothes if there was space, which might not cover trying them on. \n\nThe author's reaction, though, was harsh. He lashed out, called her names, and made a hurtful comment. Even if he was upset, his response was inappropriate. So maybe the main issue is his reaction rather than her action. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad about her trying on the clothes. If he didn't give permission for that, then maybe he's justified in being upset. But if he didn't communicate his boundaries clearly, maybe he's partially at fault. \n\nAlso, the fact that the clothes are of his deceased wife adds a layer of emotional sensitivity. It's possible that the fianc\u00e9e didn't consider how that might affect him. But again, if the author didn't make it clear that the clothes weren't to be used, then part of the problem is on him for not setting boundaries. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the fianc\u00e9e's action might have been insensitive, but the author's reaction was definitely inconsiderate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial anger might be understandable, but the way he handled it is problematic. However, the core of the question is whether he's wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. If he didn't give permission, then maybe he's not in the wrong for being upset. But if he didn't communicate the boundaries, maybe he is partially at fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying on the clothes without asking, and if the author's anger is a reasonable response given the emotional context. However, his verbal lashing out is definitely not okay, but the question is about the initial anger. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because maybe he didn't clearly communicate that the clothes were off-limits, and his reaction was excessive. But if he had a right to be upset, then maybe not. It's a tough call. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
