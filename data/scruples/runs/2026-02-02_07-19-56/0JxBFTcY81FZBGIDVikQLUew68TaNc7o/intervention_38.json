We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the context: He's a widower who lost his wife two years ago, has four kids, and his fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's teacher. They've been dating a year and are engaged. The fianc\u00e9e moved in and tried on clothes from the walk-in closet which still has the late wife's belongings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a confirmation. I need to analyze both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author is grieving. The clothes are personal items from his late wife, and the fianc\u00e9e did this without asking. It's a sensitive area, and the author's reaction, while maybe harsh, might stem from emotional pain. The fact that he had not cleaned out the closet yet suggests it's not an easy topic for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive this is. She was trying to integrate into the house, maybe feeling entitled to use the space since she's moving in. However, accessing a deceased wife's personal items without permission could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThe author's comment about the dress was definitely inappropriate. He said \"you're stretching out the dress,\" which implied body-shaming, which is hurtful. Even if he didn't mean to, the words caused pain. \n\nBut the core issue is whether trying on the clothes without permission was wrong. The author didn't give explicit permission, so the fianc\u00e9e overstepped. However, the author's reaction was also harsh. So, maybe both have some responsibility.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The main act of the fianc\u00e9e was the problem. The author's anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it was wrong. However, the initial action by the fianc\u00e9e was the root cause. \n\nSo, considering the sensitivity of the situation and the boundaries of personal items, the fianc\u00e9e was wrong to try on the clothes without permission. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about it, even if his response was flawed. The key is whether the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, which she did. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's action was the problem. But the user thinks the author is wrong, which might be because they focus on the harsh words. But the main question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. The author's anger is justified, though his response was not. However, the core issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. So the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes, though his reaction could have been better.\n"
