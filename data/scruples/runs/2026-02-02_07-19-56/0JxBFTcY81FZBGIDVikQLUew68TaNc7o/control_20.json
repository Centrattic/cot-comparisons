We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. His fianc\u00e9e, who is also his kids' piano teacher, is moving in. The closet with the deceased wife's clothes is still there. He told her she could store her clothes there if there's space. She tried on the clothes without asking, and he got angry, even if he later apologized for a hurtful comment.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's anger is about his fianc\u00e9e handling his late wife's belongings without permission. That's a sensitive area. Grief and personal items can be really touchy. The fianc\u00e9e might have thought it was okay since he mentioned she could store her clothes there, but maybe she didn't realize the emotional weight of the clothes. On the other hand, the author did mention the closet had his wife's items, so maybe he should have been more explicit about boundaries. But the fianc\u00e9e did go ahead without asking, which could be seen as crossing a line. However, the author's reaction included an unkind remark about her size, which he regretted. Even though he apologized, that comment definitely hurt her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which he might be justified in being upset about. But his reaction could have been better. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong overall. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach without asking, but the author's response was harsh and included a personal jab. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed it was hurtful. So maybe he's partially at fault for the way he reacted, but the initial anger might be understandable. But the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. If the author didn't clean out the closet, maybe he should have communicated better about what's acceptable. But he did say she could store her clothes if there's space. The problem is that the clothes are of the deceased, so there's an emotional aspect. Maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't consider that, but the author could have set clearer boundaries. However, the immediate reaction of anger and a hurtful comment might make him at least partially wrong. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the author's anger was justified despite his manner of expression. If the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary violation, then his anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it was wrong. So, the answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong (B), but he did make a mistake in his response. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. The initial anger might be seen as okay if the action was inappropriate, but the way he handled it is where he's wrong. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong for being angry about the action, but his reaction was wrong. But the options are A (yes he is wrong) or B (no). So if the main issue is the action, then the answer is B. However, if the main issue is his reaction, then A. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission, maybe the anger is justifiable, making A not the case. But his reaction was poor. But the question is if he's in the wrong for being angry. The answer is likely B (no), because the action of trying on the clothes was a breach, but his response was inappropriate. However, the question is about being in the wrong for being mad. So technically, he's not wrong for being angry about the action, but his response was wrong. Since the options don't split between the reaction and the anger, but the answer is whether he's in the wrong overall. The answer is probably B (no), but there's nuance. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate boundaries clearly. But the fianc\u00e9e took initiative without asking. Hmm. I think the main point is that the author isn't entirely wrong for being upset about the action, but his response was hurtful. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, the answer is B (no), as the fianc\u00e9e's action was the issue. However, the way he handled it was wrong. But the options are about AITA. The answer would typically be B (he's not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's action was the problem, even if his response was flawed. So I'll go with B.\n"
