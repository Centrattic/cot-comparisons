We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9e trying on the author's deceased wife's clothes without permission, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is a widower, and the clothes are in the master bedroom's walk-in closet. He hasn't cleaned them out yet, and he told his fianc\u00e9e she could use the space if there was room. She tried on the clothes, which he found upsetting. He got angry, called her an asshole, and made a comment about the dress that could be taken as implying she's fat, even though he later apologized.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e was hurt and felt lashed out at. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes, despite the harsh words.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The author hasn't addressed the emotional impact of the clothes being in the closet. 2) He gave permission for her to use the space, but didn't expect her to interact with his late wife's items. 3) His reaction included a hurtful comment that might have been unnecessary, even if he apologized. 4) The fianc\u00e9e felt disrespected, which is a valid feeling.\n\nI need to consider if the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying on the clothes without permission. The author did say she could store clothes in the closet, but maybe not handle the personal items. However, he didn't explicitly say not to touch the deceased wife's belongings. So maybe his communication was unclear. On the other hand, trying on someone's deceased spouse's clothes might be a sensitive issue, as it could be seen as disrespectful or intrusive, especially when the spouse is still grieving.\n\nThe author's anger might be justified due to the emotional sensitivity, but his method of expressing it (calling her names, implying she's fat) was inconsiderate and hurtful. Even if the action (trying on clothes) was wrong, the way he reacted could have been handled better. He did apologize, but that doesn't erase the hurt caused.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong: the fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped by not respecting the author's personal space and items, especially without clear permission. However, the author's reaction was also inappropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The answer depends on whether his anger is justified. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something that could be seen as disrespectful, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But his harsh response might make him more at fault. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9e had a right to use the space and the author didn't communicate boundaries clearly, then the fianc\u00e9e might be at fault. However, the act of trying on the clothes itself could be considered a boundary issue, regardless of the author's communication.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) discussions, the focus is on whether the person's actions or reactions are reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's action might be seen as a boundary violation, but the author's response was also a problem. However, the question specifically is about the author being angry at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. The initial anger might be understandable, but the way he expressed it was wrong. So the author is partially in the wrong for the way he reacted, but maybe not entirely. However, since the question is whether he is in the wrong for being mad, the answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong because his anger stems from a sensitive issue, but his reaction was inappropriate. However, the standard answer in these scenarios often leans towards the person who hurt others being the AITA, even if they have valid reasons. So, considering the harsh words and the fact that the action was a boundary issue, perhaps the author is in the wrong for lashing out, even if the fianc\u00e9e's action was also wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is that he's not. It's a bit of a nuance. The fianc\u00e9e's action was inappropriate, so his anger is somewhat justified, but his response was not. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the action was wrong, but he's not entirely in the right. However, in AITA terms, if the person's reaction is disproportionate, they might be the AITA. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad, not for the words. So if the action was wrong, then he's not in the wrong for being angry. The problem is his words, but the question is about being mad, not about the words. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action was a boundary violation, so his anger is understandable. However, the user might think he's in the wrong because he overreacted. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the fianc\u00e9e had a right to use the closet as per the author's permission, then trying on the clothes might not be her fault. But the author's dead wife's clothes are personal items. So maybe the author should have made it clear that those items are off-limits, even if the space is for storage. In that case, the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, and the author's anger is justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But the way he reacted was bad, but the anger itself might be justified. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something that could be seen as disrespectful, the author is not in the wrong for being angry. The harsh words are a separate issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
