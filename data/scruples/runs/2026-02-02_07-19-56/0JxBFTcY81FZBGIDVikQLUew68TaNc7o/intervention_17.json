We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. The situation is pretty sensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a widower, and his wife's clothes are still in the closet. He hasn't cleaned them out, which might indicate that the items hold emotional value. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which upset him. But he also said something hurtful about the dress being \"stretched out,\" which could be interpreted as implying she's not the right size, even if that wasn't his intent.\n\nThe author's right to be upset could be justified because the clothes belong to a deceased loved one, and their use might be a personal boundary. However, his reaction included a comment that could be taken as body-shaming, which is unkind. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt, and the author immediately regretted his words. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e accessed the closet, which the author had not yet cleared out. He had allowed her to store clothes there if there was space, but didn't specify that the deceased wife's items were off-limits. So maybe he didn't communicate his boundaries clearly. \n\nBut the key issue is the comment about the dress. Even if it was a slip, it was a hurtful thing to say. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight of those clothes, but the author's response was harsh. \n\nSo, who is at fault? The author might be partially at fault for not clearly setting boundaries and for his hurtful comment. The fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not respecting the possibly sensitive nature of the items. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it, especially the comment about the dress, was inappropriate. Therefore, he shares some responsibility. The answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the comment he made was harmful and he didn't handle the situation calmly, perhaps he is in the wrong to some extent.\n\nBut the options are A (yes, author is in the wrong) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were a breach of boundary, but the author's reaction was also inappropriate. However, the question is specifically about the author's anger. The main issue is that the author was mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. Whether that's justified.\n\nThe author's right to be upset is valid, but the way he responded made it more problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. If he was angry but handled it poorly, does that mean he's in the wrong? Or is his anger justified, making him not in the wrong?\n\nIn some perspectives, being upset is okay, but the way he handled it was wrong. The question is about being in the wrong for being mad, not for the harsh comment. So if the author is in the wrong for being mad, then A. If his anger is justified but his response was wrong, then maybe he's not in the wrong for being mad.\n\nThis is tricky. The AITA forums often consider emotions and boundaries. The author's boundaries were not clear, but he did own the clothes. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission. So the author's anger might be justified. However, the hurtful comment is a red flag.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the anger itself is wrong. If the author's anger is a valid emotional response to someone disrespecting the memory of his deceased wife, then he's not in the wrong. But if his anger was excessive or unjustified, then he is. Since the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask, it's his right to be upset. But his response was poor. So the main question is about the anger itself, not the response. \n\nTherefore, the answer could be B (no, he's not in the wrong) because his anger is a valid reaction to a boundary being crossed, even if his handling of it was poor. The AITA question is about the action (being mad) not the response. So the author isn't in the wrong for being mad, but he's in the wrong for the comment. The options are about whether he's in the wrong for being mad. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
