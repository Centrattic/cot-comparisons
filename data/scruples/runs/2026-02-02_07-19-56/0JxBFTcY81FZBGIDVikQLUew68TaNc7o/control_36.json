We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who married his first wife at 23, and she passed away two years ago. They have four kids. The fianc\u00e9e, who is 24, used to be the oldest daughter's piano teacher. They've been dating for a year and are engaged. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is moving in. There's a walk-in closet with the author's late wife's clothes that he hasn't cleaned out yet. He told her she could store some clothes there if there was space.\n\nThe issue arose when the fianc\u00e9e tried on a dress and other items from the late wife. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about her stretching the dress. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt, thought he was an asshole, and they had a fight. The author is now questioning if he's in the wrong for being mad at her, but acknowledges that his comment about her size was inappropriate.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about boundaries and respect for the deceased. The author hasn't cleaned out the closet, which is personal and possibly sacred space for him. The fianc\u00e9e went into the master bedroom, which is part of their home, and started using items from the late wife without permission. The author might feel that those clothes are private, and the act of trying them on could be seen as disrespectful. However, his reaction\u2014especially the comment about her size\u2014was hurtful and uncalled for.\n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not realize the emotional weight of those clothes. On the other, she was in a space where she was given permission to place her clothes, but perhaps not to use the deceased's belongings. The author's reaction might be justified in terms of protecting his late wife's personal items, but his method of expressing that was poor.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is important too. She might have felt she was just using the space as allowed and didn't intend to disrespect. However, the author's grief and boundaries need to be respected. It's a conflict between the fianc\u00e9e's actions and the author's emotional state.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong for being upset, but his handling of the situation was flawed. The key is that he did express his anger in a hurtful way, but the initial reaction (being upset) might be understandable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he didn't give permission for her to use the clothes, and she went ahead without asking, might mean the author has a right to be upset. However, his response was inappropriate. So the answer might depend on whether the question is about the anger itself or the response. The Reddit-style answer often leans towards the person being in the wrong if their reaction is harsh, even if they have a point. But here, the author's anger is at the action, not the response. Wait, the question is: AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my deceased wife's clothing? The answer is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. If the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission that he finds disrespectful, then no, he's not in the wrong for being angry. However, the way he expressed it was wrong. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) for being angry, but he's in the wrong for his harsh response. But the question is specifically about being mad at the action. So the answer is B. But maybe the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, so he's justified in being angry. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
