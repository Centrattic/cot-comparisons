We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his late wife's clothes. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a widower with four kids. His ex-piano teacher became his fianc\u00e9e. They're engaged and moving in. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from the author's late wife's walk-in closet. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress stretching because his wife was tall and a size 0. The fianc\u00e9e was hurt and cried, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is who's at fault. The author's perspective: he's still grieving. His late wife's clothes are in a closet, and he hasn't cleared it out. He gave permission for the fianc\u00e9e to store her clothes there if there's space, but he didn't mention the personal items. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without asking. That's a problem because those items are personal and part of his grief process. The author's anger is about her invading that space without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight. She might have thought the clothes were just taking up space. But he had not cleared it out, implying he still wanted to keep them private. She should have asked before going through them. However, the author's response, calling her fat, was a mistake. Even if he didn't mean to imply that, the words hurt. He apologized, but the damage was done.\n\nThe key points: the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by using the late wife's belongings without permission, which is a personal and sensitive matter. The author's anger is understandable due to grief. However, his choice of words was inappropriate and added to the hurt. So, the author is partially in the wrong for his harsh reaction, but the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not respecting the boundaries. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is. \n\nThe answer depends on whose actions are more wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's action is a breach of privacy, but the author's response was laced with a hurtful comment. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering his reaction and the context, maybe the answer is A. But some might argue he's not entirely wrong. Hmm. But the fianc\u00e9e did the initial wrong, but the author's response was also wrong. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer might be A or B. Need to decide.\n"
