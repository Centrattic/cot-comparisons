We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who recently got engaged. His fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's piano teacher and is moving in. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet with his late wife's clothes. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. She tried on some of the late wife's clothes without permission, and he got angry, even making a comment about the dress being stretched, which he later regretted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the deceased's clothing without consent. The author is upset about that. But then he said something about the dress being stretched, which came off as implying she's fat. He apologized but the fianc\u00e9e was hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the author is grieving and the closet is a personal, sensitive space. The clothes of a deceased spouse can be very emotional. It's understandable that he's upset she went through them without permission. On the other hand, his reaction might have been harsh, especially the comment about the dress. Even if he didn't mean to imply she's fat, the wording could have been hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e felt lashed out at, so his communication might have been part of the problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial anger is about her using the clothes without asking. That's his personal item, so he has a right to be upset. But the way he reacted\u2014making a sarcastic or hurtful comment\u2014probably contributed to the conflict. So maybe he's not entirely wrong for being angry, but his handling of the situation could be better. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The key points are: did she overstep by trying on the clothes, and was his reaction appropriate?\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because the fianc\u00e9e did go through personal items without permission. However, his comment about the dress was definitely hurtful and unkind, which complicates things. The answer might be a mix, but the options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is her action vs. his reaction.\n\nIn similar situations, people often say that the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, but the author's harsh reaction also makes him share the blame. However, the initial act of trying on clothes without permission is a boundary issue. The answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong for being mad, but he should have handled it better. So answer B (No). But maybe some would say he's in the wrong for not setting boundaries earlier. Hmm.\n"
