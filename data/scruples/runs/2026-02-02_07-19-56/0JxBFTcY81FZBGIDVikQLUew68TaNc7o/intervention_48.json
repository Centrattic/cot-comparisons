We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being angry that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and there's a walk-in closet with the late wife's belongings that he hasn't sorted out. He told his fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space. She ended up trying on some of the late wife's clothes, which upset him.\n\nFirst, the author's anger seems to stem from emotional sensitivity around his late wife's belongings. It's understandable that these items are a reminder of his loss and might be private to him. However, the way he reacted might be problematic. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could use the closet if there was space, which could imply that the clothes weren't off-limits. She might have thought it was acceptable to try them on, especially if she didn't realize they were sacred to him. His immediate reaction was to accuse her of stretching the dress, which could be interpreted as body-shaming, even if that wasn't his intention. He did apologize, but the damage was done.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e should have been more considerate of his feelings regarding his late wife's clothes. Even if space permitted, using items belonging to another person, especially a deceased one, without permission might be a boundary issue. However, the author's communication might have been unclear. If he had explicitly stated that those clothes were not to be touched, the situation might have been avoided.\n\nThe key here is about boundaries and communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset, but his reaction was hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked before using the clothes, but the author could have been clearer about his boundaries. However, since he gave permission for her to use the closet, her actions might not be entirely her fault. The author's comment about the dress size was the immediate issue, which caused the hurt feelings. So, while both may have some responsibility, the author's harsh reaction makes him more at fault here.\n"
