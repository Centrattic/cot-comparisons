We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. The situation is complicated because he's a widower who just lost his wife two years ago, and his fianc\u00e9e is moving in with him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotions involved. The author is still grieving, and the clothes belong to his late wife. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission. That seems like a breach of personal space and respect for the deceased. But then, the author's reaction included a comment about the fianc\u00e9e stretching the dress, which he later realized was a hurtful remark.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is in a sensitive position too\u2014dating a man with kids and a deceased spouse. She might not fully understand the boundaries, especially if she was previously the piano teacher. However, trying on someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered inappropriate, especially when those clothes are of a deceased person. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable given his grief, but his reaction could have been handled better. He apologized, but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying on the clothes, which is a big no-no, and whether the author's anger was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9e's action was disrespectful to his memory and boundaries. On the other hand, the author's comment about her size was unkind, even if unintentional. However, the main issue is the act of trying on the clothes. So, the author's anger might not be entirely in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e did something that was inappropriate. But his harsh words did hurt her, so he's partially at fault. But the primary responsibility is on the fianc\u00e9e for not respecting his wishes and the late wife's belongings. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a boundary. However, there's nuance. The author's harsh words were wrong, but the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the fianc\u00e9e's action was the main issue. Since the author was explicit about not wanting the clothes tried on, her action was the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
