We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset with his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a widower who married his first wife for 11 years, and she died two years ago. He's now engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who used to be his daughter's teacher. They've been dating for a year and are engaged for two weeks. The issue is that the fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from his late wife's closet without permission, which upset him.\n\nHe told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. But when he found her trying on the clothes, he got angry and made a comment about the dress stretching, implying she was too big for it. He later apologized but she was hurt.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for being angry. Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He's still grieving, the clothes are personal items from his late wife. The closet is a sensitive space for him. He didn't clean it out, so maybe he expected it to remain untouched. The fianc\u00e9e's action might have crossed a boundary he hadn't communicated clearly. His reaction was emotional, but he later apologized. However, the comment about the dress was hurtful.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective: She was allowed to store her clothes, maybe she didn't realize the emotional significance. She might have thought trying on the clothes was okay since they were in a shared space. Her action might have been innocent but unaware of the author's feelings. She got hurt when he lashed out, which could indicate that the author's reaction was disproportionate.\n\nGrief and boundaries: The author might still be in a place where his late wife's belongings are a sensitive topic. The fianc\u00e9e may not have known that. However, he should have communicated his feelings about the closet. He told her she could store things there, but maybe didn't set clear boundaries about not using the clothes. \n\nThe comment about the dress: Even if he didn't mean it, saying \"you're stretching out the dress\" could be interpreted as a body-shaming comment, which is definitely wrong. The author should be careful with his words, especially in a sensitive situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author is partially wrong for not clearly communicating his feelings about the closet and his late wife's belongings. He should have discussed what was acceptable regarding those items. His reaction was impulsive and included a hurtful comment. However, the fianc\u00e9e also crossed a boundary by trying on the clothes without asking, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't set clear boundaries and his initial anger led to a hurtful remark, it's more on him. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake, but the author's handling of the situation was worse. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
