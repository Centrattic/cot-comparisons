We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for being angry with his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e was his daughter's piano teacher and they started dating a year ago. She's moving in, and there's a walk-in closet with the deceased wife's clothes. The author didn't want to clean it out and told his fianc\u00e9e she could use the space if there was room. However, she ended up trying on the clothes without permission.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author's emotional response. He got angry and said something about the dress being stretched, implying she was fat. That's clearly hurtful, even if unintentional. The fianc\u00e9e was crying and felt hurt. The author apologized but regrets the comment. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without asking. The closet is a personal space containing the late wife's belongings, which are likely sensitive to the author. The author didn't explicitly tell her not to go through those clothes, just mentioned she could use the space if there was room. So maybe the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying them on, thinking it was okay to use the space.\n\nBut the author's reaction was harsh. Even if he's upset, calling her an asshole and making a comment about her size was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that the author is holding her to a higher standard or not considering her intentions. She might have thought she was being helpful or just didn't realize the sensitivity of the items. However, the author has the right to feel that his late wife's belongings are private and shouldn't be tried on, especially without explicit permission.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of both. The author's reaction was definitely part of the problem because of the hurtful comment. However, the fianc\u00e9e did cross a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission. But in AITA scenarios, sometimes the person's reaction is what's most scrutinized. The author's immediate reaction was to lash out, which might make him more at fault here. However, the fianc\u00e9e's actions also contributed. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. The author is not necessarily wrong for being upset, as the items are personal and the fianc\u00e9e overstepped. However, his response was inappropriate. The main issue is his comment about the dress and calling her an asshole. That's where he's clearly in the wrong. So, while both have some responsibility, the author's actions in the moment are what caused the hurt. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was the immediate problem, even if the fianc\u00e9e's action was also an issue.\n"
