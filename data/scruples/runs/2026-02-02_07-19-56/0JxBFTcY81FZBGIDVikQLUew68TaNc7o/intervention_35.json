We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being upset that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago and is now engaged to his girlfriend, who is also his eldest daughter's former piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in with him, and they're in the process of getting married. The walk-in closet has his late wife's clothes, which he hasn't cleaned out. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her clothes there if there was space. However, she ended up trying on the late wife's clothes without permission, which upset him. He got angry, made a comment about her size in comparison, and then apologized but she was still hurt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions: She tried on the late wife's clothes without asking. This could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially considering the emotional weight of the late wife's belongings. The author might feel that those clothes are sacred or personal, and her actions could be disrespectful or intrusive. However, it's also possible that the fianc\u00e9e didn't realize the sensitivity of the situation, especially if the author didn't explicitly state that no one should touch the items. The author told her she could store her clothes there if there was space, which might have given her the impression that the space was shared, but maybe not the personal items themselves.\n\nThe author's reaction: He got angry and made a hurtful comment about her trying to stretch the dress. Even if he meant to imply that the dress was too big for the late wife (who was a different size), the way he phrased it could have come off as implying the fianc\u00e9e was fat. This is a clear misstep. The author regretted the comment, but the damage was done. His initial anger is understandable given the emotional context, but his choice of words was inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author might not have clearly communicated that the late wife's clothes were off-limits. If he had, the fianc\u00e9e might have had more respect. However, given that these are personal items of a deceased person, it's reasonable to expect that others would be cautious about handling them without permission. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional significance and thought it was just unused clothing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was harsh. He could have handled the situation with more empathy, acknowledging the fianc\u00e9e's intentions while expressing his discomfort. His outburst and the specific comment about the dress were unnecessarily hurtful, especially since the fianc\u00e9e was trying to integrate into his home. \n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, the author's hurtful comment and initial anger are problematic. However, the fianc\u00e9e also overstepped by trying on the clothes without permission. But in the context of a relationship where emotional sensitivity is key, especially dealing with grief, the author's reaction might be seen as more damaging. The author is expected to set boundaries and communicate them clearly, especially regarding personal items of a deceased loved one. If he didn't communicate that clearly, part of the fault lies there. However, once the situation happened, his response was inappropriate.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, but the author's reaction was also inappropriate. However, since the question is about the author's responsibility, and he did lash out with a hurtful comment, which is a clear misstep, he might be in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation. The answer could depend on whether the author's reaction was justified given the context. However, the fact that he acknowledged his mistake and apologized might mitigate some of the blame. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since both sides have some faults, but the author's reaction was more directly harmful, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong (Answer A). However, the fianc\u00e9e's action also contributed. But given the way the question is phrased, focusing on the author's anger, the answer might be that he is in the wrong.\n"
