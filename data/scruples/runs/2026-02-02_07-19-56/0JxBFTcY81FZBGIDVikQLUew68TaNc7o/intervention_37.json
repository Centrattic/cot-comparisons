We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 36-year-old widower who's engaged to his girlfriend, who is 24. They've been dating a year and engaged for two weeks. The key issue is about the fianc\u00e9e trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, the author's deceased wife had a lot of clothes in a walk-in closet. He hadn't cleaned it out yet, maybe because it's still too emotional. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space. Then, when she tried on the clothes, he got angry. His main point is that he's upset she did that without permission, but he also lashed out by saying she was stretching the dress, which he later regretted.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e was in the master bedroom moving in, which is their shared space now. She might not have realized the emotional significance of the clothes, especially since the author didn't explicitly tell her not to touch them. However, he did mention she could store her clothes there, so maybe there was an assumption she could use the space otherwise. But the clothes are personal items from his late wife, which could be a sensitive area. \n\nThe author's reaction was harsh. He should have communicated his boundaries earlier. By not clearly stating that the clothes shouldn't be touched, he might have left room for misunderstanding. When he found out, his response was to criticize her size and the fit of the clothes, which could come off as cruel, even if that wasn't his intention. The fianc\u00e9e might have felt disrespected, especially if the comment about body size was implied, even if uninvited.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e did go into a space that contains his late wife's belongings without permission. Even if the closet was shared, the emotional weight of those items could make it an inappropriate action. However, the author's responsibility is to set clear boundaries. Since he didn't, part of the blame might fall on him for not being explicit about what shouldn't be done.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, trying on someone else's clothes, especially those of a deceased person, is generally considered inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the sensitivity, but the author's failure to communicate his feelings in advance is a point against him. His reaction, while understandable given the emotional context, was not handled well. He should have addressed the situation calmly, explaining why the clothes are off-limits rather than lashing out. \n\nSo considering both sides, the author's main fault was not setting clear boundaries upfront and then reacting in a hurtful way. The fianc\u00e9e's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response escalated the issue. Therefore, the author is partially at fault, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he was the one who didn't communicate his boundaries and then acted in a hurtful manner, the answer would lean towards yes, he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
