We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from his deceased wife, and he got mad. The author is a widower, married for 11 years, with four kids. The fianc\u00e9e was their piano teacher and they've been dating for a year. Now, she tried on the late wife's clothes, and he got angry, even making a comment about the dress stretching, which he later regretted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. The author is still grieving, and the clothes are personal items from his late wife. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the sensitivity of those items. On the other hand, the author's reaction included an implied insult about her body, which was hurtful. The key points are: Did he have a right to be angry about the clothes, and was his reaction appropriate?\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission, which is a problem. The author told her she could store her clothes there, but didn't mention the personal items. So maybe she misunderstood the boundaries. However, the author's anger led to an inappropriate comment. The real issue is whether his reaction was justified given the context.\n\nHe was in a vulnerable place, dealing with grief and the impending marriage. But responding with an insult, even if he regretted it, is not healthy. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings were hurt, and the author needs to consider her perspective too. Maybe he should have expressed his feelings without attacking her. The situation is a mix of unresolved grief and communication issues. So, while the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, the author's reaction was wrong because of the harmful comment. Therefore, both have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since his response was hurtful, maybe answer A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction was inappropriate, even if the situation was sensitive.\n"
