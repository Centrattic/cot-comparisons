We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. He's engaged to his girlfriend, who is now moving in. The fianc\u00e9e, who was the daughter's piano teacher, is trying on the late wife's clothes in the shared walk-in closet. The author found her and got angry, even if he later regretted his words. \n\nSo, the main issues here are boundaries around a deceased spouse's belongings and how the author handled the situation. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which the author saw as crossing a line. However, the author's response included a comment about her size, which he later regretted. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is still grieving. The clothes are personal items from his late wife, and someone else using them might be a trigger. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not fully understand the sensitivity of those items. The author's anger is understandable, but his reaction included a hurtful comment.\n\nThe key points are: the fianc\u00e9e's action of trying on the clothes without consent, the author's right to set boundaries, and the inappropriate remark made. The author is justified in being upset about the clothes being used without permission, but his choice of words exacerbated the situation. However, the core issue is the fianc\u00e9e's lack of respect for the deceased's belongings. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his anger is valid. While he's not in the wrong for being upset, his reaction (especially the comment about her size) was wrong. However, the initial anger might be seen as a reaction to a boundary being crossed. \n\nBut in terms of the main question, is he in the wrong for being mad? The fianc\u00e9e acted without permission, so the author's anger is somewhat justified. However, the way he expressed it was inappropriate. But the main question isn't about the comment but about being mad in the first place. \n\nSo, the author's anger is understandable, but the comment was harmful. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach of privacy and respect. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but his response was wrong. However, the core question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. \n\nIn terms of the options, the answer is either A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. Since the fianc\u00e9e trespassed on personal items, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about that. The answer is B (No).\n"
