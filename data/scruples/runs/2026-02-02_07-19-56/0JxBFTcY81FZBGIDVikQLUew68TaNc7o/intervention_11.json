We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset when his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago and now is engaged to his girlfriend, who is also his eldest daughter's former piano teacher. They're moving in together, and the fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from the author's late wife's walk-in closet without permission. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress stretching out, which he later realized sounded like he was calling her fat. She was hurt by his reaction.\n\nNow, considering the emotional angles. The author is still grieving his wife, which is understandable after two years, especially with four kids to take care of. The clothes might hold sentimental value, and it's natural to want privacy regarding personal belongings of a deceased spouse. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive this issue is. She was moving into the master bedroom and was given permission to store some clothes in the walk-in, but she crossed a line by trying on the late wife's clothes without consent. \n\nThe author's anger is justified to some extent because the clothes are personal items. However, his reaction could have been better handled. Making a comment about the dress stretching out, even if not intended as an insult, was hurtful and unnecessary. He immediately regretted it, which shows he understands that part was wrong. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's action of trying on the clothes without permission is a breach of the author's emotional boundaries. However, the author's lashing out and using a comment that could be perceived as body-shaming is definitely in the wrong. Even if he didn't mean it that way, the impact of his words matters. \n\nSo, the key points are: the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying on clothes without permission, which is a valid reason for the author to be upset. But the author's response was inappropriate because of the hurtful comment. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong for his reaction, while the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for her actions. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the immediate situation, the answer would lean towards A (Yes) because his reaction, especially the comment, was hurtful and not handled well, even if his initial anger was due to her actions.\n"
