We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. He's engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who is his kids' piano teacher. They're moving in together, and she tried on his late wife's clothes without asking. He got angry, called her out, and then used a comment about the dress that hurt her feelings. He apologizes but she's still upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's anger is about his fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes that belong to his deceased wife. That seems like a sensitive issue. The clothes are personal items from someone he was married to for 11 years. It's understandable that he's not ready to part with them and might find her actions disrespectful. However, he did say \"you're stretching out the dress,\" which was a comment about her size. His wife was a different size, so this remark could be interpreted as implying she's overweight, which was clearly hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission before trying on the clothes. She might not have realized how sensitive that closet was to him. But he did tell her she could store her clothes there if there was space, which might have given her the impression that the closet was shared. The confusion here is about boundaries and communication.\n\nHe got angry, but the way he expressed it was harmful. The remark about the dress was inappropriate, even if accidental. He apologized, but she felt he lashed out. So, he's partly wrong for the hurtful comment, but he also has valid feelings about her using his late wife's belongings without permission. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the comment about her size. That was a direct personal attack and was clearly hurtful. Even if he was upset, that remark crossed a line. He should have addressed the situation without making a size-related comment. So, he's in the wrong for that specific action. The fianc\u00e9e is also in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries regarding the late wife's belongings. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the answer hinges on his part. \n\nThe key here is that while his feelings are valid, the way he expressed his anger was inappropriate. Therefore, he is at least partially at fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he made a hurtful comment, even if in anger, the answer is likely yes. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he made a personal remark about her size, which was inappropriate and hurtful, even if his initial anger was about her using the clothes without permission. The comment about the dress is what caused the immediate hurt, making him at fault in that interaction.\n"
