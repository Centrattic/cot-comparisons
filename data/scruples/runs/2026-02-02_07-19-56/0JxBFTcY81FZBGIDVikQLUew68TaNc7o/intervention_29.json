We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes without permission, and he got angry, leading to some hurt feelings. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower, and his wife passed away two years ago. He's now engaged to someone who is close to his kids and his ex-wife's clothes are still in the closet. The fianc\u00e9e used to be the piano teacher for the kids, so there's a history there. \n\nThe author mentioned that the closet has his ex-wife's clothes, and he hasn't cleaned it out yet. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space. But then when he found her trying on the clothes, he got angry. His reaction was to yell at her, saying she was stretching the dress, which he later realized was a hurtful comment because the ex-wife was a size 0 and his fianc\u00e9e isn't. He apologized but it didn't help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. \n\nOn one hand, the ex-wife's clothes are personal items of someone who passed away. The author might feel that these are sacred or private items, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask for permission to go through them. That could be a breach of privacy or respect for his late wife. The author's emotional attachment to his deceased wife might make this a sensitive issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e didn't know the clothes were off-limits. The author had mentioned the closet existed and allowed her to store her clothes there. If the author didn't clearly communicate that the closet wasn't to be used for the clothes, then maybe the fianc\u00e9e isn't entirely at fault. However, the author also has a duty to respect his late wife's belongings, which might mean keeping them private. \n\nBut the main issue here is the author's reaction. He yelled at her and made a comment about her size, which was clearly hurtful. Even if he's justified in being upset about her trying on the clothes, his method of expressing that was inappropriate. He didn't approach it calmly or have a discussion. Instead, he lashed out, which caused emotional harm. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions could be seen as a privacy violation, but the author's response was harsh. The key here is that while both parties might have some fault, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did the hurtful comment and reacted angrily without considering her feelings, he's more at fault here. \n\nAdditionally, the author's fianc\u00e9e was trying to integrate into his life, and this incident might have been a misunderstanding. The author needed to set boundaries about the closet earlier. Since he allowed her to store her clothes there but didn't specify that the other items were off-limits, she might not have realized the sensitivity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the fianc\u00e9e's actions were inconsiderate, the author's reaction was the more significant issue. He should have communicated his boundaries and handled the situation with more emotional control. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
