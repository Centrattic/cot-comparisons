We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothing. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who married his fianc\u00e9e, who was previously his daughter's piano teacher. They've been engaged for two weeks and are moving in together. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from the author's late wife's walk-in closet, which he hasn't cleaned out. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress being \"stretched out,\" which made the fianc\u00e9e cry because his late wife was a different size.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries, respect, and communication. The author had told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes in the closet if there was space, but he hadn't given permission for her to go through his late wife's belongings. His reaction included a hurtful comment about her size, which is definitely wrong. Even if he was upset, making a comment about her body size, especially when his late wife was a different size, is inappropriate and could be seen as a personal attack.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e did go through the clothes without permission, which the author has a right to be upset about. The walk-in closet with personal items of his deceased wife is a sensitive area, and he might expect certain boundaries around those items. That said, his response was harsh and unkind, which escalated the situation. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable given the situation and his history of grief. However, the way he expressed his anger\u2014especially the comment about the dress\u2014was not appropriate. He should have communicated his discomfort with her going through his late wife's belongings and set clearer boundaries without attacking her body. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e also might have been aware of the sensitivity of the situation and should have discussed it with him before going through the clothes. But the author's response, while justified in being upset, was handled poorly. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, both parties have some responsibility. The author shouldn't have made the hurtful comment, but the fianc\u00e9e should have respected his wishes to leave the items untouched. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did make a hurtful remark and his anger led to an inappropriate response, even if his initial upset was valid, he's partially at fault. But the main issue is whether he's entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction included making a personal and hurtful comment about his fianc\u00e9e's size, which is unacceptable regardless of the situation. Plus, he didn't handle his emotions well, leading to more harm. The fianc\u00e9e's action was also a boundary issue, but the author's response was more damaging.\n"
