We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on items from their deceased wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago and is now engaged to someone who used to be his daughter's piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and there's a walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings. The author hadn't cleaned it out and had told the fianc\u00e9e she could use the space if there was room. However, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the late wife's clothes without permission, which upset the author.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's reaction. He got angry and said something hurtful about the fianc\u00e9e's size, leading to her crying. He later apologized but she was still hurt. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes, despite the way he handled it.\n\nI need to break this down. On one hand, the late wife's belongings might be very personal and a sensitive topic for the author. The fianc\u00e9e went into the closet and tried on items without asking, which the author might see as crossing a boundary. The author had given permission to store her own clothes if there was space but didn't mention using the items. So, from the author's perspective, it's a violation of trust or privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might have thought that since the author allowed her to store clothes in the closet, she could use the items. Maybe she didn't realize they were such a sensitive issue. The fact that the author hadn't cleaned out the closet might mean that the clothes were still in a state where they could be used, but that doesn't necessarily mean the fianc\u00e9e had the right to try them on.\n\nNow, the author's reaction: he got angry and made a comment about her size, which was hurtful. Even though he apologized, the initial outburst was problematic. However, the root of his anger is the emotional hurt from the fianc\u00e9e's action. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, so the author is justified in being upset. But the way he expressed that anger was inappropriate. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary violation, then the author isn't wrong for being angry about that. But his handling of the situation (the hurtful comment) was wrong. The original question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. The key here is the justification for his anger. If the action itself was a boundary issue, then he's not in the wrong for being upset. However, the way he expressed that anger is a separate issue.\n\nBut the post is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad, not for the hurtful comment. So, perhaps the answer is that he's not in the wrong for being upset, but his reaction was wrong. But the way the question is phrased, the focus is on the anger itself, not the reaction to it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fianc\u00e9e did cross a line by trying on the clothes without permission, so the author's anger is understandable. However, the author should have managed his emotions better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for being mad. \n\nIn some perspectives, it's about respecting the deceased's belongings. The fianc\u00e9e's action could be seen as disrespectful to the author's late wife, which he would be justified in being upset about. So the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but his handling of the situation (the comment about her size) is. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong for the anger itself. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, and he has a right to be upset. However, his reaction was wrong. But the original question is about the anger, not the reaction. So the answer depends on whether trying on the clothes is a valid reason for anger. \n\nAnother angle: the author had told her she could store her clothes if there was space, but didn't mention the contents of the closet. So perhaps the fianc\u00e9e should have asked before using the items. The author's anger is a result of her not respecting his boundaries. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for being angry. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but his reaction was inappropriate. The main question is about the anger, so the answer would be B."
