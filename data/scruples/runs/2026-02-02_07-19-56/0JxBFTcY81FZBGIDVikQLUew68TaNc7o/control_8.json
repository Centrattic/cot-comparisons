We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 36-year-old man who's engaged to his fianc\u00e9e. He's a widower with four kids from his previous marriage. His ex-wife died two years ago, and the fianc\u00e9e was his oldest daughter's piano teacher before they started dating. Now, she's moving in with him into the master bedroom where his late wife's clothes are still stored.\n\nThe main issue is that the fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes without permission. The user found her doing this, got angry, and made a comment about the dress stretching out, which he later realized was hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and accused him of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. The user is still grieving, and his late wife's belongings might be a sensitive area for him. He didn't clean it out and told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space. So, he might have expected her to respect the space as a private area for his memories.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not fully understand the emotional weight of his late wife's clothes. She tried on the clothes without permission, which could be seen as intrusive. However, her intention might have been innocent, like wanting to see if the clothes fit or were usable. But boundaries are important, especially in a relationship where one partner is still dealing with loss.\n\nThe user's reaction was to shout about the dress stretching, which was a poor choice of words. Even though his intention wasn't to insult her size, the comment came off as hurtful. He apologized, but she felt lashed out at. This shows that his approach was aggressive and not communicative.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, both have some responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission, which the user found upsetting. However, the user's response was inappropriate, especially the comment about her size, which caused emotional harm. While he has the right to be upset about the intrusion, how he expressed it was problematic.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the user is partially at fault for his harsh response, but the fianc\u00e9e also overstepped by not respecting his boundaries. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he did have the right to be upset about her actions, but his reaction was inappropriate, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his response was hurtful and not handled well, but it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, maybe B (No) because his feelings are valid, but his method of expression was wrong. The community might see that the fianc\u00e9e's action was the main issue, but the user's reaction made it worse. So perhaps the answer is A because he lashed out and didn't communicate properly, even though his feelings are valid.\n"
