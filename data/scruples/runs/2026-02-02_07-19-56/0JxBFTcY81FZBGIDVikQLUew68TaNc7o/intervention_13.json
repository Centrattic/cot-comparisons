We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being upset that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lost his wife two years ago. They had four kids, and he's been struggling as a single dad. His fianc\u00e9e, who was the kids' piano teacher, is moving in. There's a walk-in closet with his late wife's clothes that he hasn't cleaned out. He allowed her to store some of her clothes there. She tried on some of the late wife's clothes, and he got angry, even making a comment about her stretching the dress, which he later regretted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the late wife's clothes are personal items. The author hasn't dealt with cleaning them out, so they hold emotional value. Maybe he's still grieving, and seeing his fianc\u00e9e in those clothes could be triggering. His reaction might stem from unresolved feelings or a need for privacy regarding his late wife's belongings. He did apologize, showing he recognizes his mistake in the comment about her size.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e was allowed to use the closet. She might not have realized the emotional significance of the clothes. Her actions were perhaps innocent, just trying to use the space they were given. The author's anger and the specific comment about the dress size could be seen as harsh, especially since he admitted it was wrong. He gave permission for her to store clothes, so her trying them on might have been a misunderstanding of boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's fianc\u00e9e was hurt and felt lashed out at. Even if the author was upset about the clothes, the way he reacted (calling her fat indirectly) was inappropriate and could have been handled better. His regret shows he understands that he overstepped in that aspect.\n\nBut the core issue is whether trying on the clothes without permission was wrong. The author didn't explicitly say she couldn't touch the clothes, but he had not cleaned them out. The clothes are his late wife's, so he has the right to decide who uses them. However, the fianc\u00e9e might not have known that those specific items were off-limits, especially if the closet was shared for storage.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's often a taboo around using someone else's deceased partner's clothing without consent. It can be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. However, the author's reaction might be too strong, especially since he was in a vulnerable position. The key here is communication. If he didn't clarify the boundaries about the clothes, then he can't expect her to know not to use them. But once she did, his response was harsh.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely wrong for being upset about the clothes, but his reaction (especially the size comment) was definitely in the wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry about the clothes themselves. The initial anger might be understandable due to grief, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer could be that he's not entirely in the wrong for being upset about the clothes, but he did act wrongly in his response. However, the question is phrased as whether he's in the wrong for being mad about the trying on. The main issue is whether the action of trying on clothes is wrong. Since he didn't specify she couldn't do that, but the clothes are sensitive, it's a bit nuanced. In many cases, people might feel that the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, but the author's reaction was excessive. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong for the anger but is in the wrong for his reaction. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad, not for his reaction. The user's own thought is that he is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they think trying on the clothes was okay. \n\nAnother angle: The clothes are his late wife's. The fianc\u00e9e didn't respect his space by trying them on without permission. Even if the closet was shared, the emotional value of the clothes might mean they should be kept private. So, the author has a right to be upset. However, if he didn't communicate that clearly, then the fianc\u00e9e might not have known. So it's a mix. But ultimately, the author's anger is partially justified, but his reaction was not. The question is whether he is in the wrong for being angry about the act itself. If the act is considered wrong, then he's justified. If not, then he's not. But societal norms often consider using a deceased spouse's clothes as a sensitive issue, so maybe the author's anger is reasonable. However, the way he expressed it was not. The answer hinges on whether trying on the clothes without permission was wrong. If yes, then he's not in the wrong. If no, then he is. Given that the user leans towards the author being in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. In many cases, people might say that the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, so the author isn't entirely wrong. But if the author didn't set boundaries, then it's shared responsibility. However, the author's grief might make it a sensitive area that he needs to protect. So the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the act of trying on the clothes without permission is disrespectful, and his anger is understandable, though his reaction was inappropriate. But the main question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. If the act itself is wrong, then he's justified. So the answer is B.\n"
