We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes of the author's deceased wife, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago and has four kids. His fianc\u00e9e used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher, which is interesting. They started dating a year ago and are getting married. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in and is using the master bedroom where the author's late wife's clothes are stored.\n\nThe key issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the late wife's clothes without permission. The author found her doing this, got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about her stretching the dress, which he later regretted. He apologized, but she was still hurt. The author is asking if he's at fault for being angry about her trying on the clothes, even though he admitted saying something about her size was wrong.\n\nNow, I need to break this down. The author's anger stems from the fact that the clothes belong to his deceased wife. To him, those clothes are personal items that might hold sentimental value, and he might not want them disturbed. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, might not have realized the emotional weight of those items. She could have thought it was a closet available for use, as the author mentioned she could store her clothes if there was space. However, she went beyond that by trying on the clothes, which the author found offensive.\n\nThe author's comment about her stretching the dress, given the late wife's size, was clearly hurtful. Even if he didn't mean to imply she was fat, the comment was inappropriate. But the main question is whether he's at fault for being angry in the first place. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the clothes are sacred or at least private. He might feel that the fianc\u00e9e's actions were a violation of his late wife's memory. However, the fianc\u00e9e might not have understood the sensitivity of the situation. The author's right to be upset about her using the clothes without permission is debatable. On one hand, he didn't clean out the closet yet, but he also didn't communicate clearly that those items were off-limits. \n\nBut the key points here are consent and communication. The author told her she could use the closet if there was space, which might have led her to believe that the unoccupied space was available. However, he didn't specify that the existing clothes weren't to be touched. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach of boundaries, but the author's communication might have been unclear. \n\nThe author's reaction, while understandable given his grief, included a hurtful comment. However, being angry about the act itself is a different matter. Is it the author's fault for being upset? Or is the fianc\u00e9e at fault for not respecting his boundaries? It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for being angry, but his communication of boundaries could have been clearer. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked or been more respectful of the items' significance. \n\nHowever, the author is the one who owns the clothes and the closet. He's responsible for setting clear boundaries. If he didn't explicitly state that those items shouldn't be touched, then perhaps he's partially at fault. But if he implied they were just stored there and didn't restrict access, then the fianc\u00e9e might have misunderstood. The comment about her size was definitely wrong, but the initial anger could be justified if the author felt the action was disrespectful. \n\nIn the end, the situation is a mix of both parties. The author's grief and the fianc\u00e9e's lack of awareness. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but his communication could have been better. However, the fianc\u00e9e's actions were a breach. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but he did have a communication issue. Alternatively, maybe he is partially at fault for not being clear. \n\nBut the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes without permission. The author has the right to be upset about that. So the answer is B. He's not in the wrong.\n"
