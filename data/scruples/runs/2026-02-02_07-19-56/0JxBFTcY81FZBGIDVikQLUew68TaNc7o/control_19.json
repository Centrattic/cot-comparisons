We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 36-year-old widower with four kids. His wife died two years ago, and he's been in a tough spot since. His fianc\u00e9e, who is 24 and was previously his daughter's piano teacher, is moving in with him. The master bedroom's walk-in closet still has his late wife's belongings, which he hasn't cleaned out. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could use the space if there was room. She tried on a dress and other items from his late wife without asking, and he got angry, said \"you're stretching out the dress,\" which he later realized sounded like a body comment. He apologized but she was hurt.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respecting the deceased's belongings and how he handled the situation. \n\nHe's in a vulnerable position, grieving and having not dealt with the closet yet. The fianc\u00e9e might not realize how sensitive this is. But, he did give permission for her to store clothes in the closet if there was space. That implies that he might have thought it was okay for her to go through the items to find space. However, trying on a deceased spouse's clothes might be a boundary he didn't explicitly set. \n\nEven though he gave permission for storage, the act of trying on the clothes could be seen as overstepping, especially considering the emotional weight. His reaction was anger, which is understandable, but the specific comment about stretching the dress was hurtful. He should have addressed the situation without making a body-related remark. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might have been curious or not considered the emotional impact. But since she's marrying him, she should be aware of his feelings regarding his late wife. The problem also includes the kids; maybe the clothes are part of their memories. \n\nThe author's right to be upset is valid because the clothes are personal items from his deceased wife. However, the way he expressed his anger\u2014especially the comment about the dress\u2014was inappropriate. He should have communicated his boundaries earlier and handled the situation with more empathy. \n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9e may have crossed a line, but the author's reaction, while understandable, was also wrong because of the hurtful comment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how he expressed his anger, even if the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e was insensitive. \n\nAnswer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong. He gave permission to use the space, and while the fianc\u00e9e's action was inappropriate, his response with the body comment was unkind. However, the situation is complex. But based on the question, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad about her trying on the clothes. The main issue is his reaction. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) question often looks at both parties, but the answer here might be A because he shouldn't have lashed out in that way, even if her action was wrong. The comment about stretching out the dress was a body-shaming remark, which is definitely on him. Even if the fianc\u00e9e's action was crossing a boundary, the author's reaction exacerbated the problem. So he's partly at fault for the way he handled it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
