We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being angry with their fianc\u00e9e for trying on his late wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower with four kids, and his fianc\u00e9e is someone the kids know and like. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes from his late wife's closet. The author found her doing this, got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about her stretching the dress, which he later regretted. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author hadn't cleaned out the closet, so there's a question about whether the clothes should still be considered private. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which might be a breach of the author's emotional boundaries. However, the author's reaction included a potentially hurtful comment about her body, which he now regrets. \n\nThe author admits he was wrong to imply she was fat, which is a valid point. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that trying on the clothes wasn't a big deal, but for the author, those items are a personal and emotional space related to his late wife. \n\nSo, who is at fault? The fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by using the clothes without asking, which could be hurtful. The author overreacted with a harsh comment, which is unforgivable, but his anger stems from personal grief. \n\nIt's a mix of both. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through the clothes without permission, but the author's reaction was inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but is that accurate?\n\nThe author's main issue is being mad about the action, but he also reacted poorly. The fianc\u00e9e may be wrong for trying on the clothes, but the author's response exacerbates the problem. The question is if the author is in the wrong for being mad. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something that could be seen as intrusive, the author has a right to be upset. However, his reaction was inappropriate. So the answer might be a mix, but the options are A or B. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's anger is justified because of the emotional significance of the clothes, but his comment about the dress was wrong. However, the question is about being mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. If the author is in the wrong, it would be because his anger was unwarranted. But if the fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a boundary, then the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nThe key is whether the action of trying on the clothes without permission is a valid reason for anger. The author might have an emotional right to be upset, but the fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but his reaction made things worse. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong for being mad. If the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, then the author's anger is understandable, but his response was wrong. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because his anger is partly justified, though his reaction was bad. But the user says they think the author is in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The main point is about trying on the clothes without permission. The author might have expressed his feelings about the clothes being a personal space, so the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have done that. If the author communicated that the clothes were off-limits, then the fianc\u00e9e is at fault. But if he didn't, maybe she didn't know. The author mentioned he said she could store her clothes if there was space, implying that maybe she thought some items were okay to use. But the clothes belong to his late wife, so it's a sensitive matter. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not entirely in the wrong for being upset, but his reaction was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e made a mistake by trying on the clothes without permission. So the answer is B for the author not being in the wrong, but he made a mistake in his response.\n"
