We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower with four kids, and his fianc\u00e9e is their former piano teacher. They've been dating a year, engaged for two weeks. The fianc\u00e9e moved in and tried on items from his late wife's walk-in closet. The author got angry, told her to stop, and made a comment about the dress stretching because of her size, which upset her.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries, respect, and communication. The author's late wife's belongings are a sensitive area. The author hasn't cleaned out the closet yet, so it's a space that's still personal to him. The fianc\u00e9e went into that space and tried on clothes without permission. That's a breach of his boundaries, which could be valid for him to be upset about.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might have been harsh. He said something that implied she was fat, which is a direct insult. Even if the intention was to express his anger about the situation, the way he communicated it was hurtful. His fianc\u00e9e felt hurt, called him an asshole, and lashed out, which suggests there's more to the situation. Maybe he didn't handle his emotions well, leading to an explosive reaction.\n\nBut the core issue is whether trying on the clothes without permission was wrong. The author had told her she could store her clothes if there was space, but he didn't specify that the items in there were not to be touched. However, the walk-in closet is described as containing the deceased wife's personal items, which are private. The fianc\u00e9e entering that space and using the clothes might have overstepped, especially since the author hasn't addressed cleaning it out, indicating it's a sensitive area for him.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable given the situation, but his response was inappropriate. He hurt her feelings with a direct insult. However, the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e was a boundary issue. So, there's a shared responsibility here. The author is not entirely in the wrong for being angry about the boundary breach, but his response was wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes, not necessarily his reaction.\n\nWait, the question asks if the author is in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. So, the main issue is his anger at her action. If the action itself (trying on clothes without permission) is wrong, then his anger is justified. But if the action isn't wrong, then he's in the wrong for being angry. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9e overstepped. The author didn't explicitly tell her not to touch those items, but the context of the closet being his late wife's might imply that it's a private space. The fianc\u00e9e moving in and using that space could be seen as intrusive. So, the author's anger is partly justified because the action was a boundary violation. However, his reaction (the comment about her size) was definitely wrong. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong for being angry, not the reaction. So, if the fianc\u00e9e was wrong to try on the clothes, then the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. However, if the fianc\u00e9e's action wasn't wrong, then the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action was a breach. Since the author hasn't cleaned out the closet and it's a sensitive area, the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through those items without permission. Therefore, the author's anger is justified, but his reaction was wrong. However, the question is specifically about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about the action itself, but he's in the wrong for how he expressed it. However, the question is asking if he's in the wrong for being angry. If the action was wrong, then he's not in the wrong for being angry. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but his reaction was wrong. However, the options are A for Yes (he is in the wrong) and B for No (he isn't). So the answer would be B because the action was a boundary violation, so he's not in the wrong for being angry. But then his comment was wrong. However, the question is about the anger itself, not the reaction. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
