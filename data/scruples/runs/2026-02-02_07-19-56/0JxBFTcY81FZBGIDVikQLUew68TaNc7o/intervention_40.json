We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being upset that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lost his wife two years ago and hasn't cleaned out her closet. He told his fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there's space. But then he finds her trying on his late wife's clothes, and he reacts angrily, even making a comment about her stretching out the dress. The fianc\u00e9e is hurt, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's still grieving and hasn't dealt with his wife's belongings. The closet is a personal space with her late wife's items. The fianc\u00e9e used to be the daughter's piano teacher and has a good relationship with the kids. The author might feel that these clothes are sacred or part of his memory, so her trying them on without permission could be a violation of his boundaries. But he did give her permission to store her clothes there if there's space, which might imply that he didn't expect her to use the clothes.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have known the sensitivity of the situation. She might have thought that since the clothes were in the closet and not in a sealed container, it was okay to try them on. But she didn't get his permission, which is a key point. The author's reaction, however, included a hurtful comment about her size, which was probably a knee-jerk reaction but added to the problem. He later apologized but the damage was done.\n\nNow, considering both sides: The author has the right to be upset because the clothes belong to his late wife, and the act of trying them on without permission could be seen as intrusive. However, his reaction was harsh and included a personal jab, which is definitely in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's action was probably inconsiderate, but the author's response escalated the situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry, or if the fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author should have communicated his feelings about the closet more clearly. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have tried on the clothes without asking. But the author's comment about her size was a clear misstep. The initial anger might be understandable, but the way he expressed it was wrong. So, the author is partly in the wrong for his reaction, but the fianc\u00e9e also has some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The answer might hinge on whether his anger is justified. If his anger is about the action (trying on clothes without permission), that's one thing. But his comment was about her body, which is a different issue. So, the author is in the wrong for the comment, but maybe not entirely for being angry about the clothes. But since the question is asking if he's in the wrong overall, the answer would likely be A because his reaction was inappropriate, even if his initial anger was about the action. The main issue is the way he expressed his anger, which caused harm. So, the answer is A.\n"
