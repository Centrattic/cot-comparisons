We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from his late wife, and he got angry. He says he regrets his words about the dress size, but he's still mad about her trying on the clothes without permission. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower with four kids, recently married to his current fianc\u00e9e, who is also his ex-piano teacher. She's moving in, and there's this walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings. He hadn't cleaned it out yet and allowed her to store some clothes there if there was space. She ended up trying on the clothes, which he found upsetting.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Whether trying on the clothes was an overstep, and 2) How the author reacted, especially with the comment about the dress size.\n\nStarting with the first part: the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes. The author had mentioned that the closet wasn't cleaned out yet and allowed her to store some of her own clothes if there was space. However, he might have expected her to avoid going through the late wife's personal items. It's possible she didn't realize the sensitivity of the situation. The clothes are personal mementos, and for the author, they might represent a deceased loved one. In that case, going through or trying on those clothes without permission could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. But on the other hand, if the author had given access to the closet, maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't intend to overstep.\n\nThen there's the reaction. The author's comment about the dress size, implying she was stretching it, which he immediately regretted. That was a direct and hurtful comment, even if not his intention. The fianc\u00e9e was hurt and left in tears. His initial anger led him to a thoughtless remark that clearly hurt her. Even if he apologized, the damage was done. So, his reaction was definitely part of the problem.\n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad about her trying on the clothes. If the clothes were personal items that the author wasn't ready to part with, then her trying them on without permission could be seen as violating his emotional space. However, if the closet was a shared space and the author didn't clearly communicate boundaries, maybe there's some fault on his part for not addressing it earlier. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e might have thought she was just using the space as allowed, not knowing the sensitivity of the clothes. The author might have been wrong to get angry without considering her perspective, assuming she didn't mean to intrude. On the other hand, the clothes are his late wife's, and handling them could be a personal issue. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's reaction was harsh, especially the comment about her size, which was clearly wrong. However, his anger might stem from legitimate emotional pain. But the way he expressed it was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e might not have intended to overstep, but the action was still wrong. \n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe the key is that the author has a right to be upset about her handling his late wife's belongings without permission. However, his reaction was inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong for his harsh reaction, but not necessarily for being upset. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. \n\nIf the author's anger is about the action itself, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he expressed it was wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. If his anger was justified, then he's not in the wrong. But if the action wasn't wrong, then he is. \n\nSo, perhaps the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the act of trying on the clothes without permission is an issue. However, the way he reacted is problematic. But the question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes, not the reaction itself. So maybe he's not in the wrong for being angry, but his reaction was. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. So depending on the perspective. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have done that, so the author has a right to be upset. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. But some might say he should have communicated boundaries earlier. However, the key is whether the act itself is wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e went through the late wife's clothes without permission, which is a violation. His anger is justified, though his reaction was poor. The question is about being mad at her for the action, not the response. So he's not in the wrong for being angry about the action.\n"
