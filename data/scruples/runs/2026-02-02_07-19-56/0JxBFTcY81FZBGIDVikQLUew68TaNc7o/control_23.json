We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a widower who recently started dating his fianc\u00e9e, who used to be his daughter's piano teacher. They're getting married, and she's moving in. The fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes in the walk-in closet. The author got mad, told her to clean up, and maybe said something about the dress being stretched, which he later regretted because the wife was taller and thinner. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes without permission. The clothes belong to his late wife, so there's a sensitive aspect here. The author had told her she could use the closet space, but he didn't give permission for her to go through his late wife's belongings. So, maybe she overstepped by doing that. However, the author's reaction might have been harsh. He lashed out, made a comment about the dress that could imply she was stretching it (maybe a body-shaming remark), and then she got hurt. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable because dealing with a deceased spouse's belongings can be emotional. But his response might have been disproportionate. He apologized, but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt. The key points here are about boundaries and how both parties handled the situation. The author might have been wrong in his harsh reaction, even if the fianc\u00e9e did cross a boundary. Both sides have some responsibility. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether his reaction was justified. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through the clothes without permission, but the author's response might have been unnecessarily harsh. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because his reaction was inappropriate, even if the fianc\u00e9e made a mistake.\n"
