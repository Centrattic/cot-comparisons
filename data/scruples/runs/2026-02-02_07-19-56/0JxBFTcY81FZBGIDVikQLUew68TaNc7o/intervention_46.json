We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's a widower, is getting married to his fianc\u00e9e. She tried on his late wife's clothes without permission, and he got angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. The author is still grieving his wife's death, which happened two years ago. The closet with his wife's belongings is a sensitive space. It's understandable that he's not ready to part with those items. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, might not fully grasp the emotional weight of those clothes. She may have thought it was okay since he told her she could store her own items there if space allowed.\n\nThe key here is consent and boundaries. The author didn't explicitly tell her not to touch the clothes. He just mentioned she could store her own things if there was space. Maybe he assumed that the rest were off-limits, but he didn't communicate that clearly. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the sensitivity of the situation. \n\nThen there's the part where the author called her \"stretched out the dress,\" which was a hurtful comment. He later apologized but the damage was done. Even if he was angry, that remark was a misstep. He's in a vulnerable place, but his reaction might have been too harsh, especially considering the fianc\u00e9e's intentions (though her actions were a boundary issue).\n\nSo, who's at fault? The fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by using the late wife's clothes without asking, which is a big no-no. But the author didn't set clear boundaries, leading to the misunderstanding. His reaction was also inappropriate. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's actions. The author's anger is a reaction to her transgression, but he still handled it poorly. But in terms of who's more in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9e's actions were the initial problem. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to assess. The author didn't explicitly forbid her from touching the clothes. He might have expected her to know, but it's his responsibility to set boundaries. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach of respect. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, even though the author could have handled it better. But the author's harsh comment was his fault. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake, but the author's reaction (name-calling) was wrong. So he's partly at fault, but the main issue is her. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B.\n\nBut the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The author is allowed to be upset. However, his response was inappropriate. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, not for his response. The user says he's in the wrong, but maybe the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e. The author's anger is justified, but his words were not. So maybe the author is not in the wrong (B) because the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, but he should have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. If his anger is justified, then B. If his anger is the problem, then A. \n\nIn this case, the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary cross, so the author's anger is understandable. However, his harsh words were unkind. But the question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. Since she did that without permission, he has a right to be upset. The main problem is the action, but his response was poor. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but he could have handled it better. The question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
