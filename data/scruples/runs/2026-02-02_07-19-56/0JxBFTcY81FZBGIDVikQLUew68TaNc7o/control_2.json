We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry with his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago and was raising four kids alone. The fianc\u00e9e was his daughter's piano teacher and has been helping him during a tough time. Now they're engaged and moving in together.\n\nThe main issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the late wife's clothes. The author says he told her she could store her clothes in the walk-in closet if there was space, but he hasn't cleaned out his wife's belongings. So, did he clearly set boundaries about these items? It seems he might not have. By allowing her to use the closet, maybe he gave a false sense of permission, but the clothes themselves are a sensitive area. \n\nHe found her trying on clothes and other items, which could be seen as invading his privacy or grieving space. His reaction included saying \"you're stretching out the dress,\" which came off as implying she was fat, even if that wasn't his intent. He apologized, but she felt hurt. \n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive those clothes are to him. On the other, the author didn't establish clear boundaries. Maybe he should have communicated that the clothes are off-limits. But the act of trying them on without asking could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe key points are: Did he give permission for her to use those clothes? The answer is no. He only allowed storing her own clothes if space permits. She went beyond that by trying on the late wife's clothes. His anger might be justified due to the emotional value, but his comment about the dress was a mistake. \n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9e is at fault for not respecting the sensitive nature of the items. The author is partially at fault for not setting clear boundaries, but the main issue is her action. However, the way he reacted (calling her fat) definitely hurt her, so he should have been more careful. But is he in the wrong overall? \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at her trying on the clothes. If the clothes are personal and not meant to be used, then her action was wrong. His anger is a reaction to that, but the comment was a misstep. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because her action was a boundary cross, but he should have communicated that. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because he didn't set boundaries and his reaction was harsh. \n\nHmm. In relationships, especially when there's history and loss involved, communication is key. The author didn't explicitly say the closet is off-limits, but he also didn't clean it out. The fianc\u00e9e might have thought it was okay since the closet was available. But trying on someone else's deceased spouse's clothes is a big no-no. The author's anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it was unkind. \n\nI think the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. However, the author could have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't give permission and the clothes are personal, maybe he's not in the wrong. His harsh comment was a mistake, but the core issue isn't. So answer B.\n"
