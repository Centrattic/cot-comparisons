We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e trying on the author's deceased wife's clothes in their shared walk-in closet, and the author getting angry and making a comment about the dress being stretched out, which the fianc\u00e9e took as a body accusation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects here. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The closet still has her personal items, which can be a sensitive area. He mentioned he hasn't cleaned it out and didn't want to, which shows he's still grieving and those clothes are part of his memories. The fianc\u00e9e, who is the current partner, went into the closet and tried on the clothes without permission. That's a key point. The author was upset and said something that came off as personal, leading to her crying and feeling hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction might be understandable because the situation is emotionally charged. The closet with his late wife's belongings is a space that's still tied to his memories. The fianc\u00e9e's action of trying on the clothes without asking could be seen as intrusive, especially if he hasn't discussed or processed this with her. It's possible he felt that she was disrespecting his late wife's things or not respecting his personal space and grief.\n\nOn the other hand, the way he expressed his anger was inappropriate. He used a comment about the dress being stretched out, which, given the size difference, could be taken as a jibe about her body. Even if that wasn't his intention, the wording was hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e was clearly moved in without prior agreement, and he didn't handle the situation with enough care. He should have communicated his feelings about the closet to her before she started using it. Maybe establishing boundaries or discussing how to handle the late wife's belongings would have been better.\n\nAlso, the fact that they are engaged and moving in together means that there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive the closet was. However, trying on clothes without permission could be seen as a breach of that respect. But the author's explosive reaction, especially making an offhand comment that led to her feeling targeted about her size, was harsh. He should have addressed the action without attacking her body, especially since he admitted that it wasn't an issue but the comment was hurtful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some role. The author didn't set clear boundaries about the closet, leaving it ambiguous. The fianc\u00e9e went into a personal space with another person's belongings without asking. However, the author's response was what escalated the situation. Even if the action was wrong, his method of confrontation was not constructive. He should have explained why the closet is important to him and how her actions made him feel, instead of lashing out.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong for being upset about the fianc\u00e9e trying on his late wife's clothes without permission, but he is in the wrong for how he expressed his anger, particularly the comment that hurt her. The answer is a bit nuanced, but since the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, the main issue is his response rather than the initial anger. However, the act of trying on the clothes without asking is also a point to consider. The key here is that his reaction was inappropriate, so he's partly at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The question is about the author's anger at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. If the fianc\u00e9e was in the wrong for that, then the author's anger would be justified, but if her action wasn't, then he's in the wrong. Since the closet has his late wife's belongings and he hadn't discussed it, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized it was off-limits, but the author should have communicated that. However, the question is specifically about the author's anger. So is the author in the wrong for being mad?\n\nHmm. The author is in a position where the closet is a personal space with his late wife's items. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which might be a privacy issue. But since the author had told her she could store her clothes if there was space, maybe the boundary wasn't clear. The author's anger is about the action (trying on clothes without consent), but his reaction was hurtful. So if the action itself is a problem, then he's justified in being angry, but his reaction is where he's in the wrong. The question is whether he is in the wrong for being mad. If the action is wrong, then he's not in the wrong for being mad, but if the action wasn't wrong, then he is. The problem is that the fianc\u00e9e might not have known the clothes were off-limits. The author didn't clean out the closet, so maybe he should have addressed it earlier. Therefore, the author's anger is somewhat justified, but his handling of it was poor. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the question is: \"Is the author in the wrong for being pissed at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes without permission?\" So if the fianc\u00e9e did something that the author felt was a boundary violation, then his anger is understandable. However, if the author didn't set clear boundaries, the fianc\u00e9e might not have known. But the author did say she could store clothes if there was space. The trying on part wasn't discussed. The author is in a sensitive position with his late wife's belongings. So maybe the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, but the author's reaction was wrong. The answer is a mix, but the question is about the author's anger. If the fianc\u00e9e was in the wrong for trying on the clothes, then the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. But if the fianc\u00e9e didn't know it was off-limits, the author's anger is perhaps justified, but his method of expressing it is not. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The options are A or B. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is B because his anger is towards the action, which is a boundary issue, but his delivery was poor. The actual wrong is more on the fianc\u00e9e for not respecting the space, but the user is asking about the author's anger. So the author's anger is not in the wrong, but his words were. The question is specifically about being mad for the action, so the answer would be B. However, if the action isn't wrong, then the author is in the wrong for being mad. Since the author had mentioned he never wanted to clean it out and is still grieving, the closet is a personal space. The fianc\u00e9e's action was inappropriate, so the author's anger is understandable, but he's not in the wrong for being angry. The problem is his response. But the question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. So if the action is wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. Therefore, the answer is B. But wait, the user's question says \"AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my deceased wife's clothing?\" So the main question is about the author's anger. If the fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach of privacy and boundaries, then the author's anger is justified. However, if the author didn't make those boundaries clear, then her action wasn't a breach. So the key is whether the action was wrong. The user says the author told her she could store clothes if there was space. The trying on wasn't discussed. So the author might not have explicitly said it was off-limits. Therefore, the fianc\u00e9e might not have known. However, the author's late wife's belongings in the closet are personal. The fianc\u00e9e's action could be seen as insensitive. So the author is in the right to be upset about the action, but his reaction was wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No), as he's not in the wrong for being mad, but his handling of the situation is where he's at fault. However, the options are AITA for being mad. If the action is not a breach, then he is in the wrong. But the general view is that entering a space with deceased's belongings and trying them on is a privacy issue. So the answer is B.\n"
