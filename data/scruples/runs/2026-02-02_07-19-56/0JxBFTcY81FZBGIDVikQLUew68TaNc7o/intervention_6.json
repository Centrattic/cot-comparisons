We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after getting angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher, which might mean she has been around the family for a while. The author hasn't dealt with cleaning out his late wife's closet, which contains many personal items. He allowed the fianc\u00e9e to store her clothes in the walk-in closet, but she ended up trying on the deceased wife's clothes without his permission.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect for the deceased. The author's anger stems from the fact that someone else is wearing his late wife's belongings, which is a personal and sensitive issue. However, his reaction was to accuse the fianc\u00e9e of \"stretching out the dress,\" implying she's larger than his late wife, which was hurtful and uncalled for. Even though his intention was not to be mean, the way he phrased it was offensive.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions might be seen as intrusive if she didn't have explicit permission to go through those clothes. However, the author had allowed her to store her clothes in the same room where the late wife's items were. There's a question of whether the author had communicated clearly that those clothes were not to be touched. If the closet was still in use as a shared space without clear boundaries, maybe the fianc\u00e9e thought it was acceptable to try some on, especially if they were just stored and not boxed.\n\nBut regardless of that, the author's immediate reaction was to lash out with a comment that was personal and hurtful. That part is definitely on him. He should have expressed his feelings without attacking her body. The fianc\u00e9e was hurt and felt lashed out at, which is valid. Even if the action (trying on clothes) was wrong, the response (insulting her size) was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation calmly. The fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for crossing a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since his reaction was the hurtful comment, which compounded the issue, he shares some responsibility. However, the initial action of trying on the clothes without permission is also a problem. The answer depends on whether the focus is on the fianc\u00e9e's action or the author's reaction.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) genre, the community often looks at both sides. Here, the author's reaction was unkind, even if his feelings were hurt. The fianc\u00e9e overstepped, but the author's response was unhelpful. However, the core issue is about respect for the deceased and boundaries. The author might not be entirely wrong for being upset about the clothes being tried on, but his handling of the situation was poor. So, the author is in the wrong more because of his response than the situation itself. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
