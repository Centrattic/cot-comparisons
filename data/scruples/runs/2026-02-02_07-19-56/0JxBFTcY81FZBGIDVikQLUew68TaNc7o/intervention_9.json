We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. His fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's piano teacher, and they've been dating for a year. They're getting married, and she's moving in. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings, which he hasn't cleaned out. He told her she could store some clothes there if space allowed.\n\nThe key issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes without permission. The author found her doing this and reacted angrily, even making a comment about the dress being stretched because his ex-wife was a different size. He apologized but she was hurt.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author's reaction makes sense. The clothes belong to someone he loved and lost, so it's a sensitive area. He might not have wanted others to go through those items, especially so soon after her death. The fact that he mentioned the size difference, even if it wasn't intentional, could be seen as hurtful. However, his initial anger might be justified given the personal nature of the items and his unresolved feelings.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e was given permission to store her clothes in the closet. She might not have realized how sensitive this area was. Her action of trying on the clothes could be seen as a boundary issue, but she might not have intended to cause harm. The author's reaction, though, was harsh, and the comment about her size could be perceived as a personal attack, even if not meant that way.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author is partially in the wrong for lashing out and making a hurtful comment. However, his feelings about the clothes being a personal, sacred space are valid. The fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission. But the author's response was inappropriate. So, there's a mix here. The question is whether the main fault lies with the author's reaction or the fianc\u00e9e's actions. Since the user asked if the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on the appropriateness of his reaction versus her actions. I think both have some responsibility, but the question is whether the author is the one in the wrong. Since he made a hurtful comment and overreacted, even if he had valid feelings, he's partly at fault. However, the fianc\u00e9e did cross a line. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer should be A. But maybe it's a shared responsibility. The options are A or B. The question is if the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e had permission to store her clothes but didn't ask about the rest, maybe she's also at fault. But the author's reaction was more about his emotional response. So, in terms of who is more at fault, the author's harsh reaction and the comment about size make him at least partially wrong. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
