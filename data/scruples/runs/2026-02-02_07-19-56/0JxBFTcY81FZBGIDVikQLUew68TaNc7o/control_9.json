We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a widower with four kids, married for 11 years. His wife died two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e was his daughter's piano teacher and they started dating a year ago. Now, they're engaged, and she's moving in. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet with the deceased wife's clothes. The author hadn't cleaned it out and told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes if there was space. \n\nShe tried on a dress and other items from the closet without permission. The author found her and reacted angrily, saying she was \"stretching the dress,\" which implied she was fat. He apologized but caused hurt feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nFrom my understanding, the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission. The author specified not to touch those items, and she went ahead anyway. That's a breach of trust. However, the author's reaction was to lash out with a comment that came off as insulting. Even if he didn't mean it, the words were hurtful. \n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9e is wrong for going through the clothes without permission, but the author is wrong in how he handled it. He should have communicated his feelings calmly instead of making a hurtful comment. \n\nBut the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The author had the right to be upset, but his response was inappropriate. So, the author is partially in the wrong because of his reaction, but the fianc\u00e9e is also in the wrong for her actions. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, even if someone is justified in being upset, their method of expressing it can still be at fault. The author's comment about stretching the dress was a personal attack and not appropriate, regardless of his emotions. Therefore, he is at least partially to blame for his reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e should have respected the author's wishes regarding the deceased wife's belongings. So maybe both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, but the author's response was also wrong, the answer depends on the balance. \n\nIn these AITA scenarios, if the person's action (the fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes without permission) is the main issue, but the author's reaction escalated it inappropriately, then the author is in the wrong for his response. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad about the action. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because of the breach of trust, but his expression of that anger was wrong. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but he is in the wrong for how he reacted. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on...\" So the focus is on his anger, not his reaction. \n\nIf the user is asking if it's his fault for being angry, then the answer would be no, because he has a right to be upset. But if the question is whether he's in the wrong for lashing out, then yes. However, the original question is about being mad, not about the reaction. \n\nThe user's main point is: is he in the wrong for being angry that she tried on the clothes. The fianc\u00e9e did something he told her not to do, so his anger is justified. However, his reaction was excessive. The question is whether he is in the wrong for being angry. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the determination is usually whether the person's actions (or in this case, their anger) are justified. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something he specified not to do, his anger is understandable. However, the way he expressed it was wrong. The question is specifically about being angry, not about the method. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for being mad, because his fianc\u00e9e went against his wishes. However, his response was wrong, but the anger itself isn't the issue. \n\nSo, considering the options: A for Yes (author wrong) or B for No. \n\nGiven that the question is about being angry, and the fianc\u00e9e did something he told her not to do, the author is justified in being angry. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). However, he is wrong in how he expressed his anger, but the question isn't about that. \n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad. So the answer is B: No. But the way he handled it was wrong, but that's a separate issue. The initial question is about the anger, not the reaction. \n\nSo the answer is B.\n"
