We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 trying on clothes of the author's deceased wife, and the author's reaction. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's teacher and is now moving in. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet with the late wife's clothes. The author didn't want to clean it out and told his fianc\u00e9e she could use the space if there was room. \n\nThen the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without asking. The author was upset and said something that implied she was stretching the dress, which is a sensitive comment about her size. He apologized but it didn't help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are: the author's feelings about his late wife's belongings, the fianc\u00e9e's actions, and his response. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e might not have realized that the clothes were off-limits. Maybe she thought it was okay since the author told her to store her clothes there. But trying on someone else's clothes, especially of a deceased person, could be a boundary issue. The author is grieving and the clothes might be personal items that he hasn't dealt with yet. \n\nHowever, his reaction was harsh. The comment about her size was hurtful and out of line. Even if he was upset, lashing out like that can be seen as the author's mistake. The fianc\u00e9e was trying on clothes without permission, which the author didn't clarify earlier, but his response was excessive. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong for how he reacted, even if the fianc\u00e9e did something that upset him. The argument could be that the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, but the way he responded was inappropriate. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because of his harsh reaction, even though the situation is complicated.\n"
