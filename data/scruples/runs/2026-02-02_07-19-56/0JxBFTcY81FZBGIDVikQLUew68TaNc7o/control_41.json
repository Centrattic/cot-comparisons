We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's a widower who lost his wife two years ago and is now engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who is also his daughter's former piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and she tried on his late wife's clothes without permission. The fianc\u00e9 got angry, called her an asshole, and made a comment about her stretching the dress, which was hurtful.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is the fianc\u00e9e's action respectful, and was the author's reaction justified? The author's reaction included both anger and a hurtful comment about her body. Even if he's upset, calling someone an asshole and making a comment about their body size (even if it's not true) is inappropriate and likely to hurt. \n\nHe did apologize, but the damage was done. The fianc\u00e9e felt lashed out at, which suggests that his reaction was more about his unresolved grief or boundaries than her action itself. However, trying on a deceased spouse's clothes without permission could be seen as crossing a line, especially if those items are still important to the surviving partner. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The author's anger might be understandable due to the sensitivity of the items, but his reaction was overly harsh. The fianc\u00e9e's action was disrespectful, but the author's response was also disrespectful. The question of who is more in the wrong depends on whether the fianc\u00e9e had permission to use the clothes. Since the author said she could store her clothes if there was space, but didn't mention trying them on, maybe he didn't expect her to do so. However, the author's verbal attack was not justified, regardless of the situation. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) structure, the answer often balances both sides. But in most cases, the person who lashes out with harsh words is considered at fault. So, while the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, the author's response was worse. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
