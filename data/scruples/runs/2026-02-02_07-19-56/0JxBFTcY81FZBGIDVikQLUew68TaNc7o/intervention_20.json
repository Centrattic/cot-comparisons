We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a widower who's about to marry his fianc\u00e9e. She used to be his daughter's piano teacher, and they started dating a year after his wife's death two years ago. The situation in question is that the fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes without permission. The author got angry, called her an asshole, and made a comment about her stretching the dress, which he regretted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. The author is still grieving the loss of his wife, which is recent (two years ago) and the trauma of losing a spouse along with raising four kids alone. The closet with his wife's clothes is a personal space, and the fianc\u00e9e's action might have crossed a boundary he hadn't discussed. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the sensitivity of that space, especially since she was moving in and trying to integrate into the household.\n\nThe author's reaction included lashing out and a hurtful comment about the dress. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed it was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e was trying on clothes, which might be seen as invading his personal grief space. But he could have handled it with more empathy, explaining why it's important rather than lashing out. His immediate regret shows he realizes the insensitivity of his words, but the fact remains that he hurt her feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, both sides have valid points. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through his late wife's belongings without permission, which shows a lack of respect for his feelings. However, the author's response was harsh and hurtful, which is also wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad about her actions. Since he did lash out and use a harmful comment, even if his anger stemmed from grief, his reaction is part of the problem. The fianc\u00e9e might not have known the boundaries, but the author should have communicated them clearly instead of reacting angrily. So, considering both sides, the author is partially at fault for his harsh response, but the fianc\u00e9e also made a mistake. However, the question asks if the author is in the wrong, so the answer would be yes because his reaction was inappropriate, even if his feelings about the situation are valid.\n"
