We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. He has four kids and was dealing with grief and parenting alone. His fianc\u00e9e, who was previously his daughter's piano teacher, is moving in. The master bedroom's walk-in closet has his late wife's clothes, which he hasn't cleaned out. He told his fianc\u00e9e she could use the space if there's room. She ends up trying on the clothes, and he gets angry, even making a comment that comes off as implying she's fat, which upsets her.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission. The closet contains personal items of the deceased, which the author hasn't wanted to deal with yet. It's a sensitive space for him. His reaction, while harsh, might stem from grief and not wanting to see his late wife's belongings treated that way. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e was in the process of moving in and may not have understood the emotional significance could be a factor. She might have felt that since the author said she could store items there, maybe using the clothes was okay. But the author clearly stated \"without my permission,\" so that's a point against her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was inappropriate. He lashed out with a comment about her size, which is hurtful and not related to the actual issue. Even if he was upset, that remark was not justified and likely made the situation worse. He should have addressed the action without attacking her body. The question is whether his anger is valid or if he overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are consent and sensitivity. The author hadn't given permission for the clothes to be used, so from a boundary perspective, the fianc\u00e9e overstepped. However, the author's reaction was also unkind. The real issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action, but the author's response is part of the problem. \n\nConsidering the context: The author is still grieving, and the closet is a personal space. The fianc\u00e9e should have respected that and asked first. However, the author's harsh words made him come off as the one in the wrong. So, while he might not be entirely at fault for being upset, his reaction and the way he handled it definitely contributed to the problem. \n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the person who did the action (trying on the clothes without permission) is usually the one at fault. However, the author's mean comment exacerbated the situation. So the fianc\u00e9e is at fault for the initial action, but the author's response made him seem more wrong than he actually is. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The author's anger is somewhat justified because the fianc\u00e9e went into a private space with personal items and used them without permission. However, the way he expressed his anger was inappropriate. So depending on how much weight is given to his reaction versus the initial action, the answer might vary. \n\nIf the focus is on the fianc\u00e9e's action, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. But if the focus is on how he handled it, then he is. The question asks if he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. If being mad itself is the issue, then maybe not. But the way he expressed that anger is where he's in the wrong. However, the original question is whether he is in the wrong for being mad. So if the anger is justified, then he isn't in the wrong. But if his anger is misplaced, then he is. \n\nBut given that the fianc\u00e9e didn't have permission, the author's anger is understandable. However, the comment about her size was the real problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. If he's not at fault for being upset, but the way he expressed it is, then the answer would be B. But if the action of being mad is the issue, then A. \n\nI think the key is that the author's anger is not the main issue, but his harsh words and not handling it with more compassion. The fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a boundary, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but he's in the wrong for how he responded. However, the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. So the answer would be B (No), because the action she took was the problem, but his response was also wrong. However, the question is about the author's anger, not the harsh words. \n\nBut maybe the AITA community would consider the entire interaction. Since the author lashed out and made a hurtful comment, even if his initial anger is understandable, the overall situation might make him the one at fault. So in that case, he's in the wrong (A). \n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. I think the fianc\u00e9e is at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries, but the author's response was also wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. If his anger is justified, then no. But if his reaction is the problem, maybe not. The answer depends on whether the focus is on the action or the response. \n\nIn AITA posts, usually the person who broke the boundary is at fault. So the fianc\u00e9e is, but the author's harsh words also contributed. However, the main question is about the author's wrongdoing. The answer is likely B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the way he expressed it is. However, sometimes in AITA, even if the person is hurt, if they lash out, they become the AITA. \n\nAlternatively, the author's anger is justified, but the way he handled it was wrong. So the answer is A or B? \n\nI think the correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, the author's response was unkind and exacerbated the issue, making him the one at fault in the eyes of AITA readers. They often prioritize how the conflict was handled. So the answer is A.\n"
