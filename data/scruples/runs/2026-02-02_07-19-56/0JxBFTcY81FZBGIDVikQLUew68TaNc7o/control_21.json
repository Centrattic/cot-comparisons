We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, the context: The author lost his wife two years ago and is now engaged to someone who used to be his daughter's piano teacher. They're moving in together, and the fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from the deceased wife's closet. The author was upset, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress being stretched out, which was misinterpreted as a body-shaming remark. Now, they're both hurt and the fianc\u00e9e feels he lashed out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's wife died two years ago, and he's still emotional about it. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission. The author's reaction included an insensitive comment. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a cultural perspective, people often have strong feelings about their deceased partner's belongings. It's common for some items to be kept as a memory, and others might find it intrusive if someone else uses them. However, the author did mention that the fianc\u00e9e could store her clothes in the closet if there was space. He might have expected her to ask about the other items instead of just taking them out and trying them on. That could be seen as a boundary violation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's immediate reaction was to yell and make a hurtful comment. Even if he was upset, his response was inappropriate. He admitted that the comment about the dress was not the right thing to say. The fianc\u00e9e was trying to get to know the family by moving in, and perhaps she didn't realize the sensitivity of handling the late wife's clothes. However, the author's reaction escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides might have some fault. The fianc\u00e9e could have asked about the clothes instead of trying them on. The author could have communicated his feelings about the closet more clearly before the move-in. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His comment was definitely hurtful and unnecessary, which is a clear point against him. However, being upset about someone trying on his late wife's clothes might be considered a reasonable emotional response. But the way he expressed that anger was problematic.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is partially at fault for his harsh words, but the fianc\u00e9e also crossed a boundary. But since the question is specifically about the author's anger at her trying on the clothes, not the comment itself, maybe the answer depends on whether trying on the clothes without permission was wrong. If the author didn't give explicit permission, then the fianc\u00e9e overstepped. But the author's reaction was also inappropriate. The main issue is the author's right to be upset versus his handling of the situation.\n\nIn terms of the initial question, \"AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e...\" the key is whether his anger is justified. If the clothes were personal and not meant to be accessed, then he's not wrong to be upset. But the way he handled it was wrong. The question is about being mad, not about the comment. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his emotion is understandable, but he's at fault for the comment. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad...\" which is separate from his response. So if being mad is the focus, then the answer is B. But if the question includes his response, it's A. The user's question is specifically about being mad at her for trying on the clothes, not the comment. So the answer would be B. But the user might be conflating the two. The original question is about the author's anger, so the answer could be B, but in reality, both sides have issues. However, the fianc\u00e9e did overstep, so the author's anger is somewhat justified, but his reaction was not. The answer would be B (author not in the wrong for being mad) because the fianc\u00e9e did something he didn't like. But the comment made it worse. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. So the answer is B. But some might argue that even being mad is wrong because the clothes are part of the deceased wife's belongings, and the fianc\u00e9e had no right to try them on. So the author's anger is justified. Hence, answer B.\n"
