We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9e tried on the author's deceased wife's clothes without permission. The author got mad, told her to clean up, and used a hurtful comment about the dress being stretched out. Then the fianc\u00e9e was upset.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings about the clothes are important. The clothes belong to his deceased wife, so they're personal and might be a sensitive topic. He had mentioned the closet was still there with the clothes, but he hadn't cleaned it out. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space, but maybe he didn't specify that the other clothes should not be touched. So, maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't realize that trying on the clothes was off-limits. But the author's reaction was to lash out, which could be the problem.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset because those clothes are from his late wife, and trying them on might feel invasive or disrespectful. On the other hand, his response was harsh\u2014he called her an asshole and said something about her size, which was hurtful. Even if he was angry, his choice of words was inappropriate. He should have communicated his feelings without attacking her.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e might have felt that trying on the clothes wasn't a big deal, especially since the author had allowed her to use the closet. However, the author's grief and the personal nature of his wife's belongings are valid. The key point here is that while both parties have some responsibility\u2014maybe the author should have explained his feelings about the clothes earlier, and the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have tried them without asking\u2014the author's reaction was inconsiderate and hurtful. He should have handled it more respectfully.\n\nSo, the author is partially at fault for his harsh response, even if his feelings are valid. But the fianc\u00e9e also could have asked first. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer leans towards yes because his response was unkind and he didn't consider her feelings, even though he was upset. The initial anger and the specific comment about her size were definitely in the wrong.\n"
