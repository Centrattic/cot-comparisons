We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the fianc\u00e9e trying on the deceased wife's clothes. The author is a widower who's engaged again, and the fianc\u00e9e was their daughter's piano teacher. They're moving in together, and the fianc\u00e9e used the master bedroom closet where the author hasn't cleaned out his late wife's belongings.\n\nFirst, the author told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes if there's space, but didn't mention the personal items. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without asking, which led to the author's anger. He told her to clean up and made a comment about the dress stretching, which he later regretted. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and called him an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the emotional aspect: the author is still dealing with the loss of his wife, and those clothes are part of his personal memories and grief. The fianc\u00e9e, even though she was cleared to store her clothes, didn't ask about the existing items. She might not realize how sacred those items are to him. However, her action was out of curiosity or maybe wanting to use the space, but without permission.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction included a hurtful comment about her size, even if it wasn't intentional. He did apologize, but the damage was done. The question is whether his anger was justified. The fianc\u00e9e respected the kids and was a good fit, but invading personal space with sentimental items is a sensitive issue. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but his handling of the situation (the comment) made it worse. However, the main issue is whether trying on the clothes without permission was the fianc\u00e9e's mistake, which the author is upset about. The author's right to be upset is valid, but the way he expressed it was wrong. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the comment but not entirely for being angry. But the question is if he's in the wrong for being mad. The main wrong here is the fianc\u00e9e's action, but the author's reaction. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. If being mad is acceptable, then answer B, but if the author shouldn't have been mad, then A. But the author's anger is understandable, though his comment was wrong. The original question asks if the author is in the wrong for being mad. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission, maybe he's not in the wrong for being upset, but his comment was wrong. However, the question is about the anger itself. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had a right to be upset, but his reaction was inappropriate. The main question is about the anger, not the comment. So the answer is B. But some might argue that the author shouldn't have been angry because the fianc\u00e9e didn't know. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is B because the author's anger is justified, but his words were wrong. The AITA question is about the anger, not the comment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
