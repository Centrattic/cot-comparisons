We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. The author is a widower, engaged to a woman who was his daughter's piano teacher. They have four kids, and the fianc\u00e9e is moving in. The closet with the late wife's clothes is still there, and the fianc\u00e9e tried on some items, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's anger is understandable. The clothes belong to someone he loved and lost, so there's emotional value there. It's a sensitive area, and not everyone would feel the same, but his reaction is rooted in grief and personal space. However, the way he expressed his anger was problematic. He called out her size when that wasn't the real issue. Even if he didn't mean to insult her, the comment was hurtful. Apologizing is good, but the initial response caused pain.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional impact of her actions. She was given permission to use the closet, but maybe she didn't consider that the clothes were off-limits. Her trying on the clothes without asking could be seen as crossing a boundary, but her reaction to his outburst was to feel hurt, which is valid because his words were harsh.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Partly. He had a right to be upset about the clothes, but his response was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e also didn't ask before trying them on, which could be a mistake. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his comment about her size was the main issue, even if he apologized. His anger was justified, but the way he handled it caused harm.\n"
