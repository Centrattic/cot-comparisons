We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9e trying on the deceased wife's clothes, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a widower with four kids, engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who is also their piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e tried on his late wife's clothes without permission. The author got angry, called her an asshole, and made a comment about stretching the dress. Then apologized, but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's still grieving. The clothes are personal items from his late wife, which he hasn't dealt with yet. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could use the closet space, but didn't mention the clothes. She took it upon herself to try them on, which he found disrespectful or intrusive. His anger might stem from not being ready to let go of his wife's belongings or feeling that the fianc\u00e9e overstepped boundaries.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side: she's trying to move in, maybe not fully aware of the emotional sensitivity around the clothes. She might have thought trying on the clothes wasn't a big deal, especially if she assumed they were just being stored. But the author's reaction was harsh, especially the comment about the dress size, which could be seen as body-shaming. Even if it wasn't intentional, the words hurt her.\n\nNow, considering cultural and emotional contexts. Grief is a personal process. The author hasn't cleaned out the closet, so the clothes are still in a sacred space for him. The fianc\u00e9e's action might have crossed a line by respecting his grieving process. However, the author's response was lashing out, which is unkind. He should have communicated his feelings without attacking her.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both have some fault. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have tried on the clothes without asking, especially knowing the emotional weight. But the author's response was disproportionate and hurtful. He should have explained how he felt instead of making a derogatory comment. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's actions. The author is not entirely in the wrong because he has the right to set boundaries around his late wife's belongings. But his reaction was flawed.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he could have handled it better. The core problem is the fianc\u00e9e's actions, but the author's response was also inappropriate. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, the answer leans towards B because the fianc\u00e9e's actions were the main issue. The author's anger is understandable, but his method of expressing it was wrong. However, the main fault lies with the fianc\u00e9e for not respecting his boundaries first. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but his approach was wrong, but the question is about being in the wrong for being mad. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a boundary, the author's anger is justified, but his expression of it was not. The answer might be A or B here. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is \"AITA for being mad at my fianc\u00e9e...\" So he's asking if he's the asshole for being mad. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, but his reaction was also wrong. However, in the context of the question, the main issue is whether his anger is justified. Since the fianc\u00e9e crossed a line, his anger is understandable, but his response (calling her an asshole and making a comment about her size) was inappropriate. So he is partially wrong in how he handled it, but not entirely. So maybe the answer is B because the main fault is the fianc\u00e9e, but he's not completely right. However, in AITA scenarios, if the person's reaction is out of line, they might be considered the asshole. The comment about stretching the dress is clearly a mistake, which he admits. So even though the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, his response was also wrong. So the answer might be A. But the original question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, not for his reaction. Being mad is justified, but how he expressed it was wrong. So technically, he's not in the wrong for being mad, but his actions were. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad...\" So the focus is on his anger, not his reaction. In that case, being mad is not wrong. So the answer would be B. Because the fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a boundary, so he's not in the wrong for being angry. However, his way of expressing it was wrong. But the question is about being angry, not about his response. So the answer is B.\n"
