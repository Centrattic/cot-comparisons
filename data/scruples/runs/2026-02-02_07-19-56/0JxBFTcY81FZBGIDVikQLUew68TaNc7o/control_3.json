We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lost his wife two years ago and they have four kids. His fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and there's a walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings. He didn't clean it out yet. He told her she could store some clothes there. But when he found her trying on his ex-wife's clothes, he got angry and made a comment about the dress being stretched, which hurt her feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries with the deceased's belongings. The author is still grieving, and those clothes are personal items from his late wife. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight those items carry. Even if she thought she was just using the space, she didn't consider that accessing and trying on the clothes could be disrespectful to him, especially during the grieving process.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did lash out and made a comment that came off as body-shaming, which was clearly hurtful. While his anger might stem from unresolved grief, his reaction was inappropriate. He should have communicated his feelings about the clothes being off-limits earlier, rather than letting it escalate to this point. \n\nBut was he wrong for being angry? Maybe not entirely. The fianc\u00e9e did cross a boundary by trying on the clothes without his okay. However, his response (calling her an asshole and making a hurtful comment) is definitely in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry or for his reaction. The key here is whether his anger was justified. Since the fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary, his anger isn't entirely unfounded, but how he expressed it was wrong. The title of the question is about being angry, not the response. However, the response is part of the situation. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad. The answer might hinge on whether his anger is justified. But in most cases, even if someone crosses a boundary, the way they respond matters. The author's anger is somewhat understandable, but his handling of it is not. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. If the fianc\u00e9e did something that violated a boundary, then his anger is justified. However, the fianc\u00e9e might not have known that the clothes were off-limits. The author didn't clearly communicate that, so maybe he's partially responsible for not setting boundaries. \n\nSo, the author's anger might be justified because he didn't want the clothes touched, but he didn't communicate that. The fianc\u00e9e's action was inappropriate, but the author's response was worse. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then it's because he overreacted. If B (no), then it's because he had a right to be upset. \n\nIn these situations, usually, the person who is grieving and has personal items that shouldn't be disturbed isn't wrong for being upset. The fianc\u00e9e should have respected the space. However, the author's reaction was poor. But the initial anger is about the action, not the response. The title is about being mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on clothes. So the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes) because even though he had a reason to be upset, his response was the main issue. But maybe the community would see it as B because the fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a line. However, the author didn't communicate the boundaries, so he's partially responsible. But the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn many AITA threads, if someone crosses a boundary without being clear, the person who set the boundary (even implicitly) isn't wrong for being upset. However, the way they reacted can still be problematic. So the author's anger is justified, but his response was in the wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. If the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, then he's not in the wrong for being angry. But if the fianc\u00e9e didn't know, then maybe he should have communicated better. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (no), because the fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary violation, so his anger isn't wrong. However, the way he expressed it was wrong. But the question is about being angry, not the response. So the answer is B (no), he's not in the wrong for being angry. However, the answer could be A if the focus is on the response. But the question is specifically about the anger, not the reaction. So I need to choose between A and B based on the anger itself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fianc\u00e9e's action is wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
