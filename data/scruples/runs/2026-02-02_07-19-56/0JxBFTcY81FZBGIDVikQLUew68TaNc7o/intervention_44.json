We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 trying on the clothes of his deceased wife, and the fianc\u00e9e doing that without permission.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who's moving on with a new partner. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's teacher, and they're getting married. The key issue here is that the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes of the deceased wife, which the author found upsetting. He got angry and made a comment about the size, which he later regretted.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if he's at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel that his late wife's belongings are private and shouldn't be disturbed. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without asking, which could be seen as a boundary violation. However, the author's response was harsh, especially the comment about the dress stretching, which might have been hurtful and inappropriate, even if it wasn't intended.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes. The fianc\u00e9e did act without permission, so the author's anger might be justified as a reaction to that boundary being crossed. However, the way he expressed his anger (the comment about the dress) was unkind and hurtful. So while the initial anger might be understandable, the way he handled it was wrong.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The user said they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate if the author's anger is justified. The fianc\u00e9e did touch personal items of the deceased, which could be a sensitive issue. So the author's feelings are valid. However, the way he reacted is problematic. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" for being mad, not about how he handled it. If the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have done that, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, the user might think the author overreacted, but the answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong.\n\nSo, the author's anger is a reaction to a boundary violation. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through the clothes without permission. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action, and the author's handling of it was poor, but the anger itself is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
