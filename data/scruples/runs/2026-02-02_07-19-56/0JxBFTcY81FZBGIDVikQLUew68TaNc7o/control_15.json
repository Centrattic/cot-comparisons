We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. He's engaged to his girlfriend, who is his daughter's former piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from his late wife's closet, which he hadn't cleared out yet. He got angry and said something about her stretching the dress, which he later realized was about their different body types. She was hurt and called him an asshole.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are emotional boundaries and respect for personal items of the deceased. The author's late wife's clothes are personal items, and even though they're not being used, they hold emotional value. The fianc\u00e9e tried them on without permission, which the author found upsetting. However, the author's response included a comment that could be interpreted as implying she was fat, even if it wasn't intentional. That part is definitely hurtful and inconsiderate.\n\nBut the main issue is why he's upset. Grief is a factor here. Losing a spouse and then having the new partner interact with personal effects can be triggering. The author's reaction might be justified due to his emotional state. However, his response was inappropriate. He shouldn't have made a comment about her body size. But the core of his anger was about her trying on the clothes without asking. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the sensitivity of those clothes. She was moving in and perhaps saw the closet as shared space. But the author had a right to set boundaries. The fact that he had told her she could store clothes there but didn't mention the late wife's items suggests there was an unspoken boundary. She crossed it, and his reaction, while poorly worded, was about respecting that boundary.\n\nHowever, the way he expressed his anger was wrong. The comment about the dress was unkind and contributed to her hurt feelings. So while his feelings are valid, his delivery was not. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a boundary issue, but the author's response exacerbated the situation. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, both have some responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have tried on the clothes without asking, and the author shouldn't have made a hurtful comment. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did lash out inappropriately, even though his initial anger was about a boundary, he's partially at fault. However, the main wrong might be on the fianc\u00e9e for crossing a boundary. But the way he handled it made things worse. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong entirely but did contribute to the problem. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. If the answer is about whether he's in the wrong for being angry at her, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his anger stems from grief and boundary issues. But his response was wrong. The question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad...\" So the focus is on his anger. If his anger is justified, then he's not in the wrong. If his anger is misplaced, then he is. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a breach of his space, so his anger is somewhat valid. But the way he expressed it was wrong. However, the initial question is whether he is in the wrong for being angry. Since his anger is a reaction to her crossing a boundary, he's not in the wrong. But his response was inconsiderate. The answer might be B, but with the note that his delivery was wrong. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not about his response. The core of the question is about his anger. If he's justified in being angry about her trying on the clothes, then the answer is B. If not, A. Since the clothes are personal and he didn't want them touched, her action was a violation, so his anger is justified. The answer is B.\n"
