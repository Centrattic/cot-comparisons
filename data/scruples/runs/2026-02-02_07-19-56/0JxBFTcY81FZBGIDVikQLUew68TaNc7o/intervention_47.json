We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes from his deceased wife without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lost his wife two years ago and is still dealing with that loss. The fianc\u00e9e used to be their eldest daughter's piano teacher, so there's a prior relationship with the family. They've been engaged for two weeks, and she's moving in. The walk-in closet has the deceased wife's clothes, which the author hasn't dealt with yet. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if space allowed. She tried on a dress, and he got angry, said some hurtful words, then apologized but she was still upset.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He's mad about her trying on his late wife's clothes without asking, but he also realizes his comment about the dress was inappropriate. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry at her action.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is grieving, and having someone try on his late wife's belongings without consent might be a trigger. He has a right to be upset about his personal items being disturbed. On the other hand, he did make a hurtful comment that could be seen as body-shaming, even if unintentional. Also, the fianc\u00e9e might not have understood the sensitivity around his late wife's belongings. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from grief and the fact that the clothes haven't been processed yet. However, he should have communicated his feelings about the closet beforehand. He gave permission for her to store clothes there, but maybe didn't set clear boundaries about the late wife's belongings. His reaction was harsh, especially the comment about the dress, which could be taken as a personal attack. The fianc\u00e9e likely felt disrespected and hurt, which is valid.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to be angry about the clothes being tried on? It depends on how he communicated his boundaries. If he didn't specify that the clothes should not be touched, then he can't blame her for not knowing. However, since it's a sensitive area for him, he should have been clear. The comment about the dress was definitely inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have missteps. The author didn't set boundaries, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask before trying on clothes. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's reaction, especially the hurtful comment. Even if he was upset, that comment was inappropriate and part of his responsibility. However, his underlying feelings about the clothes might be valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset about someone trying on his late wife's clothes without permission, but his reaction was definitely part of the problem. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at the action itself. If the clothes were personal and he hadn't addressed it before, maybe he's not wrong. But the main issue is how he expressed his anger. The answer might hinge on whether the fianc\u00e9e had permission and the author's communication. Since he didn't clarify the boundaries and she was moving in, perhaps he is partially at fault. But given the context, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the comment was hurtful and he didn't set clear boundaries, leading to the conflict.\n"
