We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being upset because his fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from his deceased wife without permission.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who's still grieving. His wife died two years ago, which isn't that long ago, and he's now engaged to someone new. The fianc\u00e9e was previously the piano teacher for his kids, so there's a history there. The key issue is the fianc\u00e9e going through the walk-in closet where the author hasn't cleaned out his late wife's belongings.\n\nThe author allowed the fianc\u00e9e to store her clothes in the closet, but she went further by trying on his wife's clothes. The author was angry and said something about her stretching the dress, which implied she was fat, even if that wasn't the intention. He later apologized, but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes without permission, which the author found upsetting. The author's reaction was harsh, especially the comment about stretching the dress. However, the author was grieving and in a vulnerable state. The fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped by going into personal items of his late wife. But the author's response was also inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author's anger is justified. Some might say that the fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by trying on clothes that were personal and tied to his deceased wife. Others might argue that the author's reaction was too harsh and that he should have communicated his feelings better before getting angry. The author's comment about her size was definitely hurtful, but the core issue is the action of trying on the clothes.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e might need to understand the sensitivity of the situation, but the author could have handled it more respectfully. The author's initial anger and the hurtful comment make it likely that he's partially at fault. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action was also a breach of boundaries. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at both sides. The author's comment was a misstep, but the fianc\u00e9e's action was also problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his reaction was justified. Given that he did lash out with a hurtful comment, he's likely in the wrong, even if his feelings are valid. So, the answer is A.\n"
