We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. His fianc\u00e9e is his ex-piano teacher, now moving in with him. The walk-in closet still has his late wife's clothes. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her own clothes there if space allowed. Then she tried on the late wife's clothes, leading to an argument. The author got angry, said something about her stretching the dress (implying she's bigger than the late wife), which hurt her feelings. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's anger: is that justified? The clothes belong to his deceased wife. Even though they're not being used, they might have sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9e tried them on without permission. That's a boundary issue. The author had told her to store her own clothes there if there was space, but didn't mention not to touch the late wife's things. So maybe he should have been clearer. But the fianc\u00e9e went ahead and tried them on, which the author found offensive. His reaction, though, included an insensitive comment about her size, even if it wasn't intentional. That's a big problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by not respecting his wish to keep his late wife's clothes private. On the other, the author's response was harsh and hurtful. The key points are about boundaries and communication. The author might not be entirely wrong in being upset, but his reaction, especially the comment about her stretching the dress, was inappropriate. He should have expressed his feelings without attacking her. The fianc\u00e9e also could have asked instead of assuming she could try them on. But the author's part is more about how he handled it. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because his response was hurtful and he should have communicated better. But some might argue that the fianc\u00e9e was also wrong. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. The answer hinges on his reaction. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, and the comment was the key issue, the answer is A.\n"
