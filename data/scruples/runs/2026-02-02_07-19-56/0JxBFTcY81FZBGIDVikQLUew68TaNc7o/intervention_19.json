We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being mad at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on the deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a widower who's engaged to a woman who used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher. They're moving in together, and in the master bedroom, there's a walk-in closet with the late wife's belongings. The fianc\u00e9e tried on some of these clothes without permission, and the author got upset, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's fianc\u00e9e was trying on clothes that belong to his deceased wife. The author feels violated or disrespected. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, might not have realized the emotional weight of the act. She said \"no harm in it,\" which could indicate she didn't consider the author's feelings.\n\nThe author's reaction included a hurtful comment about the dress stretching because his late wife was a different size. He immediately regretted it, but the damage was done. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and accused him of lashing out. \n\nNow, considering emotions and boundaries: The author's late wife's clothes are personal items. Having a fianc\u00e9e try them on without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author has a right to be upset about his late wife's belongings being handled without permission. However, the way he expressed his anger (calling her fat, even inadvertently) was inappropriate. \n\nBut the main question is about the author being in the wrong. The initial action of the fianc\u00e9e was probably a mistake, not malicious. The author's anger is understandable given the context, but his choice of words was hurtful. However, the core issue is whether he was wrong to be angry about her trying on the clothes. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e moving in and not respecting that boundary might be at fault. The author's reaction was harsh, but the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's response was also unkind. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of responsibilities, the author might have needed to set clearer boundaries about the late wife's belongings before the move-in. The fianc\u00e9e could have asked first. But the author's angry outburst, especially with the comment about the dress, definitely made things worse. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the question is whether the author was wrong to be angry about the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes, maybe not entirely. But he's definitely in the wrong for how he expressed his anger. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the situation as a whole. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the fianc\u00e9e overstepped and the author's reaction. The author's anger is justified in part, but his method was wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author had the right to be upset about the belongings being handled without permission, but the way he reacted was harmful, so maybe he's partially at fault. However, the core issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the fianc\u00e9e also made a mistake. However, according to the options, the user wants a strict A or B. If the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry, then maybe B (not in the wrong), but if it's about the whole situation including the harsh words, then A. The original question is about the author being wrong for being mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. The author's anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it was wrong. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. \n\nIn the end, the author's anger is a reaction to a boundary violation, so perhaps he's not in the wrong for being upset, but his response was wrong. The question is whether he is in the wrong for being mad. If the user is asking if he's in the wrong for being angry, maybe not. But if the question is about the entire situation, then perhaps A. But the way the question is phrased: \"AITA for being mad...\" So, the answer is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The fianc\u00e9e did something that violated his emotional space, so he's not in the wrong for being mad. However, the way he expressed it is wrong. But the question is about being mad, not about the harsh words. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong for being angry), but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user says \"I think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\" The user is the fianc\u00e9e in the scenario? No, the user is asking about the original poster. The original poster is the one who wrote the situation, and the user is asking if they are in the wrong. The original question is from the fianc\u00e9e's perspective? No, the original scenario is from the author's point of view (the widower). The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo the author (the widower) is the one who is angry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user is asking for my opinion. \n\nIf I think the author is not in the wrong for being angry, then answer B. If I think he is in the wrong for being angry, then A. \n\nThe author's anger stems from his fianc\u00e9e handling personal items of his late wife without permission. That's a boundary violation. So he's not wrong to be upset. However, his reaction was inappropriate. But the question is specifically about being mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. So the anger is justified in part. The answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, and the author has a right to be upset. But the way he handled it is separate. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, not for how he expressed it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
