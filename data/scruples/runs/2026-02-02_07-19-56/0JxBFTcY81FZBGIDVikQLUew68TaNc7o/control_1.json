We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 36-year-old widower who's engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who's 24. He's been dealing with the loss of his first wife two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's piano teacher, and they've been dating for a year. Now, she's moving in, and she tried on his deceased wife's clothes without permission. He got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress being stretched out because of her size. She felt hurt, and they're in a conflict.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying on the clothes. The author's wife's belongings are personal and might hold emotional significance. The author didn't give permission for her to go through those items, so her action could be seen as invasive. However, the author's reaction might be too harsh, especially the comment about the dress stretching out implying she's fat. That part was definitely hurtful and not okay, even if he later apologized.\n\nThe author's anger comes from a place of grief and perhaps not being ready to deal with his late wife's belongings. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight of those clothes. But the way he lashed out was inappropriate. He should have addressed the situation calmly, explaining why the clothes are a sensitive topic instead of making a hurtful comment. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e should have respected the author's unspoken boundaries. Even if she meant no harm, trying on someone else's clothing, especially of a deceased person, is a privacy issue. The author has a right to be upset about that. But his reaction, while understandable in terms of emotional distress, crossed a line with the size comment. So the blame isn't entirely on one side. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, both have some responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through the clothes without permission, but the author's response was overly aggressive. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about the clothes. Since the clothes are part of his late wife's personal effects and he hadn't dealt with them, his anger is somewhat justified. However, the way he handled it made things worse. The question is if he's in the wrong overall. \n\nThe answer would be that he's partially at fault for his harsh comment but not entirely for being angry. However, the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong for being mad at the fianc\u00e9e for trying on the clothes. Since his anger stems from valid emotional reasons (grief, personal space), maybe he isn't entirely in the wrong. But the comment was definitely wrong. The system requires choosing between A or B. \n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Since the author's reaction included a harmful comment, but his anger is partly understandable, it's a gray area. However, the primary issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The author's anger is a reaction to a boundary being crossed. So technically, he's not in the wrong for being angry, but his response was wrong. The question is whether being angry makes him in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his anger is a reaction to her overstepping, but the comment was his fault. The system might require choosing A or B. Since the main question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes, the answer is B. But the comment part complicates it. However, the question is about being mad, not the comment. So B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
