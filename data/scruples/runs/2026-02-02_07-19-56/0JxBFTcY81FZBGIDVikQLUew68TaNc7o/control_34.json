We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who has been through a lot\u2014his wife died two years ago, and he's been a single dad to four kids. His fianc\u00e9e, who was previously his daughter's piano teacher, is moving in. The fianc\u00e9e tried on his late wife's clothes without permission. The author got angry, said she was stretching the dress, and then regretted it. The fianc\u00e9e was hurt and called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the clothes belong to the author's late wife, so they're a sensitive subject. The fianc\u00e9e did enter the closet without permission, which might be a privacy issue. The author's emotional reaction is understandable given the context\u2014his pain from losing his wife. However, the way he reacted, especially the comment about the size, might have been hurtful and inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The fianc\u00e9e did something that was a boundary violation, but the author's response was harsh. He didn't just express his anger but made a comment about her body, which is a sensitive topic. Even if it was a slip of the tongue, it caused harm. The key here is that while the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, the author's reaction was also wrong in terms of how he handled it. \n\nSo, even if both are partially at fault, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer is A (Yes), because he lashed out inappropriately. But wait, the user might think the fianc\u00e9e is wrong for entering the closet. However, the question is about the author's actions. The author's words were hurtful and crossed a line, even if he was upset. So the answer is A.\n"
