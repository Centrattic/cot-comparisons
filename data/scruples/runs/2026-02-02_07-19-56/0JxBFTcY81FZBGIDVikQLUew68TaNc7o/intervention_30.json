We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a man who's engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, but he's also a widower with a deceased wife. The fianc\u00e9e was his daughter's piano teacher, and they've been dating for a year. Now, when moving in together, the fianc\u00e9e tried on his late wife's clothes without his permission. The user got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about her stretching the dress, which he later regretted. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission. That's a red flag for the user because those items are personal and tied to his late wife. He might feel that her actions are disrespectful or an invasion of privacy. However, his reaction was to lash out, making a comment about her body size, which is hurtful. Even if he later apologized, the immediate reaction was inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive the situation was. She might have thought it was okay since the clothes were in the closet and she was moving in. But she should have communicated first. The user's grief is still fresh (2 years), and dealing with his wife's belongings is a personal matter. \n\nSo, both have some responsibility. The user shouldn't have yelled and made a derogatory comment, which is definitely his fault. But the fianc\u00e9e should have asked before trying on the clothes. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. His anger was justified in part, but his method of expressing it was not. So maybe the answer is a mix, but according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the user's reaction was hurtful and he admitted it was wrong, but his initial anger might be understandable. But in terms of right and wrong, his reaction is definitely part of the problem. So the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because his response was inappropriate even if the fianc\u00e9e made a mistake. However, some might argue both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the user's actions. Since he lashed out, even if he had a reason, he's in the wrong for how he handled it.\n"
