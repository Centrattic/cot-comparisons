We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 36-year-old man who's engaged to his 24-year-old fianc\u00e9e. He's a widower with four kids, and his first wife died two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher and they started dating a year ago. They're now moving in together, and she tried on his deceased wife's clothes without his permission.\n\nHe found her trying on the clothes and got angry, even though he later realized his words might have been hurtful. The key points here are about boundaries, grief, and respect. The fianc\u00e9e might not have understood the emotional weight of the situation. She was trying to unpack and organize, but using the walk-in closet which had the late wife's belongings was probably a mistake.\n\nHe told her she could store her clothes there if there was space, but that doesn't mean she should have gone through the clothes. The act of trying on the clothes, especially without permission, could be seen as intrusive. He was in a sensitive emotional state, and her actions might have crossed a boundary. However, his reaction of calling her an asshole and lashing out was also problematic. He hurt her feelings, which complicates things.\n\nBut the core issue is whether she overstepped. The author is upset because she tried on his late wife's clothes, which is a personal space and items that are still significant to him. The fianc\u00e9e might have thought it was okay because she's moving in and they're engaged, but not everyone would consider that appropriate without explicit consent. \n\nHe mentioned he hasn't cleaned out the closet yet, so he still has a connection to his late wife. The fact that she went through the clothes and tried them on without asking suggests she didn't respect his boundaries. However, his response was harsh. So both parties have some fault, but the main question is who is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were disrespectful, but his reaction was also inappropriate. \n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for being mad. Since she did something that he found disrespectful, he's not entirely wrong. But his reaction was also wrong. However, the primary issue is her actions. So maybe he's not in the wrong for being angry, but he did handle it poorly. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because her actions were the main issue, even though his response was wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. Since her actions were disrespectful, he's not in the wrong for being upset. So the answer is B.\n"
