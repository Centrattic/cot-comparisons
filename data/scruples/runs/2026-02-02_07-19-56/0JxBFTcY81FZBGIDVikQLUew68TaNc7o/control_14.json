We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a widower with four kids, and he's now engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who used to be his eldest daughter's piano teacher. They've been dating a year and engaged two weeks. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and in the master bedroom, there's a walk-in closet with his late wife's clothes. He hasn't cleaned it out yet. He told her she could put her clothes there if there was space.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e tried on a dress from his late wife. The author found her and was upset, told her to clean up, and in a moment of anger, said something about the dress being stretched because his late wife was taller and a different size. The fianc\u00e9e took that as an insult, got hurt, and now they're arguing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the fianc\u00e9e went into the closet without permission (assuming she didn't ask explicitly if she could try on the clothes), tried on items personal to his late wife, and the author's reaction included a comment that could be interpreted as fat-shaming even if unintended. \n\nThe author is upset because the clothes are a personal and sensitive area. The closet with his late wife's belongings is a space that might still be off-limits for him, especially two years after her death. The fianc\u00e9e entering and trying on clothes could be seen as trespassing on his grief. However, the author's response of calling her fat, even if he meant the dress was stretched, might have been a harsh reaction that hurt her feelings.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional impact of trying on the clothes without his explicit permission. But the author's initial anger and the specific comment that led to her crying is a problem. Even if he was justified in being upset about the clothes, the way he expressed it was harmful. He apologized, but the damage was done.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the fianc\u00e9e made a mistake by trying on the clothes without permission, but the author's reaction was inappropriate. The question is who is more in the wrong. The title asks if the author is in the wrong for being mad. The answer might be that the author is not entirely wrong for being upset, but his reaction was inconsiderate. However, the fianc\u00e9e also crossed a line. But since the question is about the author's anger, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong for being mad, but his method was wrong. However, the standard in these AITA situations often looks at who is more at fault. The author's comment was a direct attack on the fianc\u00e9e, which is worse than her trying the clothes. So maybe the author is in the wrong for how he responded, even if his initial anger is understandable.\n"
