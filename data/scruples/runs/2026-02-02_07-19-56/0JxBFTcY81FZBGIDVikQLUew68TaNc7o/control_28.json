We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 36-year-old man who's engaged to his 24-year-old girlfriend after being a widower for two years. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the context: He's a single dad with four kids, and the fianc\u00e9e was his daughter's piano teacher. They started dating a year ago, and she's moving in. The walk-in closet still has his late wife's belongings, which he hasn't cleaned out. He told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if space allowed.\n\nShe tried on a dress without permission, and he got angry, saying she was stretching it out, which implied she was fat. He immediately regretted it and apologized. The fianc\u00e9e is hurt, calling him an asshole. The user is conflicted between his justified anger over the clothes and the harsh comment.\n\nNow, to analyze. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e may not have realized the emotional sensitivity of his late wife's belongings. Entering the closet and trying on clothes could be seen as a privacy issue or an invasion of his grief space. His reaction, while perhaps overly harsh, might stem from a place of emotional pain and not wanting to disturb his late wife's memory. \n\nOn the other hand, his comment about her stretching the dress was a direct body-related insult, even if it was a slip. That's a clear example of lashing out inappropriately. However, the core issue is her using the clothes without permission. The user might be in the wrong for not setting clear boundaries earlier, especially with such a sensitive area. If he knew the closet had personal items and hadn't cleared it out, he should have communicated that it's off-limits or established rules for storage. The fianc\u00e9e might have thought it was okay to use the space if there was room, but assuming access to a deceased spouse's belongings could be a mistake. \n\nBut the user's anger led to an offensive remark, which is definitely wrong. Even if the main issue is the unauthorized use of the clothes, the way he expressed his anger was harmful. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings were hurt, and his apology might not have been sufficient. So, while both parties might have missteps, the user's comment was a significant error. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at the action itself. \n\nIf he had expressed his anger without the body-shaming comment, maybe it's a different scenario. But the way he reacted, including the hurtful remark, makes him at least partially at fault. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's lack of awareness about the sensitivity could be a problem. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he lashed out and the underlying issue of not setting boundaries. But some might argue that his grief justifies the anger, making it B. However, the comment about her size is a red line, so A is more likely.\n"
