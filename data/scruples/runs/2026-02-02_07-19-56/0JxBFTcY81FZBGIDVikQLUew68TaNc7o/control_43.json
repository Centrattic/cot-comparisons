We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 36-year-old man who is engaged to a 24-year-old woman. He was previously married for 11 years before his wife died two years ago. They had four kids, and he was a single dad. Now, his fianc\u00e9e, who used to be their piano teacher, is moving in with him. The issue is about her trying on clothes from his late wife in their shared closet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspects. The man is still grieving, and the clothes are a personal and sensitive area. The fianc\u00e9e was in the master bedroom unpacking, which is a shared space now. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space, but he didn't mention the late wife's belongings. She went into the closet and tried on items without asking. The man was upset and lashed out, even if he later regretted it.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission before trying on the clothes. The man had not cleared out the closet, but he also didn't explicitly say she couldn't touch those items. However, given the emotional weight of the situation, it's reasonable for him to feel that those clothes are off-limits unless discussed. His reaction was inappropriate in the way he insulted her, but the initial anger about the boundary being crossed might be justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions were a breach of unspoken boundaries. The man's anger stems from the emotional sensitivity around his late wife's belongings. However, how he expressed that anger (calling her out and making a comment about her size) was hurtful. So, while his feelings are valid, his handling of the situation was wrong. But the question is whether he is in the wrong for being mad at her action. If the fianc\u00e9e overstepped, then he's not entirely to blame. However, his response was inappropriate. The answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong, and the man's reaction was partially justified but poorly handled.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often respect the belongings of deceased partners. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked. The man's anger is understandable, but his harsh words were not. So, the man is partially wrong for his response but not entirely wrong for the initial anger. The answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction was hurtful and crossed the line, even if the situation is complex. Alternatively, maybe B (No) because the fianc\u00e9e was out of line. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that he lashed out and said hurtful things, which makes him at least partly wrong. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action was the root of the problem. The answer might be B (No) because the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, but the man's response was the problem. Wait, the question is if he's in the wrong for being mad at her trying on the clothes. If the fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong, then the man isn't wrong for being upset. But his response was wrong. So, he's not wrong for being angry, but his actions were inappropriate. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry, not for his reaction. The answer is B (No) because the fianc\u00e9e was in the wrong for trying on the clothes without permission. The man's anger is justified, even if his reaction was poor. The question is specifically about being mad at her action, not the way he expressed it. So the answer is B.\n"
