We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. His fianc\u00e9e is his ex-piano teacher, and they have kids together. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from the author's late wife's closet. The author got upset and said something about the dress stretching, which the fianc\u00e9e took as a comment on her size. He apologized but she was hurt.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and sensitivity. The author had told the fianc\u00e9e she could use the closet if there was space, but he hadn't intended for her to try on the clothes. The act of trying on a deceased person's clothing might be a boundary issue for the author. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her an asshole and making a comment about her size\u2014seems harsh and hurtful. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed his anger led to her feeling belittled. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped by trying on the clothes without permission, especially knowing they were the late wife's. The author's anger is somewhat understandable given the context, but his reaction was inappropriate. The comment about the dress stretching, knowing the size difference, could be seen as a personal attack, which escalated the situation. \n\nSo, while both parties might have made mistakes, the primary issue is the author's inappropriate response. His anger is valid, but the way he communicated it was disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
