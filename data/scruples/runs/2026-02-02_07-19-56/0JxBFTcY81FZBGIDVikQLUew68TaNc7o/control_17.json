We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit sensitive because it involves a deceased wife's belongings and a new fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower and still processing his wife's death. He hasn't cleaned out her closet, which probably makes the space still sacred or personal to him. His fianc\u00e9e tried on his late wife's clothes without permission. That seems like a boundary issue. He told her she could store her own clothes in the closet if there was space, but he didn't mention her being allowed to use the clothes. So, maybe she overstepped by trying them on. The author was upset and lashed out, which isn't great, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nHe said something about her stretching the dress, which could be interpreted as a body-shaming comment. He immediately regretted it and apologized, but the fianc\u00e9e felt hurt. So, while the initial anger might be understandable, the way he expressed it was hurtful. \n\nNow, the key points: the fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes without asking, which the author found offensive. But the author's response was inappropriate. So, who's more at fault? The author might not be entirely wrong because she did cross a boundary, but his harsh reaction is part of the problem. However, the question is asking if he's in the wrong. Since he did hurt her feelings with his words, even if provoked, he shares some responsibility. Maybe both are partially wrong, but according to the AITA format, sometimes the answer is B (not in the wrong) if his actions were justified. But given that the comment about her size was hurtful, even if unintended, maybe the answer is A. Hmm. Alternatively, the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have tried the clothes, so the author is not in the wrong for being angry, but his response was bad. The question is whether he is in the wrong overall. Since he expressed his anger in a harmful way, maybe A. But if the main issue is her action, then B. It's a bit tricky. I think the main wrongdoer is the fianc\u00e9e, but the author's response is also problematic. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then he is. If B, then not. Since the author was angry at her for a boundary violation but reacted poorly, maybe he's not the one in the wrong because the initial action was hers. So B.\n"
