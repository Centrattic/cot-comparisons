We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9e trying on the author's deceased wife's clothes, and the author being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a widower who's been through a lot, dealing with loss and raising kids. His fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and there's a shared bedroom with the deceased wife's clothes. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, and the author reacted angrily, even saying something he later regretted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the clothes belong to his late wife, and the author might feel that these are sacred or private items. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask for permission, which could be a breach of the author's boundaries. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding personal items of his deceased spouse. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight of those clothes. She could have thought it was okay since the author mentioned the closet as a storage space. However, the fact that she went into the walk-in closet and tried on clothes without asking is a key point here. The author was in a vulnerable position, still grieving, and the action of trying on the clothes might have been insensitive.\n\nThe author's reaction included a hurtful comment about the dress stretching, which he regretted. That part is definitely on him for being insensitive. However, his initial anger stems from the action itself\u2014trying on clothes that are deeply personal and tied to his late wife. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's intention might have been innocent, but the act of using someone else's intimate items, especially of a deceased person, can be seen as crossing a line. The author's right to control access to his late wife's belongings is important here. \n\nBut also, the author could have approached the situation with more understanding. Maybe he should have communicated clearly about the boundaries earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action was the direct cause. The author's outburst, though, was a poor way to handle it. So there's some fault on both sides, but the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action without permission. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by using the clothes without asking. However, the author's reaction was inappropriate. It's a bit of a gray area, but the core issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but he did handle it poorly. So the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that his response could have been better.\n"
