We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes from his deceased wife. The author got angry and made a comment about the fianc\u00e9e stretching the dress, which he later regretted. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotions involved. The author is a widower who just lost his wife two years ago. The clothes in the closet are personal items that haven't been dealt with yet. The fianc\u00e9e, who is also a piano teacher to his children, is moving in and using the same closet. She tried on the clothes without permission, which the author found upsetting.\n\nThe key points here are consent and sensitivity. The author didn't explicitly tell his fianc\u00e9e she couldn't touch his wife's belongings, just that she could store her own clothes if there was space. So maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't realize it was off-limits. However, the author's reaction was harsh. He lashed out, made a comment about her body, which was hurtful, even if he didn't mean to imply she was fat. He later apologized, but the damage was done.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's action might have been inconsiderate. She was in a space with personal items and didn't ask before trying them on. But since the author didn't set clear boundaries, maybe she wasn't aware. The author's anger is understandable given the emotional weight of the situation, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate. He should have addressed it calmly first instead of yelling. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, both parties have some responsibility. The author didn't set boundaries clearly, but his reaction was unkind. The fianc\u00e9e should have asked before using the clothes. However, the author's comment about her body was the main issue here. Even if he was upset, saying something that could be interpreted as a body-shaming remark was wrong. He needs to take responsibility for that. But the fianc\u00e9e also didn't respect his personal space. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because his reaction was inappropriate, especially the hurtful comment. However, the fianc\u00e9e did make a mistake by not seeking permission. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is more likely A (Yes). The main issue is the author's response, not just the act itself. He could have handled it better without making a personal attack.\n"
