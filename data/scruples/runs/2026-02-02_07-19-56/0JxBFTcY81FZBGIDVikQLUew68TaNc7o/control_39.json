We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The clothes are in a shared closet, and he hadn't cleaned them out. He did mention the closet to his fianc\u00e9e, telling her she could use space if there was room. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes without permission, which led to conflict.\n\nThe author's anger seems to stem from the emotional value of the clothes. They belonged to someone he loved and lost, so it's understandable he'd be upset. However, his response included an offhand comment about the dress being stretched because his fianc\u00e9e is a different size. That part was hurtful and not appropriate, regardless of the situation. He immediately regretted it and apologized, but the damage was done.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e did go through the clothes without asking. Even if the closet was shared, personal items of a deceased person can be sensitive. She might have thought it was okay since she was moving in, but boundaries are important here. The author had a right to be upset about her respecting his personal space and items.\n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong for the hurtful comment, but the fianc\u00e9e also crossed a boundary. The question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The key point is whether his anger was justified. While his comment was inappropriate, his initial frustration about the clothes being tried on without permission is valid. However, the way he expressed it was wrong. The answer might hinge on the comment being the main issue, but the situation is nuanced.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often focus on the immediate action that caused harm. The author's comment about her stretching the dress was a direct hurtful remark. Even if he was upset, that line crosses into being an asshole. So, he's partly in the wrong for that. However, the fianc\u00e9e's actions also contributed to the conflict. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes) because the comment was uncalled for, even though the situation is complex. Alternatively, B (no) if the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's action, but the author's response was just a mistake.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the author made a hurtful comment, but the fianc\u00e9e also acted without permission. However, in AITA terms, the person who says a hurtful thing, even in anger, is often considered in the wrong. So the answer is likely A.\n"
