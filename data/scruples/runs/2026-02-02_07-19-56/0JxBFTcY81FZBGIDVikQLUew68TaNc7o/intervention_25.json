We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. His fianc\u00e9e, who was his daughter's piano teacher, is moving in with him. The master bedroom has a closet with his late wife's belongings, and he hasn't cleaned it out yet. He told his fianc\u00e9e she could store some clothes there. However, when he finds her trying on his late wife's clothes, he gets angry and makes a comment about the dress stretching because the late wife was a different size.\n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, the clothes belong to his late wife, and even though the author hasn't dealt with them yet, the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission to go through or use them. The act of trying them on without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author's anger might be understandable due to grief, but his response was harsh. He made a comment about her size, which hurt her feelings. Even if he later apologized, the initial reaction was unkind. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight of going through the late wife's belongings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be grieving and not ready to part with his wife's clothes, so the fianc\u00e9e should have respected that. But since he told her she could store her clothes there, she might have assumed some access. However, trying on the clothes without checking if it's okay could be a mistake. The author's reaction was a bit much, but the fianc\u00e9e also had some responsibility to consider his feelings. But the main issue here is the fianc\u00e9e's actions, so the author might not be in the wrong. Wait, but the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key here is that the author told her she could store her clothes in the closet. That might imply that she has some access to the space, but the contents (his late wife's clothes) are personal. The fianc\u00e9e might not realize that she shouldn't go through or use those items. The author didn't explicitly say not to touch the clothes, but the closet is a space with personal items. So the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying them on without asking. However, the author's response was to lash out with a comment about her size, which is definitely hurtful. So he's partially at fault for his reaction, but the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for the initial action.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because he overreacted. If B (no), because she shouldn't have done that. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is a mix. But the question is specifically about the author's anger at her trying on the clothes. If he was angry at her for doing that, then he might not be in the wrong because she did cross a boundary. But if he's wrong for reacting harshly, even though she was in the wrong, then maybe A. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad at her. The answer depends on whether the fianc\u00e9e's action was wrong. If she was wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. If she wasn't wrong, then he is. \n\nGiven that the author's late wife's clothes are in a shared space and the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask, her action was a mistake. The author's right to be upset about boundary issues. However, his comment about the dress stretching was a harsh way to express that. So, the author is partially in the wrong for his reaction, but not for being angry. The main issue is the comment. But the question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. If the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, his reaction was inappropriate. The question is whether he is in the wrong for being mad, not his reaction. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something that crossed a boundary, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about that. The answer would be B (No). But the user thinks the author is in the wrong because of his reaction. But the question specifically is about the anger at the action, not the harsh comment. So, the answer depends on whether the action itself is wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but his reaction was wrong. However, the question is only about the initial anger. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
