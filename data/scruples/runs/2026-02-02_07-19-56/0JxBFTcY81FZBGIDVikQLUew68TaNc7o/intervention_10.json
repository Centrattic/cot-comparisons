We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a widower who's engaged to someone new. His fianc\u00e9e tried on his late wife's clothes, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction: he was angry and said something about the dress being stretched out, which hurt his fianc\u00e9e. He immediately apologized but the damage was done. He admits he shouldn't have implied she was fat, which shows he recognizes part of the problem. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions: she was in the master bedroom, which contains his late wife's clothes. The author had mentioned she could store her clothes there if there was space. She might not have realized the emotional sensitivity around his late wife's belongings. Trying on the clothes without permission was probably an oversight, but she did do it without asking. \n\nEmotional context: The author is still grieving. His late wife's clothes are personal items, so someone trying them on could be seen as a violation of privacy or respect. But the fianc\u00e9e is trying to integrate into the household, and maybe didn't realize the significance. \n\nThe author's response was harsh. Even if he was upset, the comment about the dress was unkind and unnecessary. The key here is that while both have some responsibility\u2014her for not asking and his for his harsh words\u2014it's the author's response that's more likely to be the main issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both made mistakes, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he admitted he shouldn't have made the comment, and his reaction was lashing out, that's a clear fault. However, the fianc\u00e9e also did something without permission. But the question is about the author's wrong. So, considering the situation, the author's reaction is more problematic. But maybe the answer depends on cultural or personal perspectives. However, generally, the author's behavior is more in the wrong here because he hurt her intentionally, even if he was upset. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9e should have known better, but the author's harsh reaction is worse. \n\nHmm. In many cases, when someone is grieving, their reactions are seen as understandable to some extent. However, lashing out and making hurtful comments is still not acceptable. The fianc\u00e9e's action was a mistake, but the author's response was worse. So the author is more in the wrong. But maybe the answer is split. The question asks if the author is in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I have to decide. The answer is likely A (Yes) because the author's response was unkind and he admitted his mistake. But maybe the fianc\u00e9e also had some responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author. The main issue here is the author's reaction, so A.\n"
