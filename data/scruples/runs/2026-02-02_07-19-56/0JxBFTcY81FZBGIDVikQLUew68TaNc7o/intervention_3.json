We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his late wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, the context: He's a widower with four kids, engaged to his fianc\u00e9e who used to be his oldest daughter's piano teacher. They've been dating for a year and are now engaged. The fianc\u00e9e is moving into the master bedroom with him. The walk-in closet has his late wife's clothes, which he hasn't cleaned out. He told her she could store some of her clothes there if there was space. She ended up trying on the late wife's clothes, and he was upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are emotional sensitivity around a deceased spouse's belongings and communication. The author's reaction was anger, which led to hurtful words. He later regretted saying \"you're stretching out the dress,\" which implied a body-shaming comment, even if unintentional. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and accused him of lashing out.\n\nNow, considering grief and boundaries: The author is still grieving, and the clothes represent a significant emotional connection to his late wife. It's reasonable for him to feel that those items should be handled with care and respect. However, his response might have been too harsh. He didn't clearly communicate his boundaries beforehand. If he hadn't told her to store her clothes there without specifying that the closet is off-limits, he might share some responsibility for not setting clear expectations.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions could be seen as a lack of sensitivity. She might not have realized the emotional weight of those clothes, especially since they belong to his deceased wife. However, she was following his initial instruction to use the space. Her trying on the clothes without prior discussion might have been inconsiderate, but the author's response of calling her an asshole and making a body-related comment escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author is partially in the wrong for not setting clearer boundaries and for his hurtful remarks. The fianc\u00e9e is also in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact of her actions. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he admitted he shouldn't have implied she was fat and his anger was directed in a harmful way, he shares responsibility. But since the fianc\u00e9e crossed a boundary by trying on the clothes without permission, both sides have issues. But according to the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A. But maybe the answer is a mix. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation, the answer might be B (No), because the fianc\u00e9e's action was the issue, but the author's response was also inappropriate. But the main question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's anger is understandable, but his reaction was excessive. So the answer might be A (Yes) because he's in the wrong for his reaction, even if the fianc\u00e9e's action was also inappropriate. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at her for trying on the clothes. If the clothes weren't supposed to be used, then he's not in the wrong for being upset. But his reaction was wrong. The question is about being mad at her for trying on the clothes. So maybe the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong for being angry, but his response was wrong. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA for being mad...\" So the focus is on the anger itself. If being angry is the issue, then maybe not. But the author's problem is the reaction, not the anger. The fianc\u00e9e did something that was a boundary issue. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for being angry about the action, even if his response was inappropriate.\n"
