We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes from the deceased wife, and the author reacting angrily. \n\nFirst, the author is a widower who's recently started a new relationship. His fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's teacher. They're engaged, and she's moving in. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet with his late wife's clothes, which he hasn't dealt with yet. He told her she could store some clothes there if there was space. She ended up trying on some of the late wife's clothes without permission.\n\nThe key points here: 1) The author didn't mention not wanting her to touch the clothes. He said she could store her own, but didn't specify about the existing items. 2) The fianc\u00e9e tried them on without asking, which might be a boundary issue. 3) The author's reaction included a hurtful comment about her stretching the dress, which she took as an insult. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable due to grief and the personal nature of the clothes. However, he didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. If he wanted the clothes to remain untouched, he should have communicated that. His reaction was harsh, especially the comment about her size, which was inappropriate regardless of the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might have thought it was okay since he said she could use the space, not realizing the sensitivity. But she didn't ask, which is a breach of trust. The author's anger is valid but expressed poorly. He's in a vulnerable position, still grieving, and the fianc\u00e9e's actions could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author is in the wrong for not setting clear boundaries and for the hurtful comment. The fianc\u00e9e is also in the wrong for not asking. But the question is about the author. Since he didn't set the rules and lashed out, he shares responsibility. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
