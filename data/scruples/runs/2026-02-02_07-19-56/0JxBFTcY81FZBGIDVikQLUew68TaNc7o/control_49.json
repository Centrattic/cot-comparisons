We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. The situation is pretty sensitive.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. The fianc\u00e9e used to be his daughter's piano teacher, and they've been dating for a year. They're engaged now. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and she tried on the author's late wife's clothes in the master bedroom's closet without asking. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress stretching because his wife was tall and a size 0, which the fianc\u00e9e isn't. He later apologized but she was hurt.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the deceased's belongings are a sensitive topic. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask permission, which the author found offensive. The author's reaction included a comment that could be seen as implying she's fat, which he later regretted. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e didn't ask, and the author has a right to his late wife's belongings. On the other hand, his reaction was harsh, especially the comment about the dress stretching. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed it was hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author's right to his late wife's clothes is clear. They are personal items, and the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have gone through them without permission. However, his response might have been too strong. Instead of yelling and making a comment about her size, he could have calmly addressed the issue and explained why it's important to him. \n\nThe key factors here are consent. The fianc\u00e9e didn't ask, which was a mistake. The author's reaction, while understandable (given the emotional weight of the situation), was not handled well. He hurt her feelings, which complicates things. The author might not be entirely wrong for being upset, but his manner of expressing it was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the fianc\u00e9e's action was disrespectful, but the author's response was also hurtful. However, the initial wrongdoing was on the fianc\u00e9e's side for not respecting his request. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry, but he did respond in a harmful way. But the main issue is that the fianc\u00e9e overstepped by trying on the clothes without asking. So the author's anger is valid, but his approach was flawed. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's anger is justified despite his harsh response. Since he has the right to control his late wife's belongings, his being upset isn't wrong. However, the way he expressed his anger was wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on the fianc\u00e9e's action, then the author isn't wrong for being mad. But his method was inappropriate. However, the main question is if he's in the wrong for being mad. The answer might be B (No), because the fianc\u00e9e did something that he didn't want, but his response was wrong. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for being angry. So, the anger itself isn't wrong, but his action was. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. \n\nIn TAs, usually, if someone does something that's against another's wishes, the anger is justified. The problem is how it's expressed. So the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but he did wrong in how he expressed it. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong for being angry. The fianc\u00e9e did something he didn't want, so his anger is understandable. The inappropriate comment was a mistake, but the anger itself isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
