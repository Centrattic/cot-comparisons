We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on their deceased wife's clothes. The author is a 36-year-old widower with four kids, engaged to a former piano teacher who's 24. The fianc\u00e9e tried on the late wife's clothes in the master bedroom's closet, which still has the author's wife's items. The author told their fianc\u00e9e to clean up and said \"you're stretching out the dress,\" which was mean because the late wife was tall and a size 0. Then he apologized.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes without permission. The author is upset, which is understandable since those clothes are from his deceased wife. Grief can make certain actions more sensitive. However, the way he reacted might be part of the problem. Saying \"you're stretching out the dress\" is a direct jab at her size, even if the author claims it's not an issue. That's a low blow and could be seen as body-shaming, which is definitely not okay. \n\nThe author's right to be upset is valid because the clothes are personal items. But the fianc\u00e9e's action of trying them on without asking could have been a boundary issue. The question is whether the author overreacted. He did apologize, but the initial harsh response might have been unkind. Also, the fianc\u00e9e is moving in with him, so it's reasonable for her to handle shared spaces carefully. However, the author's grief might influence his reaction, and the fianc\u00e9e may not fully understand his emotional state yet. \n\nBut the key point here is the author's reaction. Even if he was justified in being upset, the way he expressed it was hurtful. The fianc\u00e9e is in a vulnerable position, trying to integrate into a new family, and body-shaming her after a traumatic event could damage the relationship. The author should have handled it with more empathy and communication. Instead of lashing out, maybe he should have explained his feelings and set boundaries. \n\nSo even though there's some fault on the fianc\u00e9e's side for not respecting the author's feelings about the clothes, the author's harsh response makes him at least partially in the wrong. The situation is complex, but in terms of right vs. wrong, the author definitely overstepped by making a comment about her body size. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
