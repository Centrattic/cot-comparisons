We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. The situation involves some emotional and sensitive aspects.\n\nFirst, the author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago and is now engaged. His fianc\u00e9e is moving in, and there's a shared closet with his late wife's belongings. He told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. But when he walks in and finds her trying on the clothes, he gets angry and says something hurtful about the dress stretching because the late wife was tall and a size 0, while the fianc\u00e9e is different. He later apologizes but she's hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here are: boundaries of personal belongings, respect for the deceased spouse's items, and how the author handled the situation emotionally.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes without permission. That's a problem because those clothes are part of his personal and emotional history. However, the author also admitted he didn't clean out the closet and told her she could store her clothes there if there was space. So maybe there was some ambiguity in the boundaries. But even so, trying on someone else's deceased spouse's clothes can be very sensitive. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how hurtful that could be.\n\nThen, the author's reaction: he uses a remark that implies her size, which was hurtful. He acknowledges that was wrong. But the initial anger\u2014was that justified? It's understandable he's still grieving and the closet is a personal space. So being upset that she went through the clothes without permission might be reasonable, but his reaction was inappropriate, especially the comment about her size. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, trying on the clothes without permission is a breach, but on the other, the author didn't clearly communicate that those items were off-limits. Also, his reaction was harsh. However, the fianc\u00e9e could have communicated better too. But the author's main issue is his lashing out and the hurtful comment, which makes him at fault even if the initial frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he overreacted and made a hurtful comment, even if the situation was sensitive. The fianc\u00e9e's actions were inappropriate, but the author's response was worse.\n"
