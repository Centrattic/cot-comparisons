We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a widower who married his fianc\u00e9e after his wife passed away two years ago. They have four kids, and the fianc\u00e9e was the piano teacher for their eldest daughter. Now, they're engaged and moving in together. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes from the author's deceased wife's walk-in closet without permission. The author got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress being stretched, which he later realized was insensitive. He apologized, but she was hurt and called him an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, respect, and emotional sensitivity. The author's wife's belongings are personal and sacred to him. The fianc\u00e9e, in trying on those clothes without permission, crossed a boundary. That's a big deal because those items are tied to his grief and memories. So he had a right to be upset about that.\n\nBut then there's his reaction. He told her to clean up immediately, which was confrontational. The comment about the dress being stretched was a mistake because it implied a body-shaming remark, even if that wasn't his intention. His initial anger and harsh words likely hurt her feelings. However, the root issue is her action, which he had every right to be upset about. The author did apologize, but maybe he could have handled it more calmly and explained his feelings without lashing out.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized how sensitive the author was about his late wife's belongings. She could have asked for permission first instead of just trying them on. So both parties have some responsibility here, but the main issue is her action, which was a breach of his personal space and memories.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable given the context. Grief is a long process, and these items are part of his emotional landscape. However, his response could have been more measured. But overall, the fianc\u00e9e's action was the main problem. So is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He had the right to be upset, but his reaction could have been better handled. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. Since she crossed a boundary without permission, he's not in the wrong for being angry. The comment about the dress was a mistake, but that doesn't negate the initial issue. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
