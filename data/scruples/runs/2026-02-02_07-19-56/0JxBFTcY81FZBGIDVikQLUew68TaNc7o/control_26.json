We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that their fianc\u00e9e tried on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a widower who lost his wife two years ago. They have four kids, and the fianc\u00e9e was the piano teacher for the eldest daughter. They now live together, and the fianc\u00e9e moved into the master bedroom where the deceased wife's clothes are stored.\n\nThe main issue is the fianc\u00e9e trying on the clothes without permission. The author was angry and made a comment about her stretching the dress, which he later regretted. The fianc\u00e9e felt hurt and called him an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, the clothes belong to his deceased wife, and he hasn't processed letting go of her. The closet is a personal space for him, and the fianc\u00e9e entering and trying on clothes without permission might be seen as crossing a boundary. He was in a vulnerable place, still grieving, so his anger could be a reaction to that.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight of the clothes. She was allowed to store her clothes in the closet, so maybe she didn't think trying on a few items was a big deal. However, the author did mention the closet contained personal items, which should have been a clue not to go through them.\n\nThe author's comment about her stretching the dress was hurtful and out of line, even if he meant to imply something else. He should have chosen his words more carefully. However, the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e trying on clothes without permission might be the root of the problem. \n\nBut who is more in the wrong? The author's anger could be partly due to unresolved grief, but he did overreact. The fianc\u00e9e might have been respectful if she knew the significance. Did the author communicate his boundaries clearly? He said he hadn't cleaned out the closet and told her to store her clothes if there was space. That might not have been enough to prevent her from going through the clothes.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The author for not being more explicit about not touching the clothes and the fianc\u00e9e for not respecting the personal items. But the author's harsh reaction, especially the comment about her body, was definitely wrong. He should have addressed the issue without attacking her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was inappropriate and hurtful. However, there's nuance where the fianc\u00e9e also had some responsibility. But the main question is if the author is in the wrong. Since his reaction was the immediate problem, even if the fianc\u00e9e's actions were part of the issue, his response was the direct cause of the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
