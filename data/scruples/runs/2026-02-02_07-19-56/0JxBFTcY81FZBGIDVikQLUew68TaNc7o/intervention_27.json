We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is a widower, his wife died two years ago. He's engaged to his fianc\u00e9e, who is his kids' piano teacher. The fianc\u00e9e is moving in and tried on his late wife's clothes without asking. He got angry, told her to clean up, and made a comment about the dress stretching because of her size. He later apologized but she was hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the author's emotional reaction is understandable. The clothes are from his late wife, which could be a sensitive and personal item. He mentioned not cleaning out the closet because he hasn't wanted to. So, it's possible that the fianc\u00e9e didn't realize the emotional weight of those items. The author might have felt violated or that the items were private.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e was trying on the clothes without permission. Even if she didn't mean to, entering into the walk-in closet and using the late wife's belongings could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the author's reaction of calling her an asshole and making a comment about her size (even if it wasn't his intention) might have been harsh. He admitted regretting his words, which shows he acknowledged the mistake in that part.\n\nBut the core issue is whether he's in the wrong for being mad about her trying on the clothes. Since the clothes belong to his late wife, he might have a right to be upset. However, the way he handled it could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9e might have expected more communication about what's acceptable regarding the late wife's belongings. The author should have addressed the issue calmly and explained his feelings instead of lashing out. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset, but his reaction (especially the harmful comment) and lack of communication prior to the situation contributed to the problem. The fianc\u00e9e\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5 have asked before using the clothes, but the author's response was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made a mistake in how he reacted, but the initial anger might be justified. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission, the author isn't entirely wrong. But his harsh reaction makes him partially at fault. The answer would likely be that he's not entirely wrong (B), but there's nuance. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe I need to decide based on the main action\u2014trying on clothes without permission versus the reaction. \n\nIn the end, the author's right to be upset is valid, but his reaction was the issue. However, the main question is if he's in the wrong for being mad about the trying on. If the answer is about the initial anger, then maybe he's not in the wrong (B). But if the answer considers the entire interaction, including the harsh words, then maybe A. But the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong for being mad about the trying on. So focusing on that, maybe he isn't (B). However, the fianc\u00e9e did overstep, so he's justified. But some might argue that being angry at the fianc\u00e9e for a mistake she made (even if it's a sensitive issue) is inconsiderate. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), because the fianc\u00e9e did something without permission, and the author has a right to be upset. However, his reaction was inappropriate, which complicates things. But the main question is about being angry at her for trying on the clothes. So, he's not in the wrong for being mad, but his handling of it was wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
