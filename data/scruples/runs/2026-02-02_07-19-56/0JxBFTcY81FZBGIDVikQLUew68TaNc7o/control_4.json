We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is a widower who's engaged to his girlfriend, and she tried on his deceased wife's clothes without his permission. He's angry about that and wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author is still dealing with the loss of his first wife two years ago. The walk-in closet has her belongings, which are personal and might be a sensitive area for him. He mentioned he hasn't cleaned it out and never wanted to, so it's a place of memory and grief. The fianc\u00e9e's action of trying on the clothes could be seen as intrusive, especially since he had only given her permission to store some clothes if there was space, not to use or try on the items.\n\nBut, the author's reaction was to call her an asshole and say she was stretching the dress, which implied a body-shaming remark. That's definitely a problem. Even if he was upset, the way he expressed his anger hurt her feelings. The fianc\u00e9e might have not realized the closet was off-limits, especially if the author's intentions weren't clearly communicated. However, trying on someone's deceased spouse's clothes without permission is a boundary issue. \n\nThe author's main point is about being mad she tried the clothes without asking, but his choice of words was unkind. The question is whether he's in the wrong for his anger. Even though his reaction was poor, the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e might have been a mistake. The author should have communicated his boundaries earlier, but the fianc\u00e9e should have respected them. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's right to be upset about his late wife's belongings is valid, but lashing out and using hurtful language is not. So while both parties might have some responsibility, the author's actions (the harsh words) are part of the problem. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action was also a breach of personal space. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. The key here is the author's reaction and the initial action. The fianc\u00e9e's attempt to try on the clothes was inappropriate, but the author's response was equally so. The author might argue that he's not in the wrong because the action itself was wrong, but his harsh reaction complicates that. \n\nI think the main issue is the author's handling of the situation. He should have expressed his feelings calmly and addressed the boundary. His initial anger leading to body-shaming is definitely wrong. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because of how he reacted, even if the fianc\u00e9e's action was also inappropriate. The question is about being \"mad\" and the justification for it. While the fianc\u00e9e did something wrong, the author's response made it worse. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
