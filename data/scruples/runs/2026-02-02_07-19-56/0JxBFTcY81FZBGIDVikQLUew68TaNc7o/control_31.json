We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being angry at their fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a widower with four kids, and the fianc\u00e9e was their eldest daughter's piano teacher. They've been engaged for two weeks, and the fianc\u00e9e is moving in. The closet with the deceased wife's belongings hasn't been cleared. The author told the fianc\u00e9e she could store her clothes there if there was space, but didn't mention the deceased wife's items.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e tried on the clothes, and the author reacted angrily, even making a comment about her stretching out the dress, which implied a body-shaming remark. The fianc\u00e9e was hurt, and the author apologized but the issue remains. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's emotional response to the fianc\u00e9e interacting with his late wife's belongings, the comment about the dress that was hurtful, and the fact that the author didn't explicitly say the clothes shouldn't be touched. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from grief and the sensitivity around his late wife's belongings. However, his reaction was lashing out with a hurtful comment. Even if he was upset, the way he responded is definitely inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the emotional weight of those clothes and the act of trying them on without permission. \n\nBut the author did tell her she could store clothes there if space allowed. Maybe he didn't clarify that the other items were off-limits. However, the act of trying on someone's deceased spouse's clothes can be seen as intrusive. The fianc\u00e9e might have thought she was just using the space as allowed, but didn't consider the emotional impact.\n\nBut the main issue is the author's reaction. He made a comment that was body-shaming, which is a clear fault. Even if he was upset, that kind of remark is inappropriate. So, while the fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped by not respecting boundaries, the author's response was definitely wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he lashed out in a harmful way, even if his feelings were hurt by her actions. The comment about her stretching the dress was the key mistake here.\n"
