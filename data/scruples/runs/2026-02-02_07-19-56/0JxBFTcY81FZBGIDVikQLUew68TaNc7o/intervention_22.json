We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.\n\nI am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. \n\nMy current fianc\u00e9e used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.\n\nSo leading up to the wedding my fianc\u00e9e is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fianc\u00e9e she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.\n\nYesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fianc\u00e9e what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.\n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fianc\u00e9e is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fianc\u00e9e was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.\n\nThat being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fianc\u00e9e for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his fianc\u00e9e for trying on his deceased wife's clothes. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. He's a widower who lost his wife two years ago, has four kids, and his fianc\u00e9e is a teacher who became his partner. They're engaged, and she's moving in. The walk-in closet with his late wife's belongings is still in the master bedroom. He told her she could use the space if there was room. She tried on some clothes, and he got angry, said something about the dress being stretched because of her size, which he later realized was hurtful.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about his reaction. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e might have overstepped by trying on the clothes without permission. On the other hand, the author's response was harsh and possibly inappropriate. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author's anger could stem from the emotional sensitivity around his late wife's belongings. It's understandable that he might feel uncomfortable with someone else using those items. However, he did give permission for her to store her clothes in the closet. If the closet is shared space, she might not realize the boundary he wanted to keep. \n\nBut then, his reaction\u2014saying she was stretching the dress\u2014could be interpreted as body-shaming, even if that wasn't his intention. That part definitely hurt her. Even if he didn't mean to imply she was fat, the words were hurtful. Also, the fact that he got angry enough to lash out suggests that his emotional boundaries were crossed, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e might have a point in feeling hurt and maybe she shouldn't have tried on the clothes without discussing it first. But the author's response was to criticize her body, which is a sensitive issue. So both sides have some responsibility here, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent vs. impact. Even if his intent was to protect his late wife's memories, the impact of his words was harmful. So he's not entirely wrong, but he did make a mistake in how he handled it. However, the initial action of the fianc\u00e9e might also be a problem. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. The key here is the author's reaction. Even if he's justified in being upset, the way he reacted was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e tried on clothes he hadn't wanted to deal with, and he didn't handle it well. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his response was harmful, even if the situation was sensitive. Alternatively, maybe B because he has a valid reason to be upset. \n\nHmm. It's a tricky one. The author's anger is understandable, but his lashing out and the specific hurtful comment make him at least partially at fault. However, the fianc\u00e9e's action without permission is also problematic. But in these kinds of situations, people often look for who has the bigger fault. Since the author's response was more directly harmful, he might be the one in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
