We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 18, his girlfriend is 19. They met on Instagram, and she has this edgy, grunge aesthetic. He's okay with her edgelord comments about hating people and life being better in the 80s. But she also intensely hates babies and kids. She avoids them, gives dirty looks, makes excuses. At a family party, she ended up holding a baby while changing a diaper, then put the baby down immediately and acted very rude. The author found this behavior annoying and disrespectful. He told her it's ridiculous to act that way, and she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author was wrong to tell her that her dislike of babies is pathetic and not cool. The user is asking if he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's behavior. She's uncomfortable around kids, which is fine. But her actions\u2014moving away from a cousin, flicking a blanket, acting rudely at the baby\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is pointing out that if she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no. But she didn't, and then acted obnoxiously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to call her behavior \"ridiculous\" and tell her it's pathetic and not cool. That could be seen as dismissive or invalidating her feelings. Even if the behavior is inconsiderate, the way he confronted her might have been harsh.\n\nBut then again, the author is also within his right to express his feelings about her actions. Relationships require communication, and he's addressing something that's bothering him. The question is if he was wrong in how he expressed it. If he was condescending or didn't listen to her reasons, that's a problem. However, the girlfriend's actions did cause issues, so the author has a valid point.\n\nI need to balance both sides. The author is not wrong for addressing the problem, but his method might have been better phrased. However, the question is specifically whether he is in the wrong. If his criticism was valid (her actions were inconsiderate) then he's not wrong. But if his approach was too harsh, maybe he is. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, so perhaps the answer is B (No), because he's not wrong for pointing out her inconsiderate behavior, even if the way he did it could be improved. But maybe the answer is A if his criticism was unwarranted.\n\nWait, the girlfriend's dislike of kids is just a preference. She might not consider it inconsiderate to avoid them. However, her actions in the party (putting down the baby, flicking the blanket) were rude. So the author is right to point out the inconsiderate actions, but maybe not the dislike itself. But he called her hate for babies \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool. That's more of a judgment on her personality trait, not just her actions. So even if her actions were rude, is it fair to criticize her dislike of babies as pathetic?\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for labeling her feelings as pathetic, which is more of an attack on her character rather than her actions. But he's also right about her actions being inconsiderate. The line here is thin. If the author was addressing her actions and how they affected others, that's okay. But if he's belittling her personal preferences, that's another thing. The question is whether he's in the wrong for saying her hate is pathetic. That seems like a judgment call. Depending on the context, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's expressing his perspective. But others might say that it's not his place to judge her feelings. So it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate concerns, but the approach matters. The author could have expressed his concerns without calling her behavior pathetic. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's raising a valid issue, but his method could be better. The answer likely depends on whether the criticism was constructive or just dismissive. Since he called it \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool,\" which are more about her edgy persona than the actions, he might be in the wrong for focusing on her traits rather than the behavior. So perhaps the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he dismissed her feelings and made it about her being uncool, which isn't productive. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's addressing a problem in the relationship. It's a bit ambiguous. I think in this context, the key is that the author is not wrong for speaking up, but his tone was harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions were rude, he has a point, but his delivery might be the issue. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not if his approach could be improved. If his criticism was valid (her actions were inconsiderate) then he's not wrong. So maybe B (No).\n"
