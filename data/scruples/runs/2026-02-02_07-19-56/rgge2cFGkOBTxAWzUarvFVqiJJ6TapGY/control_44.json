We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author criticized their girlfriend for hating babies, calling it pathetic and not making her cool or edgy. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments about hating people and kids. The key incident was her being rude with a baby at a family party, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's dislike for babies is clear, and she acted in a way that was disrespectful, like moving away from a child and flicking a blanket. The author confronted her, which led to her calling him an asshole. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to criticize her. To decide, I should consider if the author's reaction was justified. The author's issue is that the girlfriend's behavior is rude and unrealistic. The girlfriend's dislike for kids isn't illegal, but the way she acted (avoiding kids rudely, handling a baby improperly) could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she's wrong, but was that the wrong approach? It's possible that the author's tone was harsh, but the girlfriend's actions were definitely problematic. The author might need to address the behavior rather than just the attitude. However, the author's criticism might have been valid, given her inconsiderate actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior could be due to social anxiety or genuine discomfort, which might need empathy. But the author's frustration is understandable. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong for pointing that out. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
