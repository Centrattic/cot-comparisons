We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her dislike of babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been dating four months. She has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes \"edgelord\" comments, which the author finds cringe but manages. The main issue is her intense dislike for babies and kids, which led to her getting a baby dirty and acting obnoxious. The author confronted her, and she called him an asshole.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (avoiding kids, making excuses, being rude) seem extreme and socially inappropriate. The author's frustration is about her handling the situation poorly, not just her dislike of babies. He's not attacking her feelings but her behavior. \n\nBut the way he told her that her hate is \"pathetic\" and not cool could come off as dismissive. Maybe he could have approached it more sensitively. However, her actions at the party were inconsiderate. The author's main point is that her behavior is unacceptable, not her dislike per se. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting her feelings and addressing her actions. The author's criticism is about her behavior, which is valid. However, the way he phrased it might have been harsh. But overall, the girlfriend's actions were problematic. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
