We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author confronting his girlfriend about her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds pathetic and not actually cool. The girlfriend has some edgy, grunge aesthetics, and her behavior around kids is described as rude\u2014like avoiding her sister, moving away from a cousin, and being obnoxious during a family party with a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. The girlfriend's dislike of kids is her personal choice, but the way she expresses it (dirty looks, moving away, being obnoxious) could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a family setting. The author is frustrated because she's letting her personal preferences affect others. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's criticism was valid. The girlfriend's actions were disrespectful in a family context, so the author has a right to address them. However, the way he called her behavior \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool might be dismissive. But given the examples of her behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has the right to her preferences, but she also needs to consider others' feelings, especially in shared spaces. Her actions at the family party were inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong to point that out. The main issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. While he could have been more empathetic, his concern is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's addressing inconsiderate behavior, though his tone could have been better. The girlfriend's actions were problematic, so the author isn't at fault for confronting her.\n"
