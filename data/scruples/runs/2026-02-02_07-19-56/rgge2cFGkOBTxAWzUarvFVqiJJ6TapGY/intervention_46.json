We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has an edgy aesthetic and makes comments about hating people and preferring the 80s. She also dislikes kids and babies, to the point of being rude around them. The author got annoyed because her behavior was inconsiderate, like putting a baby down abruptly and flicking a blanket. He confronted her, saying her hate is pathetic, and now she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong here? The user thinks he is, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The girlfriend's behavior: she doesn't like kids, avoids them, acted rudely around a baby and cousin. The author's reaction: he called her behavior ridiculous and said her hate is pathetic. He might be right in pointing out that her actions were inconsiderate, but maybe he could have handled it more sensitively. However, she had been acting that way for a while, so the author might feel justified in addressing it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the issue with more empathy. Maybe she has underlying issues or reasons for her dislike of kids. But the problem is that she acted in a way that was socially inappropriate and affected others (like putting the baby down and getting the couch dirty). The author's criticism might be valid because her behavior was hurtful.\n\nBut is he in the wrong for confronting her? If he's in a relationship, he's allowed to express concerns about her actions, especially if they're causing problems. However, the way he called her behavior \"pathetic\" and linked it to her edgy persona might have been harsh. The key is whether his criticism was constructive or just harsh.\n\nThe author's main point is that she's being rude and expecting others to accommodate her dislike. He's right to point out that expecting kids to avoid her is unrealistic. However, the way he delivered the criticism might have been unkind. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong for speaking up, but could have handled it better. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether his criticism was justified despite the harshness.\n\nIn relationships, partners do have the right to address issues affecting them. So if her behavior was problematic, the author isn't wrong to address it. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
