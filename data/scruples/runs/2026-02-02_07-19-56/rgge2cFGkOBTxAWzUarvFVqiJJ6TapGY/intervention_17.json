We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend that her hate for babies is pathetic and not making her cool or edgy. The girlfriend acts this way, especially with kids, and the author is frustrated because her behavior is rude and inconsiderate. The question is whether he's at fault for calling her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On the author's side, he's pointing out that her behavior is inconsiderate. For example, she didn't want to hold the baby, but she didn't say no, leading to a mess. She also acts rude around kids, like pinching the blanket and moving away. The author is concerned that her attitude is not mature, especially since she's 19 and not in an emo phase anymore. He's trying to make her see that her actions affect others and that she needs to be more considerate.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she has a right to dislike babies. People have different preferences, and she's not forcing anyone else to interact with kids. However, her actions during the family party were inconsiderate. Moving away without politely declining, handling the baby poorly, and flicking the blanket\u2014these actions are rude and show a lack of respect for others' feelings, especially the new mom. The author's frustration is about her inconsiderate behavior, not her dislike per se.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for telling her that her hate is pathetic? Well, he's expressing his feelings about her behavior, which is valid. However, the way he phrased it as \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool\" might come off as condescending. But the core issue is her inconsiderate actions, not just her dislike. He's pointing out that her behavior is problematic in social situations. \n\nThe key points are whether her actions were inconsiderate and if the author's response was appropriate. The girlfriend's actions during the party were rude, so the author is justified in being upset. Telling her she's wrong about her attitude isn't wrong if the behavior is indeed problematic. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. But the main issue is her actions, so the author isn't in the wrong for calling out the behavior, even if his phrasing could be improved.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because he's addressing her inconsiderate behavior, which is a valid concern. The problem is her actions, not her dislike of babies. He's right to point out that her behavior is not acceptable in social settings.\n"
