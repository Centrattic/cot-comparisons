We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author confronting his girlfriend for her dislike of babies and children, which he finds rude and unreasonable. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which she's expressed through actions like avoiding them, making negative comments, and displaying rude behavior in a family setting. The author feels that her attitude is not justifiable and confronted her about it, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider both sides. The girlfriend's dislike of kids is a personal preference, but the way she expresses it\u2014by being rude, avoiding interactions, and acting obnoxiously\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, especially in social situations where others are present, like a family party. The author is pointing out that her actions have real-world consequences, like making the baby's mother uncomfortable or causing a mess. \n\nHowever, personal preferences and boundaries are important. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable around kids, she has the right to set her boundaries. The issue arises when those boundaries translate into disrespect or inconsiderate behavior towards others. The author's problem isn't just with her dislike but with the way she acts on it, which affects others.\n\nThe author's confrontation might be seen as valid if the girlfriend's actions were crossing into rudeness. But is it the author's place to tell her that her feelings are \"pathetic\"? That's where the potential fault lies. While her behavior might be inconsiderate, telling someone their feelings are pathetic is dismissive and could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's excuse that she has social anxiety and felt too afraid to say no adds another layer. Maybe she didn't communicate her discomfort effectively, leading to the awkward situation. The author is pointing out that she should have been honest about not wanting to hold the baby instead of leaving someone else to deal with the aftermath.\n\nSo, the author's criticism is about her behavior and its impact, not just her feelings. However, the way he phrased it (\"pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy\") might come off as judgmental. But given the context of her actions, he's addressing the behavior's consequences. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is trying to express his frustration with her behavior, which he finds inconsiderate. While his approach might not have been the most diplomatic, the core of his argument is about how her actions affect others. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the focus is on the validity of his concern about her behavior, then he's not. But if the way he expressed it is the main issue, then maybe. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her it's pathetic. Since her actions were indeed rude, even if her feelings are personal, he's justified in expressing his opinion. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
