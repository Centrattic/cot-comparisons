We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend her dislike of babies is pathetic and not cool. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments. She really dislikes kids and babies, which the author finds over the top.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is upset because his girlfriend's behavior towards babies is rude. She didn't want to hold the baby but didn't say no, then left it on the couch when she was done. She also moved away from a cousin and flicked a blanket. The author told her her hate is pathetic and not cool, which made her think he's an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, it's a relationship, and respecting each other's boundaries is important. Her dislike of babies might be a personal preference or a mental health issue (like social anxiety). Maybe she's uncomfortable and handles it poorly. The author's criticism might be dismissive of her feelings, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, she was in situations where she had to interact with babies, and her reactions were rude. The author is concerned about her expecting others to avoid her because of her dislike. He might be trying to help her improve her social interactions. But the way he criticized her (\"pathetic\", \"doesn't make her cool\") could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach might be too harsh. Instead of calling her feelings pathetic, he could have discussed the behavior's impact. However, she also needs to consider the feelings of others, like his sister who might be upset by her actions.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like both sides have valid points. The author might be right to address the behavior but did so in a way that's condescending. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, but her feelings towards babies aren't the issue. The author's criticism targets her feelings rather than the actions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for the way he approached it. However, if the behavior is unacceptable, he's not entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the criticism was harsh, the answer could be A. But I need to check if the action itself was wrong. Maybe both are at fault. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
