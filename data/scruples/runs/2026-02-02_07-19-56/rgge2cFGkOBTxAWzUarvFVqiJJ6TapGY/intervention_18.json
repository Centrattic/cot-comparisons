We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their girlfriend about her dislike of babies and children, which he finds rude and unreasonable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which she expresses through actions like avoiding them, giving dirty looks, and making derogatory comments. The author feels she's being inconsiderate, especially when she put a baby down without cleaning up and flicked a blanket. He called her behavior pathetic and not cool, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom the author's side, he's trying to address what he sees as inconsiderate behavior in a public setting. He's frustrated that she expects others to accommodate her dislike of kids without her making an effort herself. He might feel that her actions were disrespectful to the baby, the family, and even to him, as he found her edgelord comments cringey but manageable before.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have social anxiety and doesn't like being forced into uncomfortable situations. Her actions could stem from discomfort rather than malice. She might feel that her preferences are valid and that the author is overstepping by criticizing her. Her response about the author being an asshole suggests she feels attacked, which is a common reaction when someone's behavior is called out.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication style and respect. The author tells his girlfriend her hate is pathetic, which is dismissive and condescending. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, he labels her feelings as pathetic and uncool, which is harsh. Effective communication usually involves understanding the other's perspective before critiquing. The author could have approached the situation by expressing his feelings without attacking her, perhaps discussing how her actions made him feel and setting boundaries for future interactions.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's behavior might be a result of anxiety or past experiences, which the author hasn't acknowledged. The author's approach of calling her out in the moment might have been public or hurtful, escalating the conflict. Even if her actions were inappropriate, the way the author addressed it could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate. She didn't communicate her discomfort beforehand, leading to a situation where she put a baby down in a messy state. But the way the author handled it might not be the healthiest approach either. Both sides might have valid points, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's use of derogatory language towards the girlfriend's feelings and the confrontational approach could be seen as the wrong move, even if the girlfriend's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to handle disagreements with empathy. The author might have been right to address the issue, but the method could have been better. So, while the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response was also problematic because he dismissed her feelings and used harsh language. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because of how he addressed the issue, even though there was an issue to address.\n"
