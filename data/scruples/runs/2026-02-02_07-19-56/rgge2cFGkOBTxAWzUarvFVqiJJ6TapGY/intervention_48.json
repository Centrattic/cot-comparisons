We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author confronting his girlfriend about her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds obnoxious. The girlfriend has an edgy aesthetic and makes comments about hating people and kids. The author is upset because she was rude at his family party, especially with the baby and cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that his girlfriend's behavior is unacceptable, especially in a family setting. He's pointing out that she didn't handle the baby well and acted rudely. On the other hand, the girlfriend's dislike for kids is personal. Maybe she's uncomfortable around them, and her actions were a result of anxiety or genuine dislike. However, the author is concerned about her being rude and not standing up for herself properly, instead letting others handle it.\n\nThe key points here are respect, communication, and personal boundaries. The author criticizes her for not setting boundaries and for being obnoxious, but the girlfriend might feel that her preferences are valid. The author's response was to tell her she's being ridiculous, which might come off as dismissive of her feelings. However, the author is also entitled to express his discomfort with her behavior, especially in social situations.\n\nI should check if the author's actions were justified. He was trying to address her behavior, which is reasonable. But how he communicated it might have been hurtful. Insulting her by calling her comments \"pathetic\" and saying her hate is \"ridiculous\" could be seen as attacking her rather than discussing the issue. However, the girlfriend also needs to be considerate of others' feelings, especially in family gatherings. Her actions might have been inconsiderate, so the author has a point there.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should communicate their needs and expectations. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but his method of doing so could be improved. The girlfriend's behavior was inappropriate, so the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the way he handled the confrontation might have contributed to the conflict. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
