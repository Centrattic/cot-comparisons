We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who dislikes kids and expressed that in a rude way during a family party. The author called her out for being pathetic and not being cool.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's dislike for babies and kids is a big part of her edgy persona. She made a scene at the party by being uncooperative with the baby, causing a mess, and acting annoyed. The author confronted her, saying her behavior was pathetic, and now they're in a conflict.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for calling her out? Well, the girlfriend's actions were indeed rude and inconsiderate. She didn't handle the baby situation properly, which could have upset others, especially since the baby's mother was present. The author had a right to be upset because her actions reflected poorly on him and might have embarrassed his sister. \n\nHowever, the way the author addressed her\u2014calling her behavior \"pathetic\" and dismissing her edgy narrative\u2014might be harsh. While her actions were wrong, the author's response could come off as condescending. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing her discomfort without belittling her, might have been better. But does that make the author in the wrong? \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, so the author wasn't wrong to address it. The key issue is whether the author's criticism was justified. Since the girlfriend's actions were rude and the author had a legitimate reason to be upset, he's not in the wrong. However, the method of addressing it could be improved. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" so if the criticism was valid, even if the delivery was harsh, the author isn't wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
