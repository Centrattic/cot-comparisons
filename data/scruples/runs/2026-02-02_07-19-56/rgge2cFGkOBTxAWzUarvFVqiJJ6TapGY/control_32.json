We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who told his girlfriend that her dislike for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has an edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments, including hating babies and kids. The author is upset because she was rude at a family party, like putting down a baby and avoiding his cousin. He confronted her, and she's upset now.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong here. The main issue is whether the author was wrong to call her out. On one hand, everyone has the right to have their opinions, even if they're unpopular. However, acting out those opinions in a socially unacceptable way can be problematic. The girlfriend's behavior was rude, especially in front of family. The author was defending other people's feelings by pointing out her inconsiderate actions. \n\nBut did he go too far by calling her feelings \"pathetic\"? That's a judgment call. Telling someone their personal preferences are pathetic could be seen as dismissive. However, the author's frustration stems from her public rudeness. It's a balance between respecting her views and addressing her behavior.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions (like flicking the blanket, avoiding the cousin) are not just opinions but actions that could be seen as disrespectful. The author was highlighting the inconsistency between her claimed edgy persona and her inconsiderate behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he confronted her respectfully about her behavior, maybe not. But calling her feelings pathetic might be harsh. However, given the context of her rude actions, his frustration is understandable. The key is whether the confrontation was valid. Since her actions were problematic, pointing them out isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
