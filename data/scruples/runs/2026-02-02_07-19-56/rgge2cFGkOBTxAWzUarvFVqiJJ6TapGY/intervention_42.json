We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author, who's 18 years old, is dating a 19-year-old girlfriend. He found her cool because of her edgy and grunge style. However, she has a strong dislike for babies and kids, which he finds problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author criticizes his girlfriend for her behavior towards children. She acts negatively around kids, avoids them, and even had an incident at a family party where she handled a baby poorly. The author feels she's being rude and unrealistic by expecting to avoid kids entirely. He confronts her about it, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior might stem from personal preferences or discomfort. Maybe she's uncomfortable around children due to social anxiety or past experiences. She might not realize how her actions come off as offensive. Her edgy comments could be a way to cope or express herself, but the author finds it cringey and unacceptable.\n\nThe author's actions: he called her hatred for babies \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool or edgy. He confronted her after the party. The question is whether he was in the wrong. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, it's important how he approached the issue. If he was dismissive of her feelings or didn't consider her perspective, he might be at fault. However, if he expressed his concerns respectfully, maybe he's justified. The girlfriend's behavior could be seen as rude, especially in a family setting where avoiding interaction with relatives or guests isn't considerate.\n\nBut the author's tone in the AITA post is critical. He uses phrases like \"ridiculous\" and \"stupid edgy narrative,\" which might indicate he's being judgmental. He also mentions she's not 13 anymore, implying her behavior is childish. That could come off as condescending. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate and respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's dislike for kids is a personal choice, but acting out in public might be inconsiderate. The author's frustration is valid, but how he communicated his concerns might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the right (B), because he's addressing a valid concern about his partner's behavior that affects their social interactions and his family. However, if he was confrontational without understanding her reasons, he might share some blame. But given the description, he's trying to correct what he sees as her inappropriate behavior, which could be justified. So, maybe the answer is B.\n"
