We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about his girlfriend's dislike of babies and kids, and her behavior at a family party. The user is asking if he was wrong to call her out on it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that his girlfriend acts rudely around kids\u2014like giving dirty looks, moving away, and being obnoxious. At the party, she ended up holding a baby during a diaper change and then put the baby down in a messy way, causing a problem. He felt she was being too rude and should have handled the situation better, like saying no or getting help. He told her her hate for babies is pathetic and not cool, which upset her.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's defense is that she's into a grunge/edgy aesthetic and maybe sees herself as against the mainstream. She might feel that her aversion to kids is just her personality. She might also have social anxiety, making it harder for her to say no in the moment, leading to her acting out. Her comments about kids being \"disgusting\" and \"entitled\" are pretty harsh, but her reaction might stem from anxiety or discomfort rather than malice.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether her behavior was inappropriate and if the author was right to confront her. From what's described, her actions do seem rude\u2014especially moving away from the cousin, flicking the blanket, and how she handled the baby. The author has a right to be upset because her behavior could affect family dynamics and his own relationships. However, how he chose to address it matters. Telling her her feelings are \"pathetic\" and not cool might be dismissive of her feelings and could be seen as invalidating her perspective. Even if her actions were rude, the way he communicated his concerns could have been more constructive.\n\nBut then, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's criticism was about her behavior rather than her feelings, maybe he had a point. However, calling her hate \"pathetic\" and not cool might come off as condescending. People have different boundaries, but when it affects others (like putting a baby down messily), it's reasonable to address the behavior. The girlfriend's social anxiety complicates things, as she might not have the skills to handle such situations gracefully. The author might have a valid concern about her approach, but his tone could have been better.\n\nIn terms of the edgy persona, maybe the girlfriend uses being anti-kids as part of her image, but that doesn't excuse rude behavior. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way he communicated his feelings might have contributed to the conflict. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If he was trying to help her see that her actions are inconsiderate, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he phrased it (\"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool\") could be seen as attacking her identity rather than addressing her actions. That might be where he went wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he wanted to discuss her behavior, using \"I\" statements and discussing the impact of her actions would be better than labeling her feelings as pathetic. Therefore, the author's approach might have been unkind, even if his concern was valid. So, he might be partially in the wrong for the way he expressed his feelings, even if the issue itself is something worth addressing.\n"
