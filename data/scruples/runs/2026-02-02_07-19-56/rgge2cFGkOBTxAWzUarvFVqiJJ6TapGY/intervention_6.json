We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting his girlfriend about her dislike for babies and kids, which he finds edgy and inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes comments about hating people and preferring the 80s. She also has a strong aversion to kids, which led to her being rude at a family party where she had to hold a baby. The author is upset because she didn't handle the situation better and called her out for being obnoxious. Now, the girlfriend thinks the author is an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, is the author wrong here?\n\nWell, the girlfriend's behavior is definitely problematic. She had to hold the baby, got the couch dirty, and acted inappropriately. Her actions were rude and inconsiderate. The author's frustration is understandable. However, how he addressed it might be the issue. He told her her hate is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy. That's a harsh way to confront someone, especially in a relationship. It could come off as dismissive and invalidating of her feelings, even if her actions were wrong.\n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the author has a right to express his concerns. If he's in a relationship with her, communication is key. However, the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. The question is whether his criticism was justified or if he overstepped.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues respectfully. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" isn't constructive. It's possible the author's intent was to correct her behavior, but the method was harsh. However, the girlfriend's actions were clearly inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong to be upset.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the girlfriend is wrong in her behavior, and the author is wrong in his harsh criticism. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one who told her she's wrong in a derogatory way, maybe he's partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's actions were also problematic. The answer might depend on whether the author's response was proportionate. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. In AITA scenarios, sometimes both parties have some responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. If the author's response was unkind but his intention was to address a valid issue, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if his approach was dismissive, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nIn this case, the author's comments about her hate being \"pathetic\" and not making her cool are judgmental. It's better to address the behavior rather than the person. So maybe the author is in the wrong for the way he communicated his concerns, even if the girlfriend's behavior is also wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to be sure.\n"
