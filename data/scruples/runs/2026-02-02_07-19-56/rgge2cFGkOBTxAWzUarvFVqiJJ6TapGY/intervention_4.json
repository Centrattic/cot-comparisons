We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend her dislike for babies is pathetic and not cool or edgy. The user has a 19-year-old girlfriend who's into a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes comments about hating people and life being better in the 80s. She really dislikes kids, avoids them, even avoids her own four-year-old sister, gives excuses, etc. Then at a family party, she ends up holding a baby, gets the couch dirty, and acts obnoxious. The author confronts her, and she responds by calling kids \"disgusting\" and \"entitled\". The author is called an asshole.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. The options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overstepped. The author called their girlfriend's feelings \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool or edgy. That's pretty harsh. The girlfriend's dislike of kids might stem from personal preferences or even past experiences. While the girlfriend's behavior (moving away from kids, flicking a blanket) is rude, does that justify the author's response?\n\nThe author is in a relationship, so communication is key. However, telling someone their feelings are pathetic is dismissive and hurtful. The author could have expressed their concerns without belittling her. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's method of addressing the issue might be the problem. Relationships require mutual respect; if the author didn't like her behavior, they should address it respectfully, not by invalidating her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions at the party were inconsiderate. She didn't want to hold the baby but didn't handle it politely. The author has a valid concern about her intolerance towards kids. But the way he handled it might have been the issue. Instead of calling her pathetic, he could have discussed how her actions made him feel or set boundaries for future interactions.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, but the author's response might be seen as attacking her feelings rather than discussing the behavior. In relationships, it's important to address actions rather than invalidate emotions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they communicated their feelings, even if the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the author is indeed at fault here.\n"
