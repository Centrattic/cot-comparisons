We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is an 18-year-old guy who's been dating his girlfriend for four months. They met on Instagram, and she has a grunge/edgy aesthetic. She makes edgelord comments, like hating people and saying life was better in the 80s, which he finds cringey but manageable. The main issue is her intense dislike for babies and kids. She gives them dirty looks, moves away, makes excuses about them being dirty, etc. At a family party, she was left alone with his sister's baby during a diaper change. When his sister left, she put the baby down, got the couch dirty, and called it a \"gremlin.\" He's annoyed because she didn't just say no earlier. Also, she moved away from his cousin and flicked the baby blanket. On the way home, he told her her behavior is ridiculous, and she said kids are disgusting and entitled. He called her out on her edgy narrative, and she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down both sides. The girlfriend's behavior towards kids seems to cross into rudeness. She's not just uncomfortable with kids; she's actively avoiding them, treating them as if they're dirty, and being obnoxious. The author is frustrated that she expects people to know to avoid her and that she didn't just decline when asked to hold the baby. He's trying to tell her that her behavior is not acceptable, especially in a family setting where being polite is expected.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might feel that her personal preferences are being attacked. She has a certain aesthetic and lifestyle, and the author is criticizing her for being \"edgy\" or making cringey comments. She might feel that he's not respecting her boundaries or her way of expressing herself. Also, in a situation where she has social anxiety and was forced into holding the baby, maybe her reaction was a result of stress.\n\nNow, considering social norms. It's one thing to dislike kids, but acting in a way that's inconsiderate of others, especially in a family setting, could be seen as rude. The author is right to point out that if she doesn't want to interact with kids, she should communicate that upfront instead of reacting negatively when it happens. However, the way the author confronts her\u2014calling her comments \"pathetic\" and \"pathetic\"\u2014might come off as dismissive or condescending. He's using judgmental language, which can be hurtful even if his point is valid.\n\nBut wait, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his criticism is justified. He's pointing out her behavior towards kids is inappropriate, which is a valid concern. However, the way he addressed it\u2014calling her behavior \"ridiculous\" and dismissing her as an \"edgy\" person\u2014might be where he's wrong. Constructive criticism versus tearing someone down. Also, considering that they met online and she has social anxiety, maybe there's more context to her behavior that he isn't fully understanding.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's actions during the family party were inconsiderate and potentially embarrassing for the author. He's standing up for his family's feelings and the appropriateness of her behavior. However, his response was to belittle her views rather than discussing it calmly. So maybe the author is right in his concern but wrong in his approach.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If he's addressing a legitimate issue (her inconsiderate behavior), then he's not necessarily wrong. However, if his approach was disrespectful, then part of him could be in the wrong. The answer options are A or B, so it's a binary choice.\n\nIn relationships, communication styles matter. The author's tone comes across as dismissive and mocking (\"pathetic,\" \"stupid edgy narrative\"). That could be seen as invalidating her feelings, which might make him wrong in his approach. But the core issue of her behavior being inappropriate is valid. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the problem is how he addressed it rather than the content, then maybe he's not entirely wrong, but the way he did it is problematic.\n\nBut the options don't allow for a middle ground. The question is whether he is in the wrong. So considering the overall situation, the author had a valid concern about her inconsiderate behavior, but his method of addressing it was harsh. However, in typical AITA scenarios, if someone is pointing out a real issue, even if their tone is off, they might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the criticism is justified but delivered poorly, it's still a problem.\n\nIn this case, the author's criticism is valid (her behavior is rude), but the way he delivered it was unkind. However, the main question is about being in the wrong. If being in the wrong is about the action's validity, then he's not in the wrong for pointing out her rude behavior. But if it's about the manner, then maybe he's partially wrong. However, AITA usually considers both the action and the intent. The man's intent was to address a problem, but his method was harsh. However, since the girlfriend is being inconsiderate, the author isn't wrong for pointing it out. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), but some nuance is needed. Alternatively, if the author's words were unkind and contributed to the conflict, maybe A. But given the context, the core issue is her behavior, so he's justified in addressing it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
