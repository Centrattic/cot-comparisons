We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who dislikes babies and kids, and the author confronts her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend has a strong dislike for kids, which she expresses in various ways like avoiding them, making negative comments, and even acting rudely around them. The author is upset because she didn't handle a situation with the baby well, putting the baby down in a messy way and being inconsiderate. The author told her that her behavior is pathetic and not edgy, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author is frustrated with his girlfriend's behavior towards kids. He's pointing out that her actions are inconsiderate and that she's being rude. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her personal preferences are being criticized, especially her edgy aesthetic she's trying to maintain.\n\nIs the author entitled to express his opinion? He's in a relationship, so communication is key. But the way he told her her feelings are \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool or edgy\" could come off as dismissive and hurtful. He's invalidating her feelings rather than addressing the behavior. Maybe he should have approached it with more empathy, understanding that her dislike for kids is personal and not something she can control. However, her actions during the family event were inconsiderate and caused a problem, so the author isn't entirely wrong in pointing that out.\n\nBut the way he communicates his criticism is harsh. Instead of attacking her character (\"pathetic\"), he could have focused on the specific behavior and how it made him feel. That might have been more constructive. So maybe the author is partly at fault for the tone, but the girlfriend's behavior was also inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer isn't black and white. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's main mistake was how he communicated his concerns rather than the concern itself, then he might not be entirely in the wrong. But if his criticism was valid and the way he expressed it was the issue, then maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's behavior is a deal-breaker and the author is justified in addressing it, then he's not in the wrong. But if he overstepped in his criticism, then he might be at fault.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the partner is within their right to express their concerns, especially if the behavior is problematic. However, using harsh language can escalate the conflict. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong for pointing out the issue but could have handled it better. The key is whether his criticism was justified. Since the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, the author's concern is valid, but the approach could have been more respectful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's addressing a legitimate issue, but his method was poor. However, if the question is strictly about being in the wrong in the relationship dynamic, maybe A. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the options again. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. I think the author is not in the wrong because he's addressing valid behavior, but his communication is flawed. So the answer is B.\n"
