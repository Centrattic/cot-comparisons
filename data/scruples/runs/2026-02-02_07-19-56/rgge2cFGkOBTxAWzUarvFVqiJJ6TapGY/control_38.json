We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their girlfriend that her dislike of babies is pathetic and not cool. The girlfriend has an edgy, grunge aesthetic and makes edgelord comments about hating people and preferring the 80s. She also hates kids, acts rude around them, and had a specific incident where she dropped a baby at a family party, got angry, and was dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is frustrated because their girlfriend's behavior towards kids is rude and not acceptable. They tell her it's pathetic and not cool, which the girlfriend took as being an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's actions: They confronted their girlfriend about her behavior, which they found obnoxious. They called her attitude pathetic and not cool. The girlfriend's response is that kids are disgusting and entitled, and she doesn't want to deal with them. The author is trying to address a behavior that's causing issues, but the way they worded their criticism might be harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She dislikes kids, acts rudely around them, and in a social situation, she handled a baby poorly, leading to a mess. She has social anxiety but didn't refuse the task properly. Her excuses (like the kid being dirty) and the way she dealt with the baby's blanket (pinching it) are unkind and unhelpful.\n\nNow, considering the relationship context. The author is trying to address a problem that affects their family interactions. The girlfriend's behavior is impacting the author's parents and family events. The author's frustration is understandable. However, calling her attitude \"pathetic\" and \"pathetic\" might be condescending. It's possible that the author should have approached the conversation more constructively rather than dismissing her feelings as pathetic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is objectively rude. Disliking kids is a personal preference, but acting disdainfully towards them, especially when around family, is hurtful. The author has a right to be concerned about how their girlfriend treats others, especially in their family setting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the approach. The author is correct in pointing out the behavior's issues, but the way they communicated it could be improved. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's rude behavior, not the author's criticism. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address the problem. The key is whether the author's words were justified. Since the behavior is problematic, the author isn't entirely wrong. But maybe the delivery could be better. However, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
