We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given text is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't like babies and kids, and the author criticizes her for that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The girlfriend has an edgy aesthetic and makes comments about hating people and life being better in the 80s. She also dislikes kids, avoids them, and had an incident at a family party where she mishandled a baby, getting the couch dirty and acting rude. The author confronts her, and she defends her views, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for telling her that her hate for babies is pathetic and not cool. To determine this, I should consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be right to express concerns about her behavior being inconsiderate, especially in social situations. It's reasonable to want her to be more respectful towards others' children, even if she doesn't like them. Her actions at the party could be seen as unkind and socially unacceptable, so pointing that out is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might be harsh. Telling someone their opinions are \"pathetic\" and not \"cool\" can come off as dismissive and judgmental. Everyone has their preferences, and while the girlfriend's behavior might be rude, the author's response could be seen as attacking her personality rather than discussing the specific actions. It's possible that the author could have addressed the issue more constructively instead of criticizing her edgy persona.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's social anxiety and the pressure she was under to hold the baby without being able to refuse, maybe there's more context. The author might not have considered her feelings in the moment, which could be part of the problem.\n\nSo, weighing both perspectives: the author has valid concerns about her inconsiderate behavior, but the way he confronts her might be too harsh and disrespectful. The issue isn't just about the content of her views but how he communicated his disapproval. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for his approach, even if his concerns are legitimate.\n"
