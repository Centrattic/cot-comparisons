We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her dislike of babies is pathetic and not cool. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend has an aesthetic that includes being edgy, and she makes comments about hating people and kids. At a family event, she ended up holding a baby, got uncomfortable, and acted rudely. The guy is upset with her behavior and called her out.\n\nSo, the key points here: the woman's dislike of kids is part of her edgy persona. She acted unkindly around babies, which bothered the guy. He confronts her by saying her attitude is pathetic and not cool. The question is whether he was wrong for doing that.\n\nThe guy's argument is that she's being rude and expecting kids to avoid her. He's frustrated because her behavior is causing issues. He's trying to address it by pointing out the problem. But is that the right approach? Maybe he's being judgmental about her feelings. Disliking kids isn't inherently wrong, but acting disdainfully in front of others is. However, telling someone their feelings are pathetic could be dismissive and hurtful, even if the behavior is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy has a right to express his concerns, especially since her actions affected others (like putting a baby down and making a mess). But his tone and choice of words might have been harsh. Instead of calling her pathetic, he could have discussed the impact of her actions more constructively. \n\nSo, the question is whether his approach was inconsiderate. The answer depends on whether he's justified in his criticism and how he delivered it. Since he publicly called her out (\"pathetic\") and insulted her edgy image, which might have been a personal attack rather than addressing the specific behavior, he could be seen as in the wrong. But if the behavior was indeed problematic, maybe he's justified. However, the way he framed it as \"pathetic\" and \"pathetic\" might be more about his judgment of her personality rather than the specific incidents. \n\nIn relationships, how you address issues matters. Telling someone their feelings are pathetic is likely hurtful and invalidates her. Even if the behavior needs correction, the method is important. So, the guy's approach might be the issue, making him in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, because he's trying to address a problem. The balance here is tricky. I think the answer is B, meaning he's not in the wrong because he's trying to address her behavior, but his phrasing was poor. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the answer is A for yes, but I think the better answer is B because while his approach could be better, he's not entirely wrong. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is that he's belittling her feelings. Disliking kids is a personal choice, even if her actions are unkind. So telling her it's pathetic might be invalidating. So maybe he is in the wrong (A). But he's also pointing out the negative impact. This is a bit of a toss-up. I need to decide based on the context. The key issue is whether he's justified in calling her feelings pathetic. Disliking kids isn't pathetic, but acting rudely is. He conflated her feelings with her actions. So he's wrong to criticize her feelings as pathetic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
