We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 19. They met on Instagram, she has a grunge/edgy vibe. He's okay with her being edgy and making some cringey comments about the 80s and hating people, but he's upset about her intense dislike for babies and kids. At a family party, she ended up holding a baby while changing a diaper, then put it down and called it a 'gremlin'. She also moved away from his cousin and flicked a blanket. He told her her behavior was ridiculous, and she said kids are disgusting and entitled. He called her out for making everything fit her \"edgy\" narrative, and now she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user wants an A or B answer. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she dislikes kids, acts rude around them (dirty looks, moving away, flicking a blanket), and when forced into a situation with a baby, she mishandled it by putting the baby down in a messy way. The author is upset because her behavior is inconsiderate and rude, and he called her out for it. She responded defensively.\n\nIs the author wrong for telling her her behavior is pathetic and not cool? Well, he's expressing his feelings about her actions. If her behavior was hurtful or inconsiderate, then he's justified in pointing it out. However, the way he communicated it might be an issue. Telling someone their dislike is \"pathetic\" and not \"cool\" could come off as dismissive or condescending. But the main issue is whether her behavior was inappropriate.\n\nHer actions at the family event were inconsiderate. She didn't want to hold the baby but didn't refuse, then acted rudely when handling it. Moving away from the cousin and flicking the blanket are also rude. The author is right to be concerned that she's being inconsiderate towards others, especially in a family setting where kids are present. So he's pointing out valid issues.\n\nHowever, the way he criticized her might be harsh. Calling her hate \"pathetic\" could be seen as attacking her feelings rather than discussing the behavior. It's possible he should have approached the conversation more empathetically, understanding that her dislike for kids might stem from personal issues, but her actions were still inconsiderate.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her that her hate is pathetic and not cool. If her behavior was indeed rude and inconsiderate, then he's justified in expressing his disapproval. However, using judgmental language like \"pathetic\" might not be constructive. Still, the content of his message (that her behavior is inconsiderate) is valid.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inappropriate, and the author had a right to express his concerns. However, he could have handled the communication better. But since the question is about being in the wrong in terms of the situation described, the author isn't wrong for pointing out her inconsiderate behavior. The girlfriend's actions were the issue, not necessarily the author's response.\n"
