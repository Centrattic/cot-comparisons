We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hatred of babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy and his girlfriend have been dating four months. She has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments about hating people and kids. At a family party, she was forced into holding a baby (his sister's new baby) and ended up getting the diaper changed while holding it. When the mom left, she put the baby down on the couch and called it a \"gremlin.\" He finds her behavior rude and obnoxious, especially when she's around kids. He confronted her, and she defended her stance, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for calling her behavior pathetic and not cool. \n\nOn one hand, he's frustrated because her actions were unkind and inconsiderate. He might think she should be more accommodating, especially since she's in a social situation. He's trying to point out that her behavior is immature and not acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, he's criticizing her personal preferences and edgy persona. Maybe he's overstepping by telling her her feelings are pathetic. People can have strong dislikes without being in the wrong. However, her actions (like flicking the blanket, moving away from the kid) might be seen as rude, so he's valid in pointing that out.\n\nBut the key is whether his response was appropriate. Telling someone their dislike is \"pathetic\" can be harsh and dismissive. It's not just about her dislike of kids but how she acted. Maybe he should have focused on her behavior rather than her feelings. Also, their relationship's dynamics matter. He's been dating her four months, so maybe it's too early to judge her personality. However, her actions at the party were problematic, and he's right to address them.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's being disrespectful about her feelings, then maybe A. But if her actions were rude and he's addressing that, then B. The line is between criticizing her feelings vs her actions. The question is whether calling her hate \"pathetic\" is wrong. That's a strong term. Maybe he should have been more understanding of her preferences but still addressed her inconsiderate behavior. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer depends on whether his criticism was justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because her actions were inconsiderate, and he's addressing that. However, the way he phrased it (\"pathetic\") is harsh. But overall, he's not in the wrong for pointing out her behavior was rude.\n"
