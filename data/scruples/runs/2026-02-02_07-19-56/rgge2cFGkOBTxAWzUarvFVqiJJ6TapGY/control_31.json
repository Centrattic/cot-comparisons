We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (TA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's dislike of babies and kids, and how the author called her views \"pathetic\" and told her it doesn't make her cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes comments that the author finds cringey, like hating people and romanticizing the 80s. She also strongly dislikes kids, which the author finds ridiculous. The situation escalates when she's holding a baby at a family party, then puts it down abruptly, causing a mess. The author confronts her, saying her behavior is not cool, and she responds negatively.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Let's analyze both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He's frustrated with her behavior towards kids, which he finds rude and inconsiderate. He thinks she's being immature and that her edgy persona is just a phase. He confronts her, which led to conflict. His reasoning seems to be about respecting others and not being inconsiderate in social settings.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She dislikes kids, which she might see as her personal opinion. Her actions, like moving away from the baby or flicking the blanket, might be seen as childish or inconsiderate, but she might not see it that way. She could feel that her boundaries are being respected, but her expression of them is offensive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did call her views \"pathetic\" and told her she's not cool. That's judgmental and might have been hurtful. However, her behavior was inconsiderate, especially in a family setting where kids are present. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might have been harsh. \n\nBut the question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" If we consider that her behavior was rude and he's addressing it, but his method of confrontation was dismissive and belittling (\"pathetic,\" \"doesn't make you cool\"), then he might be partly at fault for the way he communicated his concerns. However, he's also justified in pointing out her inconsiderate actions.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether he's wrong in telling her that her hate is pathetic. In relationships, it's important to communicate concerns without being judgmental. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his approach was poor. However, the question is a binary choice between A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nGiven that her behavior was inconsiderate and he had a right to express his concerns, even if his wording was harsh, he might not be entirely in the wrong. But if the question is about whether he was wrong to call her views pathetic, then perhaps he was. But the core issue is her behavior, so the author's criticism might be valid, just expressed poorly. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend's dislike of kids is a personal opinion, even if expressed poorly, he shouldn't dismiss it as \"pathetic.\" So maybe the author is in the wrong for the way he phrased it, even if the behavior was wrong.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. The answer hinges on whether the author's criticism was justified in content but not in tone. If the content was valid (her behavior was rude) but the tone was poor (calling her pathetic), then maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if the criticism itself is unwarranted, then he's wrong. \n\nGiven that her actions were inconsiderate and he's addressing them, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). However, his phrasing could be seen as dismissive and not constructive, which might make him wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong in general. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because while his approach could have been better, the content of his criticism isn't entirely without merit. Her behavior was inconsiderate, and he had a right to express that. The main issue is the way he expressed it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the communication style. So he's not in the wrong for expressing his concerns, even if his method was harsh.\n"
