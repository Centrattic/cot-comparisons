We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hatred towards babies is pathetic and not cool. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for four months. She has an edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments, which he finds cringe but manageable. However, her dislike for babies and kids is more problematic. She avoids them, gives dirty looks, and in a family party incident, she ended up holding a baby, got upset, and acted inconsiderately by putting the baby down on the couch when the parent wasn't there, causing a mess. He criticizes her for being rude and expecting that kids should avoid her.\n\nThe author's main concern is that her behavior is unacceptable and he told her she's wrong. The question is whether he was wrong for doing that. \n\nHmm. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like moving away from a child, flicking a blanket, and reacting poorly to holding a baby\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate and rude. The author was frustrated and expressed his feelings, which is a valid reaction. However, the way he criticized her might have been harsh. He called her hate \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool or edgy,\" which could come across as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he had the right to express his dissatisfaction with her behavior, especially since it caused issues in a family setting. However, maybe the approach was too direct or condescending. The key is whether his criticism was justified. Her actions were indeed problematic, so pointing that out isn't wrong. However, the manner in which he delivered the criticism might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe that the girlfriend's dislike of babies isn't his issue to correct, or that he should have handled it more delicately. On the other hand, the author is within his rights to address behavior that affects their relationship or social interactions. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because he's addressing a real issue that impacts their interactions. However, the way he communicated it could be improved. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and since he had a valid reason to express his concerns, the answer leans towards B. The girlfriend's behavior was objectively inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong for addressing it. However, the tone might be an issue, but that doesn't mean he's entirely wrong.\n"
