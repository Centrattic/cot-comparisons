We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong, with options A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, the author (18M) is dating a 19-year-old girlfriend. She has an edgy, grunge aesthetic and makes comments about hating people and life being better in the 80s. He finds her edgelord comments cringe but manageable. The main issue is her intense dislike for babies and kids. She avoids being around them, makes excuses, and was rude when holding a baby at a family party, even calling it a \"gremlin.\" The author is upset because she didn't handle the situation better and told her her behavior is ridiculous. Now, she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to address her behavior, which he finds inappropriate. He feels she's being rude and not considering others. But is he wrong for pointing that out?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's dislike of kids is a personal preference. She may not like them, and while her actions (like flicking a blanket or moving away) might be inconsiderate, it's not necessarily wrong for her to have such a preference. The author is criticizing her for things that aren't inherently harmful, just maybe socially awkward. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid if he feels her behavior is offensive or hurtful, but he's also making assumptions about her motives (like thinking she's in an emo phase). However, in a relationship, it's okay to discuss issues that affect the relationship or social interactions. The key point is whether the author's response was justified. He's not aggressive but expressed his concerns. The girlfriend's reaction might be defensive, but that doesn't make the author wrong for addressing the issue.\n\nHowever, the line between expressing concern and being judgmental can be thin. The author called her behavior \"ridiculous\" and \"pathetic,\" which might be harsh. But in the context of a relationship, discussing such things is part of being in a partnership. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for speaking up. The girlfriend's actions might be immature, but the author has the right to express his concerns. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
