We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hatred of babies is pathetic and not cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend has a strong dislike for babies and kids, which is causing issues in social settings. The author is frustrated because she acts rudely around children, like giving dirty looks, moving away, and even putting a baby down in a messy way. He confronts her, calling her behavior pathetic, which leads to her feeling offended.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and communication. The author is expressing his feelings about her behavior, which he finds unacceptable. But the way he does it might be dismissive or harsh. He mentions she has social anxiety and maybe doesn't know how to handle these situations properly. However, telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" could be seen as invalidating her emotions. Even if her actions are inappropriate, attacking her feelings in a derogatory way isn't helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is indeed problematic. She's been rude to children, which is unkind and inconsiderate. The author has a right to be upset because her actions reflect poorly on him and cause discomfort for others. But the way he addresses it\u2014calling her views \"pathetic\" and \"stupid edgy\"\u2014might come off as condescending. It's possible that he should have approached the conversation more constructively, focusing on how her actions affect him and others rather than belittling her feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's own social anxiety. Maybe she's struggling with handling these situations and the author's harsh criticism isn't helping. Effective communication in a relationship involves understanding both sides. Even if her behavior is off, the author could have expressed his concerns without dismissing her entirely.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not entirely in the wrong, especially since his girlfriend's actions are clearly problematic. However, his approach in addressing it might be part of the issue. The answer hinges on whether being direct and critical is acceptable in this context. The question is whether his criticism was valid or not. Given that he's pointing out her inconsiderate behavior, he's justified in expressing his concerns. But the way he did it might be unkind. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but upon analysis, there's a balance here. The author's right to voice his concerns but needs a better approach. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could improve.\n"
