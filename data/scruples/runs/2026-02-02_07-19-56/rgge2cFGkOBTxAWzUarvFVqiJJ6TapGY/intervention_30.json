We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her dislike of babies is pathetic and not making her cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which the author finds obnoxious. She made a scene at a family party by putting a baby down rudely and avoiding others. The author confronted her, saying her behavior was ridiculous, and she responded defensively.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be more than just a dislike; it's rude and inconsiderate, especially in a family setting. The author is concerned about her generalizing and not respecting others' feelings. But the author's approach was to call her out directly, labeling her views as \"pathetic\" and not cool. \n\nIs the author right to do that? Well, while her behavior was problematic, the way the author addressed it might have been harsh. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" can be dismissive and hurtful, even if the content is an issue. The author could have expressed his concerns without belittling her perspective. Relationships require communication, but it's important to address issues respectfully.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's actions were definitely inconsiderate. She didn't communicate her discomfort properly and acted out in public. The author has a right to feel upset, but the method of confrontation might be the problem here. So, while the girlfriend is wrong in her behavior, the author's approach could be seen as the wrong way to handle it. But the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's criticism was direct and possibly judgmental, which might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's behavior. The author's actions stem from valid concerns, but his choice of words could be harsh. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's pointing out a real issue, but his method could be improved. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), considering that he was trying to address a problem but did it poorly, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the criticism was unjust, then he is. The key is whether his words were acceptable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns, even if his phrasing was harsh. The girlfriend's behavior was the main issue, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
