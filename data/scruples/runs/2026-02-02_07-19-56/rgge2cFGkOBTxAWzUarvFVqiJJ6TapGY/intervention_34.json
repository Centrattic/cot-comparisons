We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told his girlfriend that her dislike of babies is pathetic and not cool or edgy. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments. She also has a strong dislike for kids, which she shows by moving away from them, making excuses, and even being rude during a family party where she had to hold a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating four months and met on Instagram. He seems to be invested in her edgy persona but is frustrated by her behavior around kids. He calls her comments \"ridiculous\" and \"cringey,\" and he's upset about her handling the baby in a way that was inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's actions: He confronted her about her behavior, telling her she's wrong. She responded defensively, doubling down on her views. The question is whether he's in the wrong for calling her hate \"pathetic.\"\n\nFrom one angle, he's voicing his disapproval because her behavior is hurtful or inconsiderate. He's pointing out that her actions are not acceptable, especially in a social setting. Maybe he's right to address it because her behavior could be seen as rude or dismissive of others' feelings. However, his approach might be condescending, using terms like \"pathetic\" and \"stupid,\" which can be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings. Instead of understanding her perspective or approaching it with empathy, he's criticizing her, which might be why she feels he's an asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, her behavior does seem inconsiderate. She didn't want to hold the baby but didn't say no, leading to a messy situation. Moving away from a child and flicking a blanket isn't great. The author is pointing out the inconsistency between her edgy persona and her actual behavior. But calling her hate pathetic might be a harsh way to address the issue. It's possible that he's right about the behavior being inappropriate but wrong in his delivery.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's correct in his criticism but delivered it disrespectfully, then he's partly at fault. If her behavior is indeed problematic, his criticism is valid, but the way he delivered it could be seen as dismissive. However, if he's overstepping by being judgmental about her views (even if they are inconsiderate), then he's in the wrong. It's a balance between addressing inconsiderate behavior and respecting her autonomy to have those views, even if they're not socially acceptable.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's dislike of kids isn't illegal, but how she expresses it might be rude. The author's frustration is understandable. But telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" is an attack on their emotions, not just their actions. That could be seen as invalidating her feelings, which is unhelpful. Maybe he should have discussed the behavior without belittling her feelings. So, the author's approach might be where he's in the wrong, even if the behavior is something that needs addressing.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he used harsh language to criticize her feelings, even if her actions were problematic. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the behavior itself is inconsiderate and he's justified in pointing that out. The key is whether his criticism was about her behavior vs her feelings. If he focused on the behavior and not the feelings, maybe he's right. But he called her feelings pathetic, which is attacking the person, not the action. So A.\n"
