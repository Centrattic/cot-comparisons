  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?\nI (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author confronting his girlfriend over her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend doesn't like kids and shows her dislike in public, like moving away from a baby, using her fingers to pass a blanket, and even leaving a baby on a couch during a diaper change. The author thinks she's being obnoxious and tells her she's wrong. She then calls him an asshole.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Well, it's a relationship issue, so both might have valid points. The girlfriend has a right to her dislike of kids, but her actions are rude and dismissive. The author is frustrated because her behavior is causing issues in social settings. \n\nThe author's criticism might be valid because her actions are inconsiderate. But the way he told her off could come off as condescending, especially if he dismissed her feelings or her edgy persona. However, the girlfriend's behavior is clearly inconsiderate towards others, especially in family events. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have approached the situation without understanding her reasons, leading to conflict. But her behavior is objectively inconsiderate. So, it's a balance. The question is whether the author is wrong for pointing out her inconsiderate actions. Since she was being rude, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expressing his concern. But he could have handled it better. However, the main issue is her actions, so the author isn't the one at fault here.\n"
