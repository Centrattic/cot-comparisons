We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting his girlfriend about her dislike for babies and children, which he finds obnoxious.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has expressed a strong dislike for kids, which includes avoiding them, making derogatory remarks, and acting rudely around them. The author is upset with her behavior at a family party where she was uncooperative and inconsiderate. He called out her behavior as ridiculous and criticized her for expecting others to keep their kids away from her.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were clearly inconsiderate and disrespectful. She didn't communicate her discomfort, leading to a situation where she was forced (due to social anxiety) to hold a baby and then reacted poorly. The author was within his right to express his disappointment, especially since her behavior affected others at the gathering. However, the way he did it\u2014calling her behavior \"ridiculous\" and dismissing her edgy narrative\u2014could be seen as condescending. But the core issue is her inconsiderate actions towards others' children. So, the author's criticism is justified, but the tone might be harsh. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions were problematic, the author isn't wrong for pointing it out, even if his approach could be improved. So the answer is B.\n"
