We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend strongly dislikes babies and kids, and the author confronts her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thinks his girlfriend's behavior is rude and childish, especially when she's around children. She has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes comments that seem cringe. The girlfriend's actions, like avoiding her sister and mishandling a baby at a party, have caused conflict.\n\nThe author called her behavior pathetic and not cool, which upset her. Now, is the author wrong for doing that? Well, the girlfriend's actions are definitely problematic. She didn't respect the baby's mother, acted unkindly, and maybe even endangered the baby by putting it down mid-diaper change. That's not okay.\n\nHowever, how the author addressed the issue might be an issue. Telling someone their dislike is \"pathetic\" could be harsh, even if the behavior is wrong. It's possible that the author could have handled the conversation more compassionately, discussing the impact of her actions rather than belittling her feelings.\n\nBut the girlfriend's behavior is clearly the main problem here. The author was trying to make her see that her actions are not acceptable. While the approach could have been better, the author isn't entirely wrong in pointing out the issue. The key is whether the criticism was valid or not. Since her actions were rude and inconsiderate, the author is justified in addressing it.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
