We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for criticizing their girlfriend's dislike of babies. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which the author finds problematic. The author mentions instances where she was rude around babies, like moving away from a cousin and mishandling a baby at a family party. The author confronted her about it, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's behavior: avoiding kids is one thing, but acting rudely in public family gatherings, especially with a baby, is a red flag. The author's frustration is understandable, as it's impolite and unkind. However, the author's response was to call her actions \"pathetic\" and \"edgy,\" which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe girlfriend's dislike of kids might stem from personal preferences or anxiety. The author's approach was to criticize her behavior directly, which might not be the best way to address the issue. Instead of supporting her feelings or discussing boundaries, he judged her. That could have been hurtful, especially if she's already uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions at the party were unkind and inconsiderate. Publicly shaming someone might not be the solution, but the author's criticism isn't entirely without merit. The key point is whether the author's response was appropriate. Insulting her personality and calling her edgy could have been more hurtful than helpful. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for the way he handled it, not necessarily the content. Calling someone's feelings \"pathetic\" is harsh. The right approach would be to discuss the issue calmly, set boundaries, and find a compromise. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his method of addressing her behavior was dismissive and unkind.\n"
