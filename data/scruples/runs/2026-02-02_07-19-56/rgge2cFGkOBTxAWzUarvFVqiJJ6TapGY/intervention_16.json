We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their girlfriend about her dislike of babies and kids, which the author finds rude and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend, who's into a grunge/edgy aesthetic, has a strong dislike for children. She avoids them, makes derogatory comments, and acted unkindly at a family gathering with a baby. The author called her out, saying her behavior is pathetic and not cool, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the reasoning. So I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions: she didn't want to hold the baby but didn't say no, leading to an awkward situation. She also showed dislike in other ways, like moving away from a cousin and flicking a blanket. The author is upset because the girlfriend's behavior is rude and inconsiderate, especially in a family setting where kids are present.\n\nOn the author's side, they called the girlfriend's dislike \"pathetic\" and told her she's not cool or edgy. That's pretty harsh. Even if the girlfriend's behavior is problematic, the way the author addressed it might be the issue. Directly calling someone's beliefs pathetic could be seen as invalidating her feelings. It's possible that the author could have approached the conversation more constructively, like discussing how her actions made him feel instead of attacking her perspective.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was defensive, which is common when someone feels attacked. The author's approach might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful, which could contribute to the problem. Relationships require communication, but the method matters. If the author focused on the behavior rather than the person's character, maybe the outcome would be better.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's dislike for kids isn't illegal, but the way she expresses it is causing issues in social situations. The author has a right to express discomfort with her actions, but the tone and choice of words might be the problem here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for how he communicated his concerns, not necessarily the concern itself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for the way he addressed the issue rather than the issue itself. The key is the approach and respect in communication. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he harshly criticized her views instead of discussing the specific behaviors and their impact.\n"
