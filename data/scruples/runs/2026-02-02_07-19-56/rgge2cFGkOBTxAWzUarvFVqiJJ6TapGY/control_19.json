We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend's dislike of babies and kids, and the author confronting her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend's behavior: she hates babies, avoids them, makes rude comments, and acted poorly at a family party. The author is frustrated because her behavior is inconsiderate and rude, especially in front of family. He called her behavior pathetic and not cool, which led to tension.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The girlfriend's actions are clearly causing discomfort, especially when she had to hold the baby and then acted out. The author's response was to tell her she's wrong and that her hate isn't making her cool. But was that justified?\n\nThe author's criticism is about her behavior, which could be seen as valid because being rude to kids, especially in front of family, is problematic. However, the way he addressed it might have been harsh. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" could be seen as invalidating. Healthy relationships require communication, but the approach matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions are indeed inconsiderate. She didn't handle the situation well when she had to hold the baby and then reacted negatively. Her justification of using an \"edgy\" narrative might not excuse the behavior. The author is pointing out that she needs to consider others' feelings and not impose her dislike on others.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's pointing out valid issues with her behavior. However, his method of confronting her might not have been the best. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wrong is about being harsh, maybe. Alternatively, if the wrong is about being right to address the issue, then maybe not.\n\nThe main issue is that her actions were rude and inconsiderate, so the author is justified in addressing them. The way he did it might be a separate issue, but the question is about being in the wrong regarding the situation, not the communication style. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because he's addressing valid concerns about her behavior.\n"
