We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hate for babies is pathetic and not cool/edgy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments, but her behavior towards babies is extreme. She avoids them, gives dirty looks, and acted rudely at a family party. The author confronted her, and she's upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, respect, and communication. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014acting rudely towards family members' children, creating a mess, and being inconsiderate. The author is frustrated because she didn't handle the situation appropriately, like declining to hold the baby politely. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her that her hate is pathetic and not edgy. While her behavior is unkind, does calling it \"pathetic\" and dismissing her edgy persona cross a line? The author is expressing his opinion, but he's not attacking her character directly. However, using terms like \"pathetic\" can be hurtful and might come off as condescending. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful, so the author has valid reasons to be upset. The main issue is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to address the problem. Telling someone their views are pathetic might not be the best approach, but it's a form of criticism rather than abuse. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it would be because he was harsh in his criticism. If B (no), it's because her behavior was clearly problematic and he had the right to express his disapproval. \n\nConsidering that the girlfriend's actions were objectively inconsiderate and the author is trying to address the issue, even if his wording was harsh, it's more about communication style than being entirely in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
