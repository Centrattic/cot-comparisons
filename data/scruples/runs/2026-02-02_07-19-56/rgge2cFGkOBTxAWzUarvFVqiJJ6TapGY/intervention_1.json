We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author confronting their girlfriend over her dislike of babies, which they find unreasonable. The girlfriend has an edgy persona, makes cringe comments, and acts unkindly around children. The author is upset because she didn't handle situations better, like holding the baby without being asked and being rude. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's behavior includes moving away from kids, making excuses, and acting rudely. The author confronts her, calling her actions pathetic and not cool. The girlfriend responds defensively. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's criticism is about how the girlfriend handles her dislike for babies. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as judgmental or unkind. The author is trying to point out the inconsistency between her edgy image and real-world actions. However, the author's approach might have been confrontational. The girlfriend also has social anxiety, which might have contributed to her not saying no properly. \n\nIs the author wrong for pointing out her behavior? The author's concern is valid because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But the way the author confronted her\u2014calling her actions \"pathetic\" and invalidating her edgy persona\u2014might have been harsh. The girlfriend's responses indicate defensiveness, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. However, the author should consider the girlfriend's anxiety and communicate more compassionately. \n\nIn such situations, it's important to address concerns but also consider the other person's feelings. The author's intent was to correct behavior, but the method might have been too direct. So, the author isn't entirely wrong but could have handled it better. However, the core issue is about the girlfriend's behavior, which the author is justified in addressing. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
