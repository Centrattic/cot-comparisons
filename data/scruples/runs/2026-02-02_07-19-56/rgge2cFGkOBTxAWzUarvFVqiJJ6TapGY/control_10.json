We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who has a strong dislike for babies and kids, which the author criticizes as pathetic and not making her cool or edgy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend has an aversion to kids, which the author finds problematic, especially when she acted disrespectfully around a baby during a family event. The author is upset because her behavior was rude and she didn't handle the situation appropriately. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to be using her \"edgy\" persona as a justification for her actions.\n\nNow, considering the social norms and expectations in a relationship. It's common for people to have different opinions or preferences, but when those opinions lead to disrespectful behavior towards others, it can become an issue. The girlfriend's actions\u2014moving away from a child, flicking a baby's blanket, and reacting negatively to holding a baby\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a family setting where such interactions are expected. The author's frustration stems from her not taking responsibility for her actions and instead doubling down on her edgy narrative.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to call her actions pathetic and not cool. This could be seen as dismissive of her feelings or the reasons behind her aversion. Maybe there's an underlying reason for her dislike that isn't addressed here. But in the situation described, her behavior was publicly rude, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is pointing out the girlfriend's disrespectful behavior and expressing that it's not acceptable. It's reasonable for the author to address this, especially if it affects their relationship or interactions with family. However, the way the author communicated their concerns\u2014calling her actions pathetic\u2014might have been harsh and not the most constructive approach. But the core issue is the girlfriend's behavior, which the author is justified in addressing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had no right to criticize her for personal preferences, but in this case, the actions affected others (like getting the couch dirty) and were disrespectful. So the author isn't entirely wrong in pointing this out. The girlfriend's response of calling the author an asshole is a red flag, indicating a lack of willingness to address the issue maturely.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns about the girlfriend's behavior, which was inconsiderate. The answer is B.\n"
