We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about him confronting his girlfriend for her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds rude and inconsiderate. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an aversion to kids, which she expresses through behavior like moving away, making negative comments, and acting unkindly when handling a baby. The author feels she's being inconsiderate and called her out for it. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, everyone has different preferences. Disliking babies isn't inherently wrong, but acting in a way that's rude or hurtful might be. The girlfriend's actions, like flicking a blanket or leaving a baby unattended, could be seen as disrespectful and inconsiderate towards others, especially in a family setting. The author is pointing out that her behavior is causing problems and that she should take responsibility for her actions.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might be an issue. Telling someone their dislike of babies is \"pathetic\" and not \"cool or edgy\" could come off as dismissive and condescending. Instead of addressing the behavior, he's attacking her preferences, which might be why she feels he's an asshole. It's possible that he could have approached the conversation more constructively, focusing on how her actions affect others rather than belittling her tastes. \n\nBut the key points here are the specific actions the girlfriend took. Leaving a baby unattended, getting a couch dirty, and handling a baby carelessly are problematic. The author is correct in pointing out that her behavior was inconsiderate. However, the way he framed the criticism might have been harsh. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the girlfriend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author is right to address it. However, his method of calling her preferences \"pathetic\" and dismissive of her personality could be seen as condescending. The balance here is tricky. If the author is trying to address real inconsiderate actions but uses a demeaning approach, he's not entirely without fault. But the core issue is the behavior, not just the preferences. \n\nI think the main problem is the girlfriend's actions, not the author's criticism of her preferences. He's pointing out valid concerns about her behavior, but his phrasing might have been unhelpful. But given that the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer might hinge on intent and approach. However, since the author is addressing the behavior (even if his tone was harsh), he's not necessarily in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong), because the behavior is the issue, and he's justified in pointing that out, even if his approach could be better.\n"
