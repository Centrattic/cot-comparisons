We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves his girlfriend's behavior towards babies and kids. She has a strong dislike for them, which he finds unreasonable and rude.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a history of making edgy comments and acting negatively around kids. At a family party, she ended up holding a baby during a diaper change and then put it down on the couch when the mom left, causing a mess. She also avoided a cousin and flicked a blanket. The author confronts her, saying her behavior is pathetic and not cool, leading her to think he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to call her out. The girlfriend's actions were rude and inconsiderate, especially around family and a newborn. The author is pointing out that her behavior is unreasonable and that she should take responsibility if she doesn't want to be around kids. However, he might be in the wrong if he's being judgmental without considering her feelings or the root of her dislike. \n\nBut given that she made excuses like kids being dirty and feral, and her actions at the party were inconsiderate, the author's criticism seems justified. He's encouraging her to be more respectful and responsible. However, the way he phrased it as \"pathetic\" might be harsh, but the core issue is her behavior being rude. So the author's actions might not be wrong, but maybe his approach could be better. But since the options are A or B, and the key is whether he's in the wrong, the answer seems to be B (No).\n"
