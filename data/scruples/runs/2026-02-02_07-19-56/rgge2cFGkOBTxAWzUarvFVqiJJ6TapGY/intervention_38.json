We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for criticizing his girlfriend's dislike of babies. The situation involves the girlfriend's strong aversion to kids, which the author finds unreasonable and rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a consistent aversion to babies and kids, which she might view as part of her personality or edgy aesthetic. The author, on the other hand, feels that her behavior is unacceptable, especially when she handles a baby without care, leading to a mess, and acts dismissively around children.\n\nThe key points are the author's actions: he told her that her hate for babies is \"pathetic\" and doesn't make her cool or edgy. That's pretty harsh. Even if he's frustrated, calling someone's feelings \"pathetic\" is a strong judgment. It's important to note that people can have valid reasons for not liking children, though it's uncommon. The author's approach was to criticize her feelings directly, which might have been dismissive of her perspective.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions at the party\u2014putting down the baby, moving away from the cousin, flicking the blanket\u2014seem inconsiderate. But the author's response was to accuse her of being pathetic, which could come off as invalidating her feelings. Healthy relationships require communication and understanding, so maybe the author should have discussed his concerns without belittling her.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was rude, and the author has a right to express his discomfort with her actions. However, the way he did it might have been the problem. Instead of calling her feelings pathetic, he could have addressed the specific behaviors without attacking her personality.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, while her actions were rude, the way he responded by labeling her feelings as pathetic is likely the issue here. He should have communicated his concerns more constructively. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because his response was harsh and dismissive. But I need to check if there's a balance here. Maybe both have some responsibility. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author's criticism was valid but delivered poorly, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, calling someone's feelings \"pathetic\" is a strong term and can be seen as attacking her rather than discussing the issue. So, leaning towards A.\n"
