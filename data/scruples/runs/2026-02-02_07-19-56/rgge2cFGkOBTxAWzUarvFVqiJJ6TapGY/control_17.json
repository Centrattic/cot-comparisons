We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for criticizing his girlfriend's dislike of babies. The situation involves the girlfriend acting negatively around kids, and the author confronting her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to babies and kids, which she's expressed through actions like avoiding them, giving dirty looks, and even making derogatory comments. The author feels this behavior is rude and unrealistic, especially when she ends up holding a baby and then reacting negatively in a family setting.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The girlfriend's actions during the family party were clearly disruptive and disrespectful. She didn't communicate her discomfort properly, leading to a messy situation. The author's reaction was to point out that her behavior is unreasonable and that it's not acceptable to expect others to avoid her. \n\nHowever, the way the author approached the conversation might matter. If he was confrontational or dismissive of her feelings without understanding the root cause of her aversion (like social anxiety or past experiences), that could be problematic. But based on the description, he tried to express his frustration about her actions being rude and unrealistic, which is a valid concern, especially in a family setting where such behavior could cause tension.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification using an \"edgy\" attitude might be a way to deflect her actual feelings, but the author is right to point out that her actions were inconsiderate. The author isn't wrong for wanting her to be more respectful and communicative. However, he might need to approach the issue with more empathy and understanding, considering her social anxiety mentioned. But in this case, the immediate situation involved her not handling the baby situation well and being disrespectful, so his frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns, especially since her actions were objectively inconsiderate. The answer should be B (No).\n"
