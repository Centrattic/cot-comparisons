We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author confronting their girlfriend over her dislike of babies and kids, which they find rude and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which manifests in her behavior. The author feels she's being too harsh and inconsiderate, especially in social situations. The key points here are the girlfriend's actions: moving away from kids, making derogatory comments, and the incident at the family party where she left a baby unattended, causing a mess. The author called her out for being \"pathetic\" and not edgy, leading to conflict.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior might stem from social anxiety or past experiences, but the author finds it unacceptable. The question is whether the author was wrong to confront her. On one hand, the author has a right to address behavior they find offensive. On the other hand, the way they phrased their criticism (\"pathetic\") might have been harsh and dismissive, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings. However, the girlfriend also made excuses and didn't take responsibility for her actions.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's criticism was justified given the context. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so pointing that out isn't wrong. The author's approach might have been harsh, but the core issue is valid. The answer would depend on whether the criticism was constructive. The author's main point about not respecting others' needs (like holding the baby) is valid, so they aren't in the wrong for addressing it. The girlfriend's response was defensive, but that's on her side. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
