  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?\nI (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting his girlfriend about her dislike of babies, which he finds obnoxious. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a strong aversion to children, which might stem from her edgy persona. The author is upset because she didn't handle a situation at a family party well\u2014specifically, putting a baby down abruptly and acting rudely. He criticizes her behavior, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the possible viewpoints. The author might have a valid concern. It's reasonable for someone to be upset if their partner acts disrespectfully toward others, especially in a family setting. However, the boyfriend could be in the wrong if he dismissed her feelings without understanding. Maybe her anxiety or discomfort around babies isn't just \"edgy\" but has a basis she hasn't communicated. He might have criticized her without considering her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions, like moving away from children and handling the baby's blanket poorly, could be seen as rude. The author's frustration is understandable. But was his approach appropriate? Telling her her feelings are \"pathetic\" and not cool might be hurtful, even if he's right about her behavior being obnoxious. The way he communicated his concerns could have been more empathetic.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's excuse about social anxiety might be a factor. If she felt pressured to hold the baby and didn't know how to say no, the author might have been too quick to judge her instead of supporting her in that situation.\n\nI need to weigh the criticism of her behavior against the manner in which he addressed it. The key is whether the author overstepped by belittling her feelings. If he's right about her actions being rude but wrong in his approach, maybe both are at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his criticism was valid and his tone appropriate, then he isn't in the wrong. But if he dismissed her feelings and didn't consider her perspective, he might be partially at fault.\n\nGiven that the author says her behavior was \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool,\" which are judgmental, it suggests he might have been condescending. People can have valid reasons for their dislikes, and the way he communicated his disapproval could be the issue. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he invalidated her feelings instead of discussing them constructively.\n"
