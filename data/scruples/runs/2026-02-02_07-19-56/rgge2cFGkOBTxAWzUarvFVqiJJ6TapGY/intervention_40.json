We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their girlfriend about her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds obnoxious and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she actively avoids kids, makes derogatory comments, and acted rudely during a family event. The author feels she should be more respectful and considerate, especially in social settings. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees her dislike for kids as part of her edgy personality and feels justified in her actions.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and social etiquette. The author is upset because their girlfriend's actions are not just dislike but active disdain and rudeness. For example, she left a baby on a couch during a diaper change, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, handling the blanket with two fingers and flicking it over is a clear sign of disdain. These actions could be hurtful to others, especially family members.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her that her attitude is \"pathetic\" and not making her cool. That's harsh, but is it in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's behavior does cross into rudeness, so the author has a point in addressing it. However, the way he did it might have been confrontational. Instead of calling her actions pathetic, he could have expressed his concerns more calmly. That said, the girlfriend's behavior is problematic regardless of how the author confronts her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's criticism is valid because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, the way he delivered the criticism might have been unkind. But the main issue is her behavior, not necessarily his method of addressing it. In relationships, open communication is important, but the content of his message was harsh. However, the girlfriend's actions were the root problem. So, while the author's approach could be improved, he's not entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's behavior was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
