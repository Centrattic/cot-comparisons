We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend her dislike of babies is pathetic and not making her cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The girlfriend has a strong dislike for babies and kids, which the author finds annoying. The girlfriend's behavior at a family party included being rude around the baby and the cousin. The author confronts her, and she responds defensively, sticking to her edgy narrative. The author then calls her hate pathetic and not making her cool.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. In a relationship, both partners should respect each other's views even if they disagree. The author's issue is with her behavior, but calling her feelings \"pathetic\" and dismissing her edgy persona as not making her cool could be seen as condescending. The author might be right in thinking her behavior is inconsiderate, but the way they addressed it might have been harsh. The girlfriend's actions were rude, but the author's response could be seen as invalidating her feelings without addressing the actual behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's girlfriend's actions (moving away from the cousin, flicking the blanket) were inconsiderate. The author has a valid point about needing to interact with kids in life. However, telling someone their feelings are pathetic isn't productive. The author could have addressed the behavior without belittling her personality.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's actions were definitely problematic, the author's approach in confronting her might have been too harsh and dismissive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their response, even if their concerns were valid.\n"
