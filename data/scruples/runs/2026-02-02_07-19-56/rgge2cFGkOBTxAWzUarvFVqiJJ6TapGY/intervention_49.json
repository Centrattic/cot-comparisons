We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for confronting his girlfriend about her dislike of babies. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to babies and kids, even going as far as to act rudely around them. The guy found her behavior unacceptable, especially when she left a baby unattended and made a mess. He confronted her, calling her behavior pathetic and not cool. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions include giving dirty looks, avoiding contact with her sister, and being rude during a family event. The guy feels that her behavior is not only uncool but also inconsiderate. He expects her to handle such situations more maturely, like declining politely instead of acting out.\n\nNow, is the guy in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to want a partner to be respectful, especially in family settings. However, he might have been harsh in his wording (\"pathetic\", \"doesn't make her cool\") which could be hurtful. But considering her actions were problematic, his concern is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is indeed problematic. Discomfort around kids is one thing, but being rude and inconsiderate is another. The guy's criticism is about her actions, not just her preferences. So, while his approach might have been a bit harsh, his intent was to address actual issues. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy had a valid reason to talk to her about her behavior. However, the way he delivered it could have been more constructive. That said, the core issue is her inappropriate actions, so the guy isn't wrong for addressing it. \n\nI think the main point is whether her behavior was wrong. Since it was, the guy's criticism is justified, even if the delivery could be better. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
