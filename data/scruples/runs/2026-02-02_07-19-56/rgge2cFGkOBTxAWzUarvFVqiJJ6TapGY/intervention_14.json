We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's dislike of babies and kids, her behavior at a family event, and the author confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to children, which the author finds rude. She avoids them, makes negative comments, and in a family gathering, she ended up holding a baby, then quickly put it down in a messy way and called it a \"gremlin.\" The author feels she should have declined to hold the baby or asked for help, and he called her behavior ridiculous and pathetic. Now the girlfriend thinks he's an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The girlfriend's dislike of kids is part of her personality, but her actions at the family event were inconsiderate. However, the author's response was to criticize her, calling her views pathetic and not cool. That's harsh. Even if her behavior was rude, the way the author confronted her might be the issue. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" is a strong and judgmental statement. It's not just about her actions but also about the way he expressed his disapproval. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's social anxiety might play a role in why she didn't say no. She felt forced into the situation and then reacted poorly. The author might have been right to address her behavior, but his approach was confrontational and dismissive. The question is whether he's in the wrong for his response. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate concerns without belittling the other person. The author could have discussed his feelings without attacking her character. By calling her views pathetic, he's invalidating her feelings, which can be hurtful. So, while the girlfriend's actions were inappropriate, the author's method of addressing it might have been wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was harsh and unconstructive.\n"
