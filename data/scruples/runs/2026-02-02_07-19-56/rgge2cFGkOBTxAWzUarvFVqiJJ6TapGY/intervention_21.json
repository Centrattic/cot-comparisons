We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author confronting their girlfriend about her dislike of babies and kids, which they find ridiculous and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has an aversion to babies and kids, which she's expressed through her actions\u2014moving away, giving dirty looks, and even being rude in a family gathering. The author is upset because her behavior is not only about dislike but also includes rudeness and a lack of consideration for others, like putting a baby down in a messy way and using two fingers to pass a blanket. The author told her she's being pathetic and that her behavior doesn't make her cool or edgy. The girlfriend then called the author an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's actions do seem inconsiderate and potentially hurtful. The author is trying to address her behavior, which could be necessary for maintaining a healthy relationship. It's reasonable for the author to express that they find her actions inappropriate, especially in social settings where others might be uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might be harsh. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" and not \"cool or edgy\" could come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's dislike of kids is a personal preference, and while acting on that in a rude manner is wrong, calling her feelings pathetic might not be constructive. The author could have approached the issue with more empathy, understanding possible reasons for her aversion (like past experiences or anxiety), and discussed boundaries instead of publicly criticizing her.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is the behavior, not the feelings. The author is right to point out that the girlfriend's actions (not just her feelings) are problematic. Rudeness and entitlement are valid concerns. The author's frustration is justified because the girlfriend isn't considering others' feelings, especially in family settings. The way the author communicated their concerns might have been harsh, but the underlying message\u2014that her actions are unacceptable\u2014is valid.\n\nSo, the author is addressing a legitimate issue. While the delivery could have been improved, the core of the concern isn't without merit. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
