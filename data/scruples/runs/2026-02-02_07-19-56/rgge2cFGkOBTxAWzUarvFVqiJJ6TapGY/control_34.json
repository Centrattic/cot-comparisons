We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who hates babies and kids, and the author is upset with how she behaves around them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend has an \"edgy\" persona, which includes hating kids and acting negatively around them. The author is frustrated because her behavior is rude and inconsiderate, especially in social situations like a family party. The key incidents are the baby incident where she left the baby on the couch during a diaper change, moving away from a kid, and flicking a blanket. The author confronted her, calling her behavior pathetic and not cool, and now the girlfriend thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for telling her that her hate for babies is pathetic. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing his feelings about her behavior. It's his right to feel that her actions were inappropriate, especially in a family setting. He's pointing out her inconsiderate actions and that her edgy persona is childish. People have different boundaries, but being rude to kids, especially when they're not the one's fault, can be seen as uncalled for. The author might have a valid point about her needing to be more considerate, especially in social situations where she's expected to interact with others' family members.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping by calling her behavior \"pathetic\" and not cool. Everyone has different preferences, and while hating kids is one thing, acting inconsiderately is another. But the way he criticized her could be harsh. He might not have considered her feelings or the reasons behind her dislike. Also, she has social anxiety, which he mentions as a possible factor in her not saying no to holding the baby. Maybe he should have been more empathetic in his approach instead of being dismissive.\n\nBut then again, she did act obnoxiously. Leaving the baby during a diaper change was irresponsible. Her behavior was clearly inconsiderate, and the author has the right to express his disapproval. However, the way he phrased it might be the problem. Instead of being constructive, he called her views pathetic, which could be seen as an attack on her personality rather than her specific actions.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior is a long-standing issue, not just a one-time thing. The author tried to address it after multiple incidents, which is understandable. However, the tone of his confrontation might have been the issue. He might have needed to approach it more gently, perhaps discussing how her actions made him feel and the impact on others rather than dismissing her views outright.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to be polite even if you dislike someone or something. Her behavior was unkind, and the author's frustration is valid. However, the manner in which he confronted her could be seen as confrontational and disrespectful, which might justify her feeling hurt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his feelings about her behavior. However, the way he did it could have been more respectful. The question is whether he is in the wrong for his actions. Since he's voicing his concerns, even if harshly, it's part of a relationship. But if he was abusive or overly harsh, that could be a problem. The line is thin here.\n\nThe key points are that she acted inconsiderately, and he had the right to address it. However, his choice of words was harsh, which might have been unkind. So, while his intent wasn't wrong, his approach could be criticized. But in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about whether his actions crossed a line. Since he's expressing his opinion and his feelings, he's not in the wrong for doing so, even if his words were harsh. Alternatively, if the question is about whether he was right to criticize her, but the answer is about if he was in the wrong, then maybe B is the answer. But I need to check if the user is looking for whether the author is in the wrong for his actions. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his criticism was justified. Since his girlfriend's behavior was problematic, his criticism is valid, but the tone might be an issue. However, in terms of being in the wrong, he's not. So answer B.\n"
