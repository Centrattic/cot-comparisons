We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend's dislike of babies pathetic and not cool or edgy. First, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which he finds unreasonable. He calls her behavior \"ridiculous\" and \"obnoxious,\" especially after an incident where she left a baby on a couch and complained about it. He confronts her about it, and she responds by reinforcing her views. The author thinks she's using an \"edgy\" persona, which he finds cringey.\n\nNow, the key points here are about whether the author's criticism was justified. The girlfriend's dislike of babies isn't illegal, but the author is upset about her public behavior. He's frustrated that she didn't handle the situation better, like declining to hold the baby upfront. The author's issue is more with how she expressed her dislike rather than the dislike itself.\n\nBut is he wrong for telling her that her hate is pathetic? Well, criticizing someone's personal preferences, especially when they affect interactions with others, can be tough. The girlfriend's actions during the party were inconsiderate, so the author's frustration is valid. However, the way he framed his criticism (\"pathetic,\" \"doesn't make her cool\") might come off as dismissive. Arguing someone's personality traits is a delicate matter, especially in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior could be a red flag for the author if he expects her to interact with his family, which includes kids. The author has a right to express his concerns about her actions, but calling her opinions pathetic might be invalidating. It's possible the author is right to address the behavior but in a harsh way, which could lead to conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might be part of the problem. However, the core issue is whether the author was wrong. If the girlfriend's behavior is causing problems in their relationship or interactions with family, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. But the manner in which he did so could be improved. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's nuance.\n"
