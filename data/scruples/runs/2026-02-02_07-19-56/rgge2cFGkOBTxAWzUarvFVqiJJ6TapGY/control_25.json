We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who dislikes babies and kids, and the author told her that her hate is pathetic and not cool. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend has an edgy persona, which includes hating people and comparing the 80s favorably (even though she wasn't alive then). She also has a strong dislike for babies and kids, leading to some awkward situations at a family party. The author is upset because her behavior was rude, like moving away from a baby, getting a couch dirty, and passing a blanket in a gross way.\n\nThe author confronted her, saying her behavior is ridiculous, and the girlfriend called him an asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong for his reaction.\n\nI should consider a few points. First, the girlfriend's behavior: she did act inconsiderately in front of family. Moving away from a baby, being rude when handling a diaper, and spreading negative attitudes. That's not cool, especially in a family setting where kids are present. The author was defending the baby and pointing out the inconsiderate behavior. \n\nBut then, there's the way the author communicated. He called her actions \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool or edgy. That's pretty harsh. Even if her behavior was inconsiderate, calling her pathetic might be condescending. Maybe there's a better way to address it without being dismissive of her feelings, even if they're irrational.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's social anxiety was mentioned. She was afraid of seeming rude, so she ended up in a situation she didn't want. The author might not have considered that she was uncomfortable and didn't handle it well. Instead of just criticizing her, maybe he could have supported her in declining the task politely next time.\n\nOn the other hand, her actions were indeed awkward and inconsiderate. The author's frustration is understandable. But how he expressed it might have been unkind. Telling someone their feelings are pathetic isn't a constructive way to address the behavior. It's possible that the author is right about the behavior being problematic but wrong in his approach.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's behavior was rude, but he could have handled the conversation more respectfully. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he directly called her feelings pathetic and invalidating, that's probably where he went wrong. It's not just about the behavior but how he addressed it. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because his response was harsh and unkind, even if he had valid concerns.\n"
