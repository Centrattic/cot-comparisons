We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 18-year-old guy) is in the wrong for criticizing his girlfriend's dislike of babies. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which she expresses in various ways\u2014moving away when kids approach, making edgy comments, and even reacting poorly when holding a baby. The author finds her behavior rude and inconsiderate, especially when she left a baby on a couch during a diaper change and flicked a blanket. He called her attitude pathetic and not cool, which upset her.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the key points are about respect and communication. The author is frustrated because her actions affect others, like his sister's baby. He's standing up for his views, which is reasonable. However, telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" might be harsh, even if he's upset. But the girlfriend's behavior might also be unreasonable\u2014disliking kids is one thing, but acting rudely in public and not considering others' feelings is another.\n\nThe author's criticism is based on her actions being inconsiderate, which is a valid concern. However, the way he expressed it\u2014calling her hate \"pathetic\"\u2014could come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's response about her views is also problematic, but the author's approach might not be entirely wrong. It's a conflict of perspectives. The main issue is whether the author had the right to confront her that way. Since the question is about who is in the wrong, both sides have valid points. However, the author's main issue is her inconsiderate actions, which he has a right to address. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
