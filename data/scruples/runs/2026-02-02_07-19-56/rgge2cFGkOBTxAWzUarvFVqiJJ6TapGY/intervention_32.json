We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend that her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments. She dislikes kids and babies, which she's expressed in various ways, like avoiding them, making excuses, and being rude around them. The specific incident was at a family party where she ended up holding the baby, then put it down in a messy way, got angry, and did other inconsiderate things. The author confronted her about it, and she responded defensively, saying kids are bad. The author told her it's ridiculous and that her edgy narrative is stupid, leading her to think he's an asshole.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to see if that's the case. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's behavior was rude and inconsiderate. She didn't handle the situation well, especially in a social setting with family. The author had a right to be upset about her actions. However, the way the author addressed the issue might be problematic. Telling someone their views are \"pathetic\" and that it doesn't make them cool or edgy could come off as dismissive and condescending. Instead of addressing her behavior, he's attacking her character and the reasons behind her dislike. Even if her actions were inappropriate, the approach of calling her views pathetic might be invalidating and not constructive. Healthy communication would involve discussing the behavior and its impact, not deriding her for having those views.\n\nAlso, considering that their relationship is new (four months), the author's response could be seen as harsh. While it's important to discuss differing values or behaviors that affect the relationship, the tone and choice of words matter. The author's message that her edgy persona isn't valid might hurt her feelings and lead to defensiveness rather than a productive conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were indeed problematic. She didn't communicate her discomfort, acted disrespectfully in front of family, and her excuses seemed immature. The author has valid concerns about her inability to interact with children, which could be an issue in shared situations. However, the way he addressed it might have been too confrontational and not solution-focused.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to express concerns without attacking the person's identity or beliefs. The author's approach of labeling her views as pathetic and edgy might have been more about dismissing her persona than addressing the actual behavior. So, even though her actions were wrong, the author's method of confrontation might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how he communicated his concerns rather than the content of his message.\n"
