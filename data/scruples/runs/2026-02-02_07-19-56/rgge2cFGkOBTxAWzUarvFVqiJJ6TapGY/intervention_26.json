We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA situation) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an edgy, grunge aesthetic and makes edgelord comments. The author finds her occasional comments cringey but manageable. However, her behavior around babies is more intense\u2014giving dirty looks, groaning, moving away from her sister, and even getting a baby diaper on the couch and being rude about it. The author is upset because her actions are not just dislike but actively disdainful and inconsiderate, especially in a family setting where kids are present. He confronted her, and she responded defensively, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to call her behavior pathetic and not cool. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, it's important to respect others' personal preferences, even if they're different. Disliking babies isn't inherently wrong, but acting on that dislike in a public or family setting with social anxiety might be a factor. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as rude, especially when she was in a situation where she had to interact with a baby, and she didn't handle it gracefully. The author is right to point out that if she couldn't handle it, she should have declined or asked for help, not just left the baby unattended and made a mess. Her excuses and behavior might be unprofessional or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might have been harsh. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" and that they're not cool or edgy could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. Even if her actions were rude, the way he communicated his disapproval might have been unkind. There's a difference between disliking kids and being openly hostile, but the author's response was a direct criticism of her personality traits, which could be seen as attacking her character rather than addressing the specific behavior.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend has social anxiety, which might explain why she didn't say no in the moment. The author might not have considered that her anxiety made it harder for her to decline, leading to the awkward situation. However, that doesn't excuse the actions she took once she was holding the baby. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author's criticism was justified in the way he delivered it. While her actions were problematic, calling her behavior pathetic and not cool could be seen as an overreaction or an attack on her identity, especially since she's in a relationship where mutual respect is important. The author should have addressed the specific behaviors (like moving away from the cousin, handling the blanket poorly) without belittling her personal preferences. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's pointing out valid social inconsideration, but the way he did it could be improved. However, if the question is strictly about whether his actions were wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if his response was reasonable given the context. The girlfriend's behavior was clearly inconsiderate, and the author had a right to express his concern, but the phrasing might have been hurtful. \n\nIn some relationships, calling someone's dislike of babies pathetic could be seen as judgmental. The author could have approached it more compassionately. But the situation involved multiple instances of her being rude, so maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the user is unsure and the answer options are A or B, I need to decide based on typical AITA standards. Usually, if someone's behavior is rude, the person who points it out isn't in the wrong unless they were disrespectful. The author was direct and maybe a bit harsh in his words, but the core issue is her actions. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I have to check if his comment was within bounds. Saying it's \"pathetic\" and that it doesn't make her cool might be unkind, but not necessarily wrong. It's more about how respectful his communication was. The girlfriend's actions were definitely problematic, so the author's concern is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
