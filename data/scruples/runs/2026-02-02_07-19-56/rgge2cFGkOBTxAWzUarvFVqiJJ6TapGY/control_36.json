We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (18m) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend (19) that her hate for babies is pathetic and not cool/edgy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The girlfriend has an edgy, maybe grunge aesthetic, and she makes comments that the author finds cringey, like hating people, talking about the 80s, and disliking kids. She avoids kids, gives them dirty looks, and was rude at a family party by putting a baby down unceremoniously. The author is upset because her behavior is not just dislike but active rudeness and avoidance, expecting others to accommodate her.\n\nThe author confronted her, saying her behavior is ridiculous and that she's acting like an edgelord. The girlfriend is upset and thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's fair for the author to criticize her for this. On one hand, everyone has the right to dislike things, but acting rudely in public and expecting others to avoid kids is problematic. The author might think she should be more considerate, especially since it's a family event where kids are present. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's preferences are personal. However, her actions (like moving away from the kid, flicking the blanket) might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. The author's criticism is about how she's expressing her dislike, not the dislike itself. \n\nBut is the author wrong to call her out on that? If they're in a relationship, communication is key. The author did confront her, maybe in a direct way, but if her behavior is causing issues with his family or making others uncomfortable, he has a point. However, the way he phrased it (\"pathetic\", \"doesn't make her cool or edgy\") might be condescending. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was defensive, which is common. The author might need to approach such topics with more empathy. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since her actions were clearly inconsiderate, his criticism might be justified, but the manner could be an issue. However, the main point is that the author is not in the wrong for pointing out her rude behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
