We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author confronting their girlfriend for her dislike of babies and kids, and she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments, which the author finds a bit cringey but manageable. The main issue is her intense dislike for babies and children. At a family party, she ended up holding a baby during a diaper change and then put the baby down immediately, causing a mess and shouting. She also avoided sitting next to a five-year-old cousin and handled a baby's blanket in a dismissive way. The author criticized her for being rude and not handling the situation better, leading to an argument where the girlfriend says the author is an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is expressing their opinion that their girlfriend's behavior is inappropriate and that she's being rude. The girlfriend's actions are indeed inconsiderate, especially in a family setting where there might be others present, like the new mother. The author's response was to tell her it's ridiculous, which is a judgment. But is that wrong?\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior could be seen as disrespectful. She took the baby without being asked, handled it carelessly, and used derogatory language. The author's reaction is to point out that her actions are not making her cool or edgy. While the author could have approached the situation more gently, the girlfriend's behavior was the initial problem. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting her to be kinder, but did they cross a line in how they communicated it?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend has social anxiety and was afraid of seeming rude. Maybe she didn't know how to say no. The author's frustration is understandable, but confronting her in a public or sensitive context (like after an incident) might not be the best approach. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. The girlfriend's actions were objectively inconsiderate, so the author's criticism isn't baseless. The author's statement that her hate is \"pathetic\" might be harsh, but the underlying point is valid. The answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong, because the girlfriend's behavior was the main issue, and the author is addressing it.\n"
