We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for criticizing his girlfriend's dislike of babies. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has a strong aversion to babies and kids, which she's shown in various ways. The author is upset because she was rude during a family event, putting a baby down abruptly and acting dismissively. He confronts her, calling her behavior pathetic and uncool, and she reacts negatively.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about respect and communication in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions (moving away from kids, flicking a blanket, etc.) are indeed inconsiderate and could be hurtful, especially in a family setting where others might have different attitudes towards children. The author has a right to express his frustration, especially since her behavior affected others (like the sister who's a new mom).\n\nHowever, the way the author communicated his concerns might be problematic. Telling someone their preferences are \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make you cool or edgy\" is judgmental and could come across as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the behavior is inconsiderate, the approach to addressing it could be more compassionate. It's important to address the behavior without attacking her personality or preferences.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend's actions are objectively rude and inconsiderate. The author is justified in feeling upset because she didn't handle the situation gracefully, especially in front of family. However, the tone and choice of words might have been harsh. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling her out. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have differing values or preferences. The issue here is more about how the author addressed it rather than the content of his criticism. If he had expressed his concerns without belittling her, it might have been more constructive. But the problem isn't that he's wrong to be upset; it's that his response was harsh. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not if he could have handled it better. \n\nConsidering that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for pointing that out. But his method of doing so could be improved. However, the question is whether he's the asshole. The answer might lean towards B (No), because the author's criticism, while harsh, is a valid concern. The girlfriend's behavior was rude, and while the delivery could be better, that doesn't make him the asshole. The girlfriend might need to adjust her behavior, so the author isn't entirely wrong to address it.\n"
