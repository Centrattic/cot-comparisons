We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author confronting his girlfriend over her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds rude and obnoxious. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes comments that he finds cringy. The key points are her behavior towards kids, like avoiding them, making excuses, and the incident at the family party where she put down the baby and got it dirty.\n\nThe author told her that her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, respect in relationships is important. If her dislike is a personal choice and she's not harming anyone, maybe the author overstepped by calling her behavior pathetic. On the other hand, if her actions were rude (like the baby incident), then the author might be justified in pointing out the inconsiderate behavior.\n\nHer behavior at the party was inconsiderate. She put the baby down on the couch without asking, leading to a mess, and flicked the blanket. Those actions could be seen as disrespectful in a family setting. The author is within his right to express that he finds her behavior inappropriate, especially in his own home.\n\nHowever, the way he delivered the criticism might be an issue. Telling someone their feelings are \"pathetic\" can come off as dismissive. It's more effective to address specific actions rather than the person's feelings. The girlfriend's dislike of kids is her personal preference, but acting on it in a way that affects others (like the baby) is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for pointing out her inconsiderate actions, but maybe the tone or choice of words could have been better. The main issue is her behavior towards others' children, which the author has a right to address. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
