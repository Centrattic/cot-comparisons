We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who dislikes babies and kids, and her behavior during a family party.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments. She hates kids, avoids them, and acted rudely at the party by putting down a baby and making a mess. The author confronted her, saying her behavior is pathetic and not cool, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author is 18, and his girlfriend is 19. They've been dating four months. The main issue is whether the author was wrong to call her out. \n\nI should consider the girlfriend's actions. Avoiding kids might be a personal preference, but her behavior during the party (like moving away from a child, handling a baby's blanket disrespectfully, and the incident with the baby) could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is pointing out that her actions are not cool or edgy, but rather rude. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's dislike for kids is a valid personal choice, especially if she's not a parent. The author might have overreacted by calling her out in a judgmental way. However, the way she handled the baby situation was clearly inappropriate, and the author had a right to express that. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's criticism was about the behavior rather than her personal preferences, then maybe he's justified. But if he was being dismissive or invalidating her feelings, that could be problematic. However, the story mentions her actions were \"rude and obnoxious,\" so the author's response might be reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author expressed his concerns after the incident, which is important. The girlfriend's reaction was defensive, but the author isn't wrong for pointing out actual inconsiderate behavior. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, could he be wrong? Maybe by calling her hate \"pathetic\" and not cool, he's belittling her feelings. It's possible that her dislike of kids is a personal choice, even if her actions were rude. The author might have focused on the behavior correctly but used judgmental language. However, the context shows that her actions were problematic, so the author's feedback is valid. \n\nI think the balance tips towards the author not being in the wrong because the actions in question were clearly inappropriate, and he's addressing them. So answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
