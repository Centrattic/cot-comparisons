We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend's dislike of babies pathetic and not cool.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which the author finds obnoxious. The author gives examples like her moving away from kids, making derogatory comments, and mishandling a baby at a family event. The girlfriend's behavior was rude, especially when she left the baby on the couch without help. The author confronted her, saying her attitude is ridiculous and that she needs to interact with kids sometimes. The girlfriend responded by sticking to her edgy narrative, and now she's upset with the author.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's criticism is about the girlfriend's behavior being rude and not acceptable in social situations. The girlfriend's dislike of kids isn't illegal, but her actions (like avoiding interaction and treating others poorly) are problematic. The author's response was to point out the issue, which is a valid concern in a relationship where such behavior affects others. However, the author's tone might be harsh, calling her attitude \"pathetic\" and \"pathetic\" could be seen as dismissive. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, especially towards the author's sister and cousin. The author has a right to express that her behavior is unacceptable. However, the way he criticized her might have been harsh. Still, the core issue is her behavior, not the author's right to address it. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. The author isn't wrong for pointing out her behavior, but the manner could be improved. However, the question isn't about the best approach but whether he's in the wrong. Since he's addressing a valid concern, he's not in the wrong.\n"
