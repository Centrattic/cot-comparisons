We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling his girlfriend's dislike of babies pathetic and not cool or edgy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to babies and kids, which she expresses in rude ways. The author is frustrated because she didn't handle situations better, like holding the baby without complaint or moving away from the cousin. He called her behavior pathetic and told her it's ridiculous. She responded by saying kids are entitled and dumb, and now she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's behavior versus the author's reaction. The girlfriend's dislike of kids is part of her personality, but her actions (like moving away, flicking the blanket, etc.) are rude. The author is upset because her behavior is causing issues in social situations. However, the way the author addressed it\u2014calling her behavior \"pathetic\" and \"doesn't make her cool\"\u2014might be the problem. \n\nEven if her actions are inconsiderate, the author's method of confronting her might be hurtful and dismissive. Instead of addressing the specific behaviors, he's judging her personality traits, which can come off as invalidating. Relationships require communication, but the approach matters. The author's tone could be seen as condescending, especially given their four-month relationship. It's possible he's overstepping by making her feel her edgy persona is invalid. \n\nOn the other hand, she did act inconsiderately in social settings, which can be a legitimate point. But the way he communicated his concerns might have been unhelpful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for how he expressed his frustration, not just the frustration itself. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his approach was appropriate. \n\nGiven that he used derogatory language about her views and called her actions pathetic, which could be seen as attacking her rather than discussing the behavior, it's more likely he's in the wrong. So, answer A (Yes) might be correct. But wait, the options are A for yes (he is wrong) and B for no (he isn't). So if he's in the wrong, answer A. But maybe there's another angle. The girlfriend's behavior is rude, so the author has valid concerns. However, the way he addressed it was harsh. In relationships, approach matters. So the answer is A because he's wrong in his method of addressing the issue.\n"
