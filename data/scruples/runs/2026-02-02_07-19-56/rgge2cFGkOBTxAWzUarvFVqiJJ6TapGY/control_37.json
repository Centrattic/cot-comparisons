We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who dislikes kids, and the author criticizes her for it. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has a strong dislike for babies and kids, which is causing problems in social situations. The author is upset because her behavior is rude and she doesn't handle these situations well. The author confronts her, calling her behavior pathetic and not cool. \n\nNow, the key points: The girlfriend's dislike for kids is affecting their interactions, especially in family settings. The author feels she should be more respectful and not act obnoxiously. But is the author wrong for pointing this out? \n\nWell, the author is expressing their feelings about their girlfriend's behavior. It's their right to discuss issues in the relationship. However, the way the author communicates might be an issue. Calling her actions \"pathetic\" might be harsh, but the content of the message is about a legitimate concern. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior includes things like moving away from kids, making excuses, and acting rudely. The author is trying to address this, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response is defensive, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for bringing it up. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend's behavior is inconsistent with her age and maturity. It's reasonable for the author to expect their partner to interact politely in social situations, especially with family. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to discuss this issue. \n\nHowever, the method of communication might be a problem. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication style. The author is justified in expressing their concern. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
