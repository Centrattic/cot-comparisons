We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for four months. They met on Instagram, and she has a grunge/edgy aesthetic. She makes edgy comments, which he finds cringey but manageable. The main issue is her dislike for kids and babies, which he finds extreme and rude. \n\nAt a family party, she ended up holding a baby during a diaper change, then put it down abruptly and called it a \"gremlin.\" He's upset because she didn't handle the situation politely. She also avoided his cousin and handled a blanket in a negative way. When he confronted her, he told her her behavior was ridiculous, and she called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer.\n\nLet me consider both sides. The author is criticizing his girlfriend for her dislike of kids and her public behavior. He wants her to be more polite, which is reasonable. But his approach was to tell her her hate is \"pathetic\" and that it doesn't make her cool. That's pretty harsh and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nHer behavior: she doesn't like kids, which is a personal preference. While her actions (like moving away from a child, flicking a blanket) might be rude, people can have strong dislikes. However, the author is in a position where he's trying to address this in a relationship. Criticizing her for being \"uncool\" could come off as invalidating her feelings and her identity, especially since she's into a certain aesthetic where being edgy is part of her self-expression. \n\nThe author's actions might have been a bit confrontational. Instead of addressing the specific incidents (like not holding the baby properly or being rude), he attacked her overall attitude, calling her stance pathetic. That could be seen as inconsiderate, as it's not just about the behavior but her right to have those feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was indeed public and possibly hurtful to the host (his sister). The author has a right to be upset about her rudeness. But the way he addressed it was more about judging her personality rather than discussing the specific actions. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his criticism was justified. If he was pointing out her behavior as rude and discussing it respectfully, maybe not. But his approach was more about telling her she's not cool, which is more about her identity and could be seen as dismissive. In relationships, how you address issues matters. Being confrontational and using words like \"pathetic\" can be seen as the wrong approach, even if the underlying issue has merit. \n\nTherefore, the author's method of confronting her might be where he's in the wrong. He should have addressed specific behaviors without belittling her personality or preferences. So the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of his harsh and dismissive response.\n"
