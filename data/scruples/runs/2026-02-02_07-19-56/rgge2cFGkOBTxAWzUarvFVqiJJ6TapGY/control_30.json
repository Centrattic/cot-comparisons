We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation (AITA post) is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author confronting their girlfriend over her dislike of babies and kids, which they find rude and inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's girlfriend has a strong aversion to children, which is expressed through rude behavior like avoiding sitting near them, being unhelpful during a family party, and acting disdainfully. The author is upset because they think she's being inconsiderate and not respecting others' feelings during family gatherings. \n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that her personal preferences are being criticized, especially since she's not forcing anyone to like kids. However, her actions during the party (like leaving a baby on a couch mid-diaper change and flicking the blanket) could be seen as inconsiderate and hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and boundaries. While people can have preferences, acting out those preferences in a way that's disrespectful or causes discomfort to others (especially in social settings) can be problematic. The author is pointing out that their girlfriend's behavior crosses into rudeness, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe author's response was to confront her about this, which is understandable given the situation. However, the way the confrontation went might have been harsh. The author called her comments \"pathetic\" and \"edgy,\" which might have come off as dismissive of her feelings. That could be where the author is in the wrong\u2014maybe they should have approached it more calmly or discussed it without being judgmental. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were objectively rude. The author has a right to express discomfort with her behavior, especially if it affects their family interactions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions were unreasonable. The girlfriend's behavior seems unreasonable in a social context where accommodating family members (like holding a baby) is expected. The author's criticism is about her actions, not her feelings. However, the way he phrased it (\"pathetic,\" \"doesn't make you cool\") might be where he's in the wrong, as it's more about mocking her attitude rather than discussing the behavior. \n\nSo, the author may be partly right to express concern but wrong in the manner of confronting her. But the main issue is whether the girlfriend's behavior is unacceptable. Since the behavior was indeed rude, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the way he addressed it might have been harsh. However, in AITA, the key is who is more in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are clearly problematic, so the author's criticism, while maybe harshly worded, is justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
