We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that her hatred for babies is pathetic and not making her cool or edgy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, his girlfriend is 19. They've been dating four months, met on Instagram, and she has a grunge/edgy aesthetic. She makes edgelord comments about hating people and life being better in the 80s. The main issue is her intense dislike for babies and kids. The author mentions specific incidents at a family party where she acted rudely around a baby and a cousin. The author confronted her, telling her the behavior was ridiculous and that her edgy narrative is stupid. Now the girlfriend thinks he's an asshole.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong? A for yes, B for no.\n\nLet me break it down. The author is expressing his disapproval of his girlfriend's behavior. He finds her hate for babies to be not cool. But is that wrong? The girlfriend's actions (like moving away from kids, being rude, getting upset when holding a baby) could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is pointing out that her behavior is not actually edgy but just rude. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as dismissive or condescending. He says her reasons are like \"when you're 13 and in your emo phase,\" which could be seen as belittling her feelings. Also, the girlfriend might feel that her boundaries are being criticized. Maybe she's uncomfortable around kids due to social anxiety or personal preferences, and the author is calling her out for it in a way that's invalidating.\n\nBut on the other hand, she did act rudely in social settings. The author is trying to address behavior that affects their social interactions and possibly their relationship. He's not just criticizing her for being edgy, but for acting in a way that's inconsiderate to others (like getting the couch dirty, flicking the blanket). \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to express his disapproval. In a relationship, partners are expected to communicate their concerns. However, the way he did it might be the problem. Telling her her hate is \"pathetic\" and that it doesn't make her cool could be seen as shaming, which is not constructive. Maybe he should have discussed the specific behaviors rather than her persona. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In the context of the situation, if the girlfriend's actions are inconsiderate and the author is trying to bring that to her attention, he's not entirely wrong. However, his delivery might be harsh. But the question isn't about the best approach, just whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions are objectively rude, so the author isn't wrong for pointing that out. However, the way he does it could be problematic. But the answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B (no, he's not in the wrong). The author is addressing his girlfriend's inconsiderate behavior, which is a valid concern. However, the phrasing of the question might depend on cultural or personal values. But given the context, the author's intention to address the behavior isn't wrong. The problem might be in how he communicated it, but the core issue of criticizing her actions isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
