We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the guy in the story) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hate for babies is pathetic and not cool/edgy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend (19F) has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments, including hating kids. The author finds her behavior toward babies and kids unacceptable, especially after an incident at a family party where she was rude with his sister's baby. He confronts her, and she responds by justifying her views. The author then tells her her attitude is ridiculous and not cool, which made her think he's an asshole.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries, respect, and communication in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions (like moving away from kids, being rude with the baby) are problematic. The author is upset because her behavior is inconsiderate and harmful, especially in family settings. He expresses his disapproval, which is a valid reaction if her actions are hurting others or causing issues.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The problem might be how he addressed it. He called her behavior \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool or edgy. That's pretty harsh and could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if her actions are inconsiderate, the way he communicated his concerns might have been unkind. In a relationship, constructive criticism is better than putting someone down. The girlfriend's dislike for kids is part of her personality, and while it's not acceptable to be rude, telling her it's pathetic could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel that her behavior is unacceptable, especially when it affects others (like getting baby stuff on the couch). The core issue is whether the author's approach was wrong. If he had calmly expressed his concerns about her actions being rude and inconsiderate, that might be more constructive. But the way he framed it (\"pathetic\" and invalidating her edgy image) might have been the problem.\n\nSo, the author's criticism is valid in the sense that her behavior is rude, but the way he delivered it could be seen as harsh and disrespectful. Therefore, he might share some responsibility for the conflict. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their communication style. If they usually communicate respectfully, maybe not. But the way he chose to attack her personality (calling her views pathetic and uncool) could be wrong.\n"
