We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend's dislike of babies and kids, which the author called out as pathetic and not cool.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend has an aversion to babies, which seems to be part of her edgy persona. She's 19, so maybe that's just her way of expressing herself. The author points out specific incidents where her behavior was rude, like putting down a baby during a diaper change and avoiding a cousin. The author felt she should have been more considerate and not acted out in front of family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell her that her hate for babies is pathetic. The key here is whether the author's response was inconsiderate. The author is frustrated because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate towards others, especially in a family setting. But was calling her out as \"pathetic\" the right approach?\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters. Telling someone their feelings are pathetic might be dismissive. It's possible that the author should have discussed the behavior without belittling her views. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so there's a valid point in addressing that. The balance is between respecting each other's feelings and addressing problematic behavior.\n\nThe girlfriend's dislike for babies isn't illegal, but acting on it in a way that affects others (like refusing to help or being rude) is where the issue lies. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it could have been more constructive. Insulting her stance might have been the wrong approach.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for the way he criticized her views, even if her actions were inconsiderate. However, if the behavior was consistently rude, then the author has a point. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the question is about the author's actions specifically (calling her hate pathetic), the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because that's a judgment on her feelings rather than addressing the behavior constructively.\n"
