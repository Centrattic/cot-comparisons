We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's dislike for babies and kids, and the author confronting her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for four months, which isn't that long. The girlfriend has an edgy persona, which includes making comments about hating people and life in the 80s. Her dislike for babies is portrayed as extreme\u2014avoiding them, giving dirty looks, and being rude when forced into a situation with a baby. The author took her to his parents' family party where she ended up holding a baby, then acted obnoxiously, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author told her her behavior was ridiculous, and she called him an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate.\n\nSo, what's right here? The girlfriend's actions seem problematic. She didn't want to hold the baby but didn't refuse when asked, leading to her being in an uncomfortable situation. Then, she reacted poorly, causing a mess and being rude. The author is upset about her rudeness and the way she handled the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to call her out, saying her hate is pathetic and not cool. That could be seen as dismissive. However, the girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate. The author has a right to express his feelings, especially since her actions affected others (like getting the couch dirty).\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he directly criticized her in a harsh way, maybe. However, the girlfriend's actions were unkind. The key is whether the author's response was justified. The author might have handled it better, but the girlfriend's behavior was the root issue. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were rude. But maybe he could have approached it more gently. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer likely is B, meaning the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's behavior was the main problem, and he had a right to express his concerns.\n"
