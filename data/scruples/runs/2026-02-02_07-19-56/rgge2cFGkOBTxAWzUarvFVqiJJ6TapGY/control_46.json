We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the guy in the story) is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girl has a strong dislike for babies and kids, to the point of being rude. The guy calls her behavior pathetic and not edgy, leading to conflict. The key points here are about whether his response was justified.\n\nSo, the girl's behavior is problematic. She doesn't like kids, which is her choice, but she acts in a way that's inconsiderate\u2014like moving away from a child, flicking a blanket, and handling a baby improperly. The guy is upset because she's being rude and expecting others to accommodate her aversion without her effort.\n\nThe question is if the guy is in the wrong for calling her out. Well, he's expressing his frustration about her inconsiderate actions. But how he did it matters. He called her hate \"pathetic\" and said it doesn't make her cool or edgy. That's pretty direct and could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, her actions were objectively inconsiderate towards others, especially in a family setting where kids are present.\n\nBut should he have addressed it in a different way? Maybe, but the core issue is whether his criticism was unwarranted. The girl's behavior was inappropriate, so pointing that out isn't wrong. However, the way he did it might have been harsh. But the question isn't about the best way to communicate\u2014it's about whether he was wrong to point it out at all.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues, but the manner can affect the outcome. However, the guy isn't wrong for pointing out that her behavior is unacceptable. The girl's actions were rude, so the guy isn't in the wrong for calling her out. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
