We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author confronting their girlfriend for her dislike of babies and kids, which they find rude and inconsiderate. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids, which she expresses in various ways\u2014moving away, making comments, and even acting rudely during a family event where she had to hold a baby. The author is upset because her behavior is not just a dislike but an obnoxious display, and they confront her about it. She responds by doubling down on her edgy persona.\n\nNow, considering the ethics of the situation. The author's girlfriend has the right to her opinions, but when those opinions lead to inconsiderate or rude behavior towards others (like not wanting to hold the baby and making a mess), it becomes a matter of social conduct. The author is pointing out that her actions are not just personal dislike but are causing discomfort and inconvenience to others, especially family members. \n\nIs the author being too harsh? Well, the girlfriend's actions go beyond personal dislike\u2014they involve social anxiety but also a lack of consideration. The author is trying to address the behavior that's affecting their family interactions. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and uncooperative, which might indicate that she's not open to feedback.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached the conversation differently, maybe with more empathy. But does that mean the author is in the wrong? The question is whether the author's actions (telling her that her hate is pathetic) are wrong. The author's criticism is about her behavior being inconsiderate, which is valid. But the way they phrased it might come off as dismissive of her feelings or her identity. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsiderate behavior, but there's room for a more constructive approach. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, and the author has a right to express their concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
