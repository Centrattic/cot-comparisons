We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and not cool. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a grunge/edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments, including hating kids. The author finds her behavior towards babies and children to be rude, like moving away from a cousin, flicking a blanket, and dropping a baby during a diaper change. The author called her out for being pathetic, and she thinks he's an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the context. The girlfriend's actions are definitely inconsiderate. She was in a family event where kids are present, and her behavior might have been disruptive. The author is frustrated because she expects others to accommodate her dislike without any effort from her side. However, the author's response was to tell her she's \"pathetic\" and that her views don't make her cool or edgy. That's pretty harsh. Even if her actions were rude, calling someone pathetic might not be constructive. It's possible that the author should have addressed the behavior without attacking her personality or edgy persona. Maybe he could have discussed how her actions made him feel instead of labeling her views as pathetic. But then again, her behavior was inconsiderate and rude. So it's a balance between valid criticism and harsh judgment. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's criticism was about specific behaviors and not personal attacks, maybe he's not wrong. But using words like \"pathetic\" and implying her edgy persona is invalid might be crossing a line. The girlfriend's response of calling him an asshole suggests that she felt attacked personally. So maybe the author's approach was too harsh, making him at least partially in the wrong. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong for making that comment. Considering that the author is pointing out her inconsiderate behavior, but the way he did it was condescending, it's a bit of both. But according to the options given, the answer is either A (yes) or B (no). I think the key here is that the author's criticism was valid in pointing out her rude behavior, but his method was harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the criticism is valid but the delivery is harsh, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his words were unnecessarily hurtful, then he might be. It's a bit of a toss-up. The user is using \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) framework. In those cases, if the person's actions, while maybe poorly delivered, aim to correct someone else's problematic behavior, they might not be the asshole. But if the criticism is personal and not addressing the behavior, then they could be. The author did address her behavior (calling her hate pathetic), but maybe in a condescending way. The edgy comments she makes are part of her persona, so telling her that it's pathetic might be attacking her identity. So maybe the author is in the wrong by focusing on her edgy narrative instead of discussing the specific incidents. Alternatively, he's justified in pointing out that her behavior is inconsiderate. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because his response was dismissive of her feelings and possibly invalidating her. However, his girlfriend's actions were rude. Hmm. Given that the user is asking for an answer, and the options are A or B. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because he was addressing her behavior, even if the tone was harsh. In AITA scenarios, if someone is trying to correct a partner's inconsiderate actions, even if the way they do it is rough, they're often not considered the asshole. However, if the criticism is personal and not constructive, maybe A. But the key here is that the author's main point was about her behavior, not her personality. So maybe B.\n"
