We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting his girlfriend about her dislike of babies and calling her behavior pathetic and not cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: They've been dating four months. He's 18, she's 19. She has an edgy aesthetic and makes edgelord comments. She's really against kids, even has a four-year-old sister she avoids. Then there's the incident at the family party where she ended up holding a baby, got upset, put the baby down in a messy way, and acted obnoxiously. The author is frustrated because he thinks she shouldn't be so rude and expects kids to avoid her. He confronts her, and she's upset, thinking he's an asshole.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points are whether his response was justified. He's pointing out her behavior as rude and unrealistic. Kids are part of life, especially in family settings. Her actions were inconsiderate\u2014leaving the baby on the couch, avoiding the cousin, flicking the blanket. The author is expressing concern about her social behavior, which could be valid. However, the way he framed it as \"pathetic\" and not cool might be harsh, especially since she has social anxiety. Her excuses, like the sister being dirty, are silly, but he's the one calling her out on her own terms. The edgy persona might contribute to her behavior, but he's pushing back against that. \n\nBut was he wrong? If he's addressing her behavior in a family setting where consideration for others (like the new mom) is important, then pointing out the rudeness is reasonable. However, the tone of his response\u2014calling her behavior pathetic\u2014could come off as dismissive. But considering their four-month relationship, maybe he's justified in wanting her to be more considerate. The girlfriend's reaction is also a factor; she's defensive and doesn't take his feedback well. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the right because he's encouraging her to act more socially appropriate, especially since her actions affected others (like the mom handling a mess). But maybe he overstepped by mocking her edgy persona. However, given the context of the incidents, his criticism isn't baseless. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong) because he's pointing out valid social issues in her behavior, even if his tone was harsh. The core issue is her inconsiderate actions, not just her dislike of kids. The author is helping her see how her actions impact others, which is a healthy relationship dynamic. But if he was bullying her for her personal preferences, it would be different. Here, the problem is her behavior towards others, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
