We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend that her dislike for babies is pathetic and not making her cool or edgy.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a strong aversion to kids and babies, which includes rude behavior like moving away from them, making negative comments, and mishandling a baby during a family event. The author is upset about her behavior, especially since it caused problems at a family gathering. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The girlfriend's actions might be her personal preference, but acting rudely towards others (like babies and their families) can be seen as inconsiderate. The author confronted her about this, pointing out that her behavior is not acceptable. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to criticize her. In relationships, it's important to address issues that affect the other person or others around you. The author's criticism is about her behavior, not her preferences. While it's okay to dislike kids, acting obnoxiously in public or causing discomfort can be a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been harsh\u2014calling her behavior \"pathetic\" and invalidating her edgy persona. That could come off as dismissive. But the underlying issue is her inconsiderate actions. So, the author had a reason to address it, even if the delivery could be improved. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out her behavior, even if the way he did it could be better. The main issue is her actions, not the dislike itself. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
