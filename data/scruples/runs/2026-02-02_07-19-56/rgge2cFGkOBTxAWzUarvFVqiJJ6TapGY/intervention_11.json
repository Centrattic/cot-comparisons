We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting his girlfriend about her dislike of babies and kids, which he finds childish and rude. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has a strong aversion to children, which she's shown through her actions\u2014moving away from them, making negative comments, and rudely handling a baby at a family party. The author feels that her behavior is unacceptable and confronts her, calling her actions pathetic and not cool. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author is expressing frustration because his girlfriend's actions are causing issues in their interactions with family and others. He might be right to feel that her behavior is inconsiderate. However, on the other hand, the girlfriend has the right to her personal preferences, even if they're not socially accepted. The author might have overstepped by criticizing her in a way that's dismissive of her feelings or reasons for disliking kids.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was appropriate. He called her behavior pathetic and not cool, which could be seen as belittling. The girlfriend has her own aesthetic and identity, and the author's criticism might have hurt her in a way that's more personal than just the situation. It's possible that the author didn't approach the conversation with enough empathy, focusing more on the social inappropriateness rather than understanding her perspective.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's actions at the party\u2014like putting the baby down in a messy situation\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. But her social anxiety might be a factor in why she didn't say no. The author might not have considered that. However, the way he confronted her might have been harsh, leading her to feel attacked.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's not uncommon for people to dislike kids, even if it's frowned upon. The author's judgment about her being \"edgy\" and \"pathetic\" could be based on his own values rather than understanding her stance. It's a balance between expressing valid concerns and respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for the way he confronted her, even if her actions were rude. The key point is whether his criticism was constructive and respectful. If he used derogatory language or dismissed her feelings, that's where he's wrong. On the other hand, if he just expressed his concerns factually, then maybe not. The way he phrased it (\"pathetic\", \"doesn't make her cool\") suggests a judgmental tone, which likely contributed to the conflict.\n"
