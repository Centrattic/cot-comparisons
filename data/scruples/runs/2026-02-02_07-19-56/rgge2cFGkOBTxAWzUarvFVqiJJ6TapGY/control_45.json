We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend that her hatred of babies is pathetic and not cool or edgy. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a strong dislike for babies and kids, which she expresses through actions like avoiding them and making comments. The author finds this behavior cringey and rude, especially when she handled the baby poorly at a family party. He confronts her about it, saying her attitude is ridiculous and she's being an edgelord.\n\nNow, the key points are whether the author overstepped. The girlfriend's actions seem disrespectful and inconsiderate in a family setting. The author is addressing her behavior, which could be seen as valid because he's pointing out how her actions affect others. However, the way he called her hate \"pathetic\" and invalidated her aesthetic might be harsh. \n\nBut context matters. They've only been dating four months, and the author was initially drawn to her edgy persona. Now he's criticizing that same part of her. Is it fair to call her feelings pathetic? Maybe not. However, her behavior at the party was inconsiderate, so the author has a point about how she handled it. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response was wrong. He expressed his frustration about her inconsiderate actions. While his criticism might be a bit harsh, he's not in the wrong for wanting to address behavior that's causing issues in their relationship. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, so the author isn't wrong for pointing that out. So, answer B.\n"
