We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl who dislikes babies and kids, and the author called her out for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's girlfriend has an edgy personality, which includes hating babies and kids. The author found her behavior during a family party unacceptable, especially when she mishandled the baby and was rude. He confronted her, saying her hate is pathetic and not cool. She thinks he's an asshole for that.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell her she's being pathetic. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's behavior: moving away from kids, making excuses, acting obnoxiously. The author is frustrated because she expects kids to avoid her without her making an effort. He's defending the kids and telling her to be more respectful.\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to express his feelings about her behavior, especially if it's affecting their relationship. If her actions were rude, he might be justified in calling her out. However, his approach was to label her feelings as \"pathetic\" and dismiss her edgy persona. That could be condescending and hurtful. Instead of addressing her discomfort, he invalidated her emotions, which might not be the best approach in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's dislike for kids is part of her personality, even if it's not nice. The author's reaction was a direct criticism of her feelings, which can be seen as attacking her character rather than discussing the specific incidents. However, he's also pointing out that her behavior is inconsiderate in social situations. \n\nBut the key issue is whether he was wrong to call her hate \"pathetic.\" If the girlfriend's dislike is genuine, even if it's not acceptable, the author's response was harsh. He should have handled it with more empathy, understanding that her feelings might stem from anxiety or personal experiences. Telling her she's being pathetic is a judgment that could be disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, she did act obnoxiously during the party, and the author had a right to express that he was upset with her actions. However, the way he did it might have been inappropriate. It's about communication style. Instead of calling her feelings pathetic, he could have discussed the impact of her actions without attacking her personality.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he dismissed her feelings and used a derogatory term. While her behavior was rude, his response was not constructive. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his approach was disrespectful rather than addressing the issue constructively.\n"
