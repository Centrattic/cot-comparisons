We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their girlfriend's dislike of babies pathetic and not cool. The situation involves the girlfriend having an edgy aesthetic and making cringey comments, which the author finds annoying. The main issue is her behavior towards babies, like avoiding them and acting rudely at a family party.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's behavior includes giving dirty looks, moving away from kids, making excuses, and even putting a baby down in a messy state. The author feels she's wrong to act that way and confronted her, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her that her hatred is pathetic and doesn't make her cool. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFrom one angle, the author has a right to express their feelings about their partner's behavior, especially if it's causing conflict in their relationship. They might feel that the girlfriend's actions are inconsiderate and need addressing. However, the way the author communicated their disapproval\u2014calling her hate \"pathetic\" and dismissive of her cool image\u2014might be condescending or disrespectful. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior does seem immature, but the author's response could have been more constructive. Instead of attacking her personality or aesthetic, they could have discussed their feelings without judgment. The author's use of words like \"pathetic\" and \"cringey\" might come off as belittling, which isn't a healthy way to address issues in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were indeed problematic. She didn't handle the baby responsibly, which could have been hurtful to the family. The author had a valid concern about her inconsiderate behavior. However, the way the author addressed it might have escalated the conflict instead of resolving it. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, but their approach was harsh and dismissive. They might be at fault for not using a more respectful and understanding tone. The answer likely depends on whether the criticism was delivered in a constructive manner. Since the author used derogatory language and attacked her personality, that's where the fault lies. Therefore, the correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
