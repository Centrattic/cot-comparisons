We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who dislikes babies and kids, and the author confronted her about it after an incident at a family party. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's perspective is that his girlfriend's behavior towards kids is rude and obnoxious. He points out specific examples like her moving away from his cousin, flicking the baby's blanket, and handling the baby poorly at the party. He felt she should have been more polite and willing to engage, even if she doesn't like kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a history of being edgy and making comments about hating people and preferring the 80s. She might see her dislike for kids as part of her personality, and maybe she's been that way for a while. The author met her online where her edgy persona was part of her image, so her behavior might be consistent with how she presented herself. However, when in real-life situations, especially with his family, her actions might clash with his expectations.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author was wrong to confront her. The author's criticism was that her hate for babies is \"pathetic\" and doesn't make her cool or edgy. He called her behavior ridiculous. The girlfriend responded by defending her views, which makes sense if she feels strongly about them. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and preferences unless they are harmful. Disliking kids isn't inherently wrong, but how one expresses that dislike can be. The girlfriend's actions (like moving away, flicking the blanket) might be seen as rude, but the author's approach in telling her it's \"pathetic\" could come off as dismissive or condescending. \n\nThe author might have a valid concern about her social interactions affecting family events, but the way he addressed it might have been harsh. Instead of calling her views pathetic, he could have discussed his feelings about her behavior in a more constructive way. However, he's also within his rights to express that he finds her actions uncool, especially if they cause problems in their relationship. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong for having an opinion or expressing his discomfort with her actions. But the way he phrased it (\"pathetic\") could be seen as harsh. However, given that her behavior did cause issues at the party, his criticism isn't entirely without merit. The girlfriend's defensiveness is also valid if she feels her personality is being attacked. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out her behavior, but his approach could have been more tactful. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (No) because he's addressing valid concerns, even if his method could be improved. The girlfriend's actions were problematic, and the author is justified in discussing them.\n"
