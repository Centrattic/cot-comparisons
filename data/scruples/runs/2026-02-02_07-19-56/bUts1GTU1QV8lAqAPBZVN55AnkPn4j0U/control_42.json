Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo the story is about a person whose birthday is tomorrow. They've been planning a party with their friends to play Smash Ultimate. They really wanted this party because last year their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which ruined their birthday. Now, their dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old) to stay the night, and they found out only today. The person is upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to be informed earlier. They also mentioned that when they asked if their friends could stay, their mom said no.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about communication and autonomy. The author wanted to have a party with their friends, which was important to them after last year's disappointment. The dad made a decision without consulting the child, which caused the surprise. The author isn't against the kid staying but is upset about the lack of communication and the sudden decision. \n\nI need to consider whether the author is being unreasonable. The age of the person isn't specified, but since they're inviting friends and playing video games, maybe they're a teenager. Parents often make decisions for younger kids, but if this person is old enough to plan their own party, maybe they should have more input. \n\nThe dad might have thought it's okay to invite the friend's son because he's a friend, but the child feels their autonomy is being ignored. The fact that the mom said no when the author asked if their friends could stay might add to the frustration, as there's inconsistency in how their parents handle their requests.\n\nIs the author being a jerk for being upset? They have a valid reason\u2014they wanted to plan their event without last-minute changes. The dad didn't consider the child's perspective in planning. The author's reaction is about respecting their wishes and communication, not the actual presence of the other kid. So the issue is more about the process than the content.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents might be at fault for not involving their child in the decision, especially after the previous incident. The author isn't wrong for expressing their feelings about this. They're advocating for their space and preferences. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate grievance about the lack of communication and being given a choice.\n"
