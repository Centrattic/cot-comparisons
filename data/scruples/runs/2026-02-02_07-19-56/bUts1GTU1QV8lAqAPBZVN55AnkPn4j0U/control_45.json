I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the author's dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover without consulting them in time. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and feel excluded from the decision-making process.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author wanted to have a birthday party with friends, and the dad's friend's kid is coming, which wasn't communicated early. The author mentions not being against the sleepover per se but is annoyed because they weren't given a choice and it's a last-minute decision. The parent didn't check with the child even though the kid decided to stay, which adds to the frustration.\n\nConsidering the child's perspective, they might feel that their preferences are not being respected. Parents often make decisions for their children, especially regarding guests and events, but the timing here is an issue. The author had planned the party and was looking forward to it, and the surprise could disrupt their plans or make them feel their autonomy is disregarded. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be trying to accommodate their friend's son and perhaps didn't realize the child's dislike for surprises. However, the author's main concern isn't the presence of the guest but the lack of prior communication and choice. The fact that the author asked to include their own friends for the sleepover and was denied by the mom shows that the rules aren't consistently applied, which might be unfair to the author.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents have the authority to make decisions for their child, but the author's feelings of being upset due to lack of communication and choice are valid. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the author is expressing a dislike for surprises and the situation was handled without their input, it's more about the process rather than the outcome. The parents should have discussed the sleepover earlier and considered the child's preferences, especially when the child had their own plans. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about not being consulted and the last-minute nature of the surprise. The parents' actions may be well-intentioned, but the way the decision was made without the child's input is the issue here.\n"
