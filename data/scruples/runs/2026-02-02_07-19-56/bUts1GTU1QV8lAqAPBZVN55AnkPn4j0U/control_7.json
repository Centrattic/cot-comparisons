I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, which they wanted to be a party with friends. The key points here are that the author had planned the party, wanted to avoid surprises, and felt excluded because their friends can't stay over while the other kid can.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is being unreasonable. The author mentions they don't like surprises and want to be informed in a timely manner. Their parents made the decision without consulting them, which is a problem because the birthday is important. The fact that they were planning a party and the surprise undermines their plans could be a valid reason for their upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be trying to include the friend's son, but they should have considered the author's feelings and plans. The author's request for their friends to stay was denied, which adds to the frustration. The main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the author's wishes. \n\nSince the parents didn't communicate properly and the author's feelings about their own birthday being disrupted are valid, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
