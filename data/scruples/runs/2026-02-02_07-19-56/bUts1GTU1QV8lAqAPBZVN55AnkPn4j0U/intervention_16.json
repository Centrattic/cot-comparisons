I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house for their birthday party.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because they were planning to have friends over for a Smash Ultimate party, and they found out last minute that this other kid is staying. The key points here are the author's desire for a planned party and the surprise about the sleepover. They mention they don't like surprises and want to be told in a timely manner. The parents only told them today about the arrangement made yesterday. \n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying but is upset about the lack of prior notice and the inconsistency in rules (they asked if their friends could stay, and the mom said no). So the main issue is control over their own space and the last-minute decision. \n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might have thought it's okay to let the friend's son stay, maybe considering it a nice gesture. But the author is the one whose space is being used for their birthday, which is a special occasion. The fact that the parents didn't check with the author first and made the decision without considering their feelings could be problematic. \n\nThe author's frustration is about autonomy and control over their own event. It's their birthday, so they have a right to plan it as they wish. The parents might be overstepping by not respecting the author's plan, especially when they were the ones who made the arrangement without consulting the kid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mention trying to resolve the situation themselves. They could have talked to their parents to express their feelings and maybe find a compromise. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the parents made the decision without considering the kid's preference, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents might be at fault here for not communicating better. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they have a valid reason to be upset about the lack of communication and the disruption to their planned birthday.\n"
