I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on the author's birthday, which is causing some upset because they didn't have prior notice and feel it's a surprise they didn't want.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the post. The author is upset because their dad allowed a 10-year-old friend to stay over without informing them, especially on their birthday when they were planning a party. They mention they hate surprises and wanted to be informed in a timely manner. The parents agreed to the sleepover yesterday and told the author today. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but is upset about the lack of notice and the fact that they can't have their own friends stay over, as the mom said no.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is a child planning their birthday party. Parents have control over such decisions, and they might have their own reasons for allowing the sleepover. However, the key issue is the lack of communication and the author feeling excluded from the decision-making process. The author is upset because they wanted to be informed earlier and have control over their own event.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' perspective. They might have thought that since it's their friend's son, it's a favor or a social opportunity. But they didn't consider the child's feelings about hosting a party. The fact that the author had to plan around this without knowing could cause stress or disappointment. Also, the parent said no when the author asked to have their friends stay, adding to the frustration.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their reaction is justified. The author is expressing their feelings about not wanting surprises and wanting to control their own event. Since they're a minor, the parents have the authority to make these decisions, but the author's feelings are valid. The parents might be at fault for not considering the child's feelings and not communicating properly. However, the author's anger might be seen as a normal reaction to not being included in the decision, but they don't have the final say.\n\nBut in AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the person's reaction is reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing valid concerns about their birthday plans being affected. The parents may be the ones at fault for not discussing it earlier. The question is if the author is being unreasonable. Since they're upset about the lack of notice and the inconsistency (their friends can't stay but another child can), their reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
