I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party that the author is hosting, but their dad's friend's son is coming over for a sleepover without the author's prior knowledge.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about consent and communication. The author wanted to have a party with friends and was upset because the sleepover was arranged without their input. The parent mentioned that they told the author that the dad invited the kid, but the decision for the kid to stay overnight was made just a day before. The author doesn't like surprises, especially when it affects their plans. They also note that when they asked if their friends could stay, the mom said no, which adds to their frustration.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel their autonomy is being undermined. They wanted to plan their party, and the last-minute addition of a guest they didn't invite makes them feel like they have no control. The fact that their own friends can't stay over when they asked shows inconsistency, which might make the situation worse.\n\nOn the other side, the parents might be trying to do something nice by including a friend's child, perhaps thinking it's a good opportunity for the author to make new friends. However, the way it was handled\u2014without consulting the author first and doing it last minute\u2014could be seen as dismissive of the author's wishes. Parents often have good intentions, but communication is key, especially when it comes to respecting a teenager's plans.\n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of notice and not being consulted. That's a valid point because even if the guest is okay, the process of including them without input is problematic. The author's frustration seems reasonable given that they were planning a party, and having a surprise guest added without their consent disrupts that. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to be informed about plans that affect their event and to have their preferences considered. The parents might have made a mistake in not discussing it with the author beforehand. So the answer should be B.\n"
