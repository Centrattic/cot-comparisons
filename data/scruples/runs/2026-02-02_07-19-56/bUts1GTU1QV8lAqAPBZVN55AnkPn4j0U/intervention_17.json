I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to have a party with friends and planned to invite them. The issue is that the dad and his friend's kid decided on the sleepover just a day before, which the author found out too late. The author is okay with the kid staying if they had been told earlier but isn't against surprises. However, the timing is an issue here.\n\nThe author mentions not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. The parents agreed on the sleepover the day before and told the author the same day. The author is upset because it's a last-minute decision and they don't have a choice. They also tried to include their friends in the sleepover but were denied.\n\nNow, considering the parents' role, they have the authority to make such decisions. The author's frustration is valid in terms of not being given a say, especially since it's their birthday. However, the parents aren't obligated to consult the child on every detail. The author's main grievance is the lack of prior communication and not the presence of the kid itself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're upset about a decision they can't control. But their feelings are understandable. They wanted to plan their party and felt their preferences were overlooked. The parents might have intended to include the kid but didn't consider the timing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are acting in their role as caregivers, making decisions for the household. The author's reaction is about personal preference and autonomy, which is reasonable. However, they might be overreacting because the parents are allowed to set boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author an asshole? Probably not. They're a teenager whose birthday plans are being affected by a last-minute decision. The parents might need to be more considerate, but the author isn't entirely at fault. The key points are the lack of prior communication and the author's desire for inclusion in decisions affecting their space. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because their feelings are valid, even if they can't control the outcome. The parents have the final say, but the author's perspective is understandable.\n"
