I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house, and they weren't informed in time. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is having a birthday party and wanted to invite friends. The problem arises because their dad allowed a friend's son (around 10 years old) to stay over without giving them enough notice. The author feels that they don't like surprises and wanted to know in advance, especially since their friends aren't allowed to stay the night. They also mention a past experience where their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which might contribute to their current sensitivity.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is organizing the party and probably has a specific plan. The dad made a decision without consulting the author, which is the main issue. The author isn't against the kid staying but is upset about the lack of communication and the inconsistency (friends can't stay over). \n\nI need to assess whether the author is being unreasonable. They have a valid reason to be upset about being left out of the decision-making, especially since it's their house and their event. The fact that the parents didn't inform them until last minute shows poor communication. Also, the author is trying to maintain their autonomy in planning the party. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the dad thought it was a kind gesture to include a friend's son. But the key here is the lack of communication and the author's right to control their own space and event. The author isn't being selfish; they're expressing frustration over being excluded from decisions affecting them. \n\nSo, in terms of accountability, the parents might be at fault for not involving the author in the decision. The author's upset is a reasonable reaction to being treated like a surprise. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they have a valid grievance about communication and control over their event. The fact that the parents didn't check with them first is the main issue here.\n"
