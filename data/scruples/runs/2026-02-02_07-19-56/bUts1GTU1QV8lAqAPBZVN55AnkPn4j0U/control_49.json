I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old) for a sleepover, but the author was not informed until the same day.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to have a party with their friends playing Smash Ultimate. They mention they don't like surprises and want to be informed in time. The dad agreed to the sleepover with the friend's son, and the author found out yesterday. The author is upset because they didn't know beforehand and didn't get a say, even though they asked if their friends could stay overnight, which was denied.\n\nNow, considering typical family dynamics and boundaries, parents often make decisions without consulting their children, especially if they're younger. However, the author is a teenager (since it's a birthday and they're inviting friends), so they might be expected to have some autonomy. The key points here are the lack of communication and the sudden decision. The author's frustration stems from not being involved in the decision-making process, which is a valid concern. Parents might say they're trying to be kind, but the child's feelings about their own event being disrupted matters. The fact that the parent signed them up for a camp last year without permission adds context, showing a pattern of unexpected decisions. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the abruptness and lack of choice. So, the parent might be at fault here for not checking in with the child about their plans and preferences. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
