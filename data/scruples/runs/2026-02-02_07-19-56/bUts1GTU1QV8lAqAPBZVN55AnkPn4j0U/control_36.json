I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover without consulting the author. The author wanted their friends to stay overnight and is upset about the last-minute surprise.\n\nFirst, the author's main points: they wanted to have a party, had plans for friends to stay, and the dad's friend's kid is coming as a surprise. The parent decided without giving enough notice. The author feels they should have been consulted, especially since they wanted to avoid surprises after a past experience where their mom signed them up for a camp without notice.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the lack of communication, the surprise element, and the author's feeling of being excluded from decisions that affect their own space. The parents might think they're being helpful by inviting the kid, but the author values their autonomy and planning time. The parents' actions don't consider the author's preferences, especially after a previous negative experience. The author isn't against the kid staying per se, just the way it was handled. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents made a decision affecting the author's event without prior discussion. The author has the right to express their feelings about their personal space and event planning. The parents should have talked to the author first. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they're upset because they weren't given a choice. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
