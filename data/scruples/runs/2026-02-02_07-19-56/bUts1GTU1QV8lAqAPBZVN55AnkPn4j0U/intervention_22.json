I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they wanted the party to go smoothly because last year their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them. Now, their dad invited a kid (around 10) from his friend, and the kid decided to sleep over. The parents agreed yesterday and told the author today. The author is upset because they don't like last-minute surprises and feel they have no choice. They also asked if their friends could stay over, but the mom said no.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author wants to be informed in time, not just right before. They don't mind the kid staying but are upset about the lack of input and the surprise. The parents are making decisions without consulting them, especially after a past incident. The author is frustrated because they can't have their friends stay, which seems inconsistent.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. Let me think. Is the author being unreasonable? Well, the author is a teenager, so their feelings about autonomy and control over their own event are valid. The parents should have discussed the sleepover earlier, especially since it affects the birthday party. The surprise aspect is an issue because the author didn't have time to prepare or adjust the plans. Also, the inconsistency in allowing the friend's son to stay but not the author's friends might be a point. The parents might be favoring the other kid, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad's friend is a friend, so maybe there's a family obligation. But the author is the one hosting the party in their home, so their preferences should be considered. The author is not against the sleepover itself but the lack of communication and control. So, the author's feelings are valid. The parents are at fault here for not involving the author in the decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
