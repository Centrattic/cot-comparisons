I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the kid is upset because his dad's friend's son is having a sleepover. The kid wanted a party but didn't know about the sleepover until last minute. He's upset because he feels it's a surprise and he wasn't consulted enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kid's perspective. He's planning his birthday party, which he's been looking forward to since last year. Last year, his mom signed him up for a camp without telling him, so he's not a fan of surprises. This time, his dad allowed the friend's son to stay over without giving him a heads-up. The kid wants to be told things in time and feels he doesn't have a choice here. He even asked if his friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nNow, the parent's side. The dad invited a friend's kid, which is common. The kid's parent might think it's a good idea for socializing. The decision was made yesterday, but told to the kid today. The kid might feel this is too late, but maybe the parents thought they had time to arrange it. However, the kid's feelings about autonomy and being informed are valid. The fact that his own friends were denied the chance to stay while the other kid is allowed might add to his frustration.\n\nIs the kid being unreasonable? Well, he's not against the sleepover itself but the lack of prior notice and consultation. He's expressing a right to be included in decisions affecting his space and time. Parents often make decisions for their kids, but in this case, the kid is old enough (since he's playing Smash Ultimate and inviting friends) to have some input. The parents might not have considered his preference for planning, especially given his past experience with the camp.\n\nThe key points are the timing of the information and the lack of input. The kid isn't against the guest but the manner in which it was handled. Given that he's been clear about disliking surprises, the parents should have discussed it with him earlier. The fact that his friends can't stay might also contribute to feeling it's unfair. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not. He's advocating for his preferences and feeling his autonomy is respected. The parents might be trying to be kind by inviting the kid, but they should have considered their child's feelings about planning and surprise guests. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
