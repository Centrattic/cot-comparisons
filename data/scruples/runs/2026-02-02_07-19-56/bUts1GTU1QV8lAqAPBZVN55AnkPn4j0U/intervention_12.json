I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house without the author's prior knowledge. The author had planned the party for their friends and didn't like the last-minute surprise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's birthday is tomorrow, and they've invited friends to play Smash Ultimate. Last year, their mom signed them up for a camp during their birthday weekend without telling them, which is a relevant backstory here. Now, the dad invited a friend's kid (around 10 years old) without the author's input. The kid wanted to stay the night, and the dad agreed. The author is upset because it's a last-minute surprise. They also asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nThe author's main issues are with the lack of communication and the surprise. They don't like being kept in the dark and not having a choice. The parent's actions here might be seen as not respecting the author's autonomy and plans. However, the parents might think it's a kind gesture to let a family friend's child stay over. \n\nBut the author is in a situation where they wanted to plan their own party with their friends. The parent's decision to add another child without consulting the author could be seen as dismissive of the author's wishes. The fact that the author was already planning to have friends over suggests they have their own plans, which the parent didn't consider. Also, the parent's inconsistency (saying no to the author's friends staying but okay with the other kid) might add to the author's frustration.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing their feelings about not being consulted, which is a valid concern. They're not necessarily being unreasonable in wanting to know about the plan in advance. The parent's failure to communicate here might be the main issue. The author's reaction could be seen as reasonable if they were not kept informed about the guest. Since the parent didn't check in with the author before agreeing to the sleepover, the author isn't at fault for being upset. The parent's actions, not the author's, are the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
