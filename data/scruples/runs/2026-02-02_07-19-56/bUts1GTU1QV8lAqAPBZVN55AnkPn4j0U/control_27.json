I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a sleepover at their house. The situation is that the author's birthday is tomorrow and they planned a party with friends. However, their dad's friend's 10-year-old son is coming for a sleepover, and the author feels it's a surprise without their input.\n\nFirst, the author wants to have a birthday party, which is a personal event. They were not informed about the sleepover until right before it, which is a common point of frustration. The parent didn't consult the child about the plans, even though it's their house and their birthday. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of choice and last-minute notice. \n\nThe mom previously did something similar by signing them up for a camp without telling them. The author mentions they wanted to invite their own friends to stay, but the mom said no. So the main issues here are autonomy and communication. The parents are making decisions without considering the child's preferences, especially regarding their own home and time. \n\nFrom a typical perspective, when a child is old enough to have their own plans, especially for their birthday, parents should involve them in such decisions. The fact that the sleepover was agreed upon yesterday and only mentioned today shows a lack of consideration for the child's feelings and schedule. The author is upset because they value their own plans and the ability to have a say in their environment. \n\nMost people would argue that the parents are overstepping by not discussing the guest and the sleepover with the child. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to know in advance and to have some control over their own party. The parents' actions here are the main problem, not the author's feelings of being upset. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents should have communicated better and respected the author's wishes for their birthday celebration.\n"
