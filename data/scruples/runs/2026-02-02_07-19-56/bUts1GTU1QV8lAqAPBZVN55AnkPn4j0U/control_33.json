I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author being upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which is their birthday. They wanted to have a party with friends playing Smash Ultimate, but the kid decided to stay over without them being informed in time. The parents didn't tell them until yesterday, and they're upset because they didn't get a choice and don't like surprises.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is frustrated because they wanted to plan their birthday party and didn't have control over who was coming. They also mention that last year, their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which might have contributed to their dislike of surprises. The dad's friend's son just decided he wanted to stay, and the parents approved it without consulting the author. The author then tried to get their friends to stay over, but the mom said no. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of communication and the author's feelings about being excluded from decisions affecting their own home. The parents might have thought it was okay to let the kid stay, but they didn't consider the author's feelings or their plans. The author isn't against the kid staying per se, but the way it was handled\u2014without prior discussion\u2014bothers them. \n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, it's reasonable for the author to feel upset. They were expecting a birthday party and wanted to have control over the event. The parents' decision to allow another child's sleepover without informing the host could disrupt the plans and make the host feel disrespected. The author's request for their friends to stay was denied, which adds to their frustration. \n\nHowever, the parents might argue that they were accommodating the dad's friend's son, and maybe they saw it as a kind gesture. But the main issue is the lack of communication. If the author wasn't informed in time, it's understandable they're upset. The fact that the parents didn't check in with the author about their plans for the birthday also plays a role. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't at fault here. They're expressing their feelings about a situation that was handled without their input. The parents might be at fault for not considering the author's preferences. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
