I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the A-hole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being upset about a surprise sleepover at their house on their birthday. \n\nFirst, the author's birthday party is tomorrow, and they've invited friends to play Smash Ultimate. Last year, their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which is part of their history. Now, the dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old) without consulting the author. The kid decided to stay over, and the parents agreed the day before, only telling the author that day. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and feel they should have been informed in time. They also asked if their own friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider the key points. The main issue is the lack of communication. The author's parents made a decision without consulting them, especially since the author values being informed in advance. The surprise aspect is a trigger because of the previous camp incident. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of choice and last-minute notice. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, they have a valid reason to feel this way. They wanted to avoid another surprise, and their parents didn't respect their preferences. The parents made a unilateral decision, which can be seen as dismissive of the author's feelings. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're expressing their right to be informed and to have a say in their own space, especially on their birthday. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're justified in their feelings because their parents didn't communicate properly and ignored their past experiences. The parents are the ones who might be in the wrong here for not involving their child in the decision-making process.\n"
