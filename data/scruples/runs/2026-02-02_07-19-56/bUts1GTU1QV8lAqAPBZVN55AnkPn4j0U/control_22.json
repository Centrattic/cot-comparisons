I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party. The author wanted to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate, which they really wanted after last year's disappointment where their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them. Now, their dad's friend's son, around 10 years old, is having a sleepover at their house. The parents decided this yesterday and only told the author today. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and weren't given a choice. They also mentioned they asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is upset about the last-minute surprise, not the sleepover itself. They don't like not being informed in time and not having a say. The parents made a decision without consulting them properly. The author's main issues are about lack of communication and autonomy in their own party. \n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective: maybe they thought the sleepover was a good idea, perhaps to include their dad's friend's child. But the problem is the timing and the way it was handled. The author is being respectful by not opposing the sleepover itself but is upset about the lack of notice and input. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents should have discussed this with the child earlier, especially since it's their party. The author is within their rights to feel wronged if their parents didn't involve them in the decision-making. The fact that the author is trying to be reasonable (not against the sleepover per se) but is frustrated about the process suggests they're not the one in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the issue is about the parents not communicating and respecting the author's wishes regarding their own event.\n"
