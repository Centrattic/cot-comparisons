I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday. The author had planned a party with friends to play Smash Ultimate and really wanted it after last year's camp trip mishap. The dad invited the kid, and now the kid wants to stay over, but the author finds out just a day before and feels like they didn't have a choice. They also asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is upset about the last-minute decision. They mention disliking surprises and not being informed in time. The dad and the friend's family made the decision without consulting them, even though they had a previous experience where being excluded led to disappointment. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of input and the surprise nature of it. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, the situation revolves around autonomy and consideration. The author planned something important to them, and the parents made a decision that affects the event without their input. The kid's request was agreed upon the day before and told to the author the same day, which seems rushed. The parents might have thought it was okay, but the author's feelings about prior arrangements and their right to have a say in their own party are valid. \n\nAlso, there's a double standard here. The author's own friends can't stay over, but the dad's friend's son can. That could add to the frustration. The author's previous experience where they were excluded from a decision (the camp trip) is relevant because it shows a pattern that might not be addressed. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents thought they were being kind by inviting a friend's child. But the timing is an issue. The author is responsible enough to plan a party and expect to be informed about such things. Their reaction is about being included in decisions that affect their plans, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer here is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's feelings about being informed and having a say in their own party are justified. The parents made a decision without considering their child's preferences and prior experiences, which is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable; they want to avoid the same hurt from last year. The double standard also isn't helping. Therefore, the author is not the one in the wrong.\n"
