I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about a friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday.\n\nThe author's birthday is tomorrow. They wanted a party with friends to play Smash Ultimate. Their mom didn't tell them she signed them up for a camp last year during their birthday, which was a surprise. Now, the dad invited his friend's kid (around 10 years old) and agreed to a sleepover. The author didn't know until yesterday, and they're upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to know in time. They also mentioned that when they asked if their friends could stay overnight, the mom said no. So the author feels they don't have a choice and are upset about the sudden addition.\n\nFirst, the main points are about not being informed in time and not liking surprises. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and the surprise. They're not against the sleepover itself but the way it was handled. The parent made decisions without consulting the child, especially regarding something as significant as a birthday party. The author had to coordinate their own party, maybe sent out invites or made plans, and now this unexpected guest is added, which could disrupt their plans. The mom also said no when the author asked if their friends could stay, which adds to the frustration. The parent's actions might be seen as dismissive of the author's preferences and feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents should involve their child in decisions regarding their own events, especially when it's their birthday. Surprises can be nice, but in this case, it seems like the parents didn't consider the child's autonomy. The author is within their rights to be upset about not being informed and having their plans possibly disrupted. The fact that the parents also refused the author's request to have their friends stay overnight but allowed another child to stay might indicate inconsistency, which the author is pointing out. So the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
