I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a birthday party. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow. The key points are:\n\n1. The author was planning a birthday party with friends to play Smash Ultimate.\n2. The dad invited the friend's son (around 10 years old) without informing the author beforehand.\n3. The kid decided to stay the night, and the dad agreed, but they only told the author today.\n4. The author doesn't like surprises and feels they weren't given a choice. They also asked if their friends could stay but were told no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is planning their own birthday party, which they were really looking forward to since the previous year was ruined by a surprise camp trip. The parent's action of inviting someone else without prior consent might interfere with the author's plans. \n\nThe author's main issue is the lack of communication and the sudden addition of a guest, which disrupts their planned activity. They are not opposed to the kid staying per se, but the way it was handled\u2014without notice and without allowing their friends to stay\u2014feels unfair. \n\nFrom the parent's perspective, maybe they thought it was a nice gesture to include the friend's son, especially if they have a good relationship. However, the author's autonomy in planning their own event is being undermined. The parent didn't consult the author about their plans or the guest list, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, there's inconsistency here: the author's friends aren't allowed to stay, but the friend's son is. That might make the author feel their preferences are being ignored. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are expressing frustration about their lack of control over their own event. Parents often make decisions for their children, but in this case, the author has a valid reason to be upset\u2014especially after the previous disappointment. The parent's failure to communicate and consider the author's feelings could be the real issue here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
