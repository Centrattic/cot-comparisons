I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on the author's birthday, which was planned without the author's knowledge until right before the party.\n\nFirst, the author wanted a birthday party with friends to make up for last year's issue where their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them. Now, their dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old) for a sleepover, and the author is upset because they weren't informed in time and feel they don't have a choice. They also mention that when they asked if their own friends could stay, their mom said no.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the lack of notice and the author's feeling of being excluded from the decision-making process. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the manner in which it was arranged. They wanted to have control over their party, especially after a previous disappointment. \n\nThe parent's actions might be seen as not respecting the author's wishes by not giving proper notice and not considering their preferences. However, the author also hasn't outright refused the sleepover but is upset about the lack of communication. The fact that they asked about their own friends staying and were denied might contribute to their frustration. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents might have the authority to make such decisions, but the author's feelings of being treated unfairly are valid. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable in their upset. Since the issue is about communication and autonomy, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be informed and have a say in their own party. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
