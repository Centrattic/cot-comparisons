I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is having a birthday party tomorrow where they invited some friends to play Smash Ultimate. Their dad's friend's son, around 10 years old, is being invited by the dad, and the kid decided to stay the night. The parents agreed yesterday and told the author today. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and weren't informed in time. They\u2019re not against the kid staying but are upset about not having a choice and the last-minute notice. They asked if their friends could stay the night, and the mom said no.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the a-hole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if I agree. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about not being informed in time. The author wanted to avoid surprises because they don't like them. The parents made the decision without consulting the author properly. The kid's stay wasn't discussed until now, even though the parents agreed yesterday. The author feels their autonomy is being ignored, especially since their own friends aren't allowed to stay but the other kid is. That seems unfair.\n\nBut maybe the parents have their reasons. The dad's friend might be a family friend, and letting the kid stay could be a gesture of hospitality. However, they should have considered the author's feelings. The author was planning a party, so adding someone unexpected could disrupt their plans. Not informing the author until the last minute is a problem because they wanted to manage their event properly.\n\nAlso, the author's previous experience with the mom signing them up for a camp without consent might contribute to their current feelings. They might be more sensitive about not having control over their own plans. The fact that they asked if their friends could stay and got a no, while another kid can, adds to the sense of unfairness.\n\nIs the author unreasonable for being upset? They have a valid reason to be frustrated. The parents didn't consider their input in a timely manner. The author isn't against the kid staying but is against the lack of communication and control. They\u2019re in a position where they can't say no, which might make them feel disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents thought they were being considerate by allowing the friend's son to stay, not realizing how it would affect the author's party. But even so, the author's feelings are valid. The key here is that the parents didn't check with the author early enough. If they had told the author earlier, there might have been a way to adjust plans. The sudden change at the last minute is the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate grievance about lack of communication and being treated unfairly compared to their own friends. The parents should have discussed this with the author in a timely manner. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
