I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about a birthday party where the dad's friend's son is having a sleepover without the kid being informed in time.\n\nFirst, the kid is upset because there was a surprise. The parent didn't inform them about the sleepover until right before it. The kid wanted to have their friends stay over, but the mom said no. The main issue is the lack of communication and the sudden change in plans.\n\nThe parent's responsibility here is to involve the child in planning their own birthday party, especially since the child was previously upset about a camp trip overriding their birthday. The fact that the parent agreed to the sleepover without discussing it with the child is a problem. The child isn't against the sleepover itself but the way it was handled. The parent's decision to say no to the child's friends staying over but allow another kid might add to the feeling of unfairness.\n\nThe kid's perspective is valid because they want to feel included and have their preferences considered. The parent's failure to communicate and involve the child in the decision-making process is where the issue lies. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate grievance about not being informed and having their input ignored.\n"
