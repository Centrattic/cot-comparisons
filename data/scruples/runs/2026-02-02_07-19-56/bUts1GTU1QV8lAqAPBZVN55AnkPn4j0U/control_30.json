I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party being planned, and a surprise sleepover by a cousin or friend of the dad. The author is upset because they weren't informed in advance and feel like their preferences aren't respected.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user wanted a birthday party with friends, specifically to play Smash Ultimate. They mention that last year their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which probably made them dislike surprises. Now, the dad invited a friend's son, who decided to stay over, and the parents only told the user the day before. The user is okay with the sleepover itself but is upset about the lack of prior notice and not being consulted about their own friends staying over.\n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication and considering the user's preferences. The user is a teenager organizing their own event, so having a last-minute addition from the parents without input might be frustrating. The parents might have thought it was a good idea to include a family friend's child, but not discussing it with the birthday child, especially given the past experience with the camp, seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe user isn't against the guest staying per se, but the way it was handled\u2014without prior notice and not allowing their own friends to stay\u2014seems unfair. They wanted to have control over their party guests, which is reasonable. The parents might not see it as a big deal, but the user's feelings are valid because they value being informed and having a say in their own event. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate grievance about being kept in the dark and not having their preferences respected. The parents should have discussed the guest and the sleepover with them beforehand, especially given the past incident. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
