I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a birthday party. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house, which was a surprise arranged by the parents. The author wanted to have a party with friends and didn't like the surprise because they weren't consulted in time.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they really wanted the party to happen. Last year, their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which probably made them not trust the parents' decisions. Now, this year, the dad invited this kid without asking the author first. The kid then decided to stay overnight, and the parents agreed the day before, telling the author the same day. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and want to be informed in time. They also asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no. So the author feels that they're being treated unfairly\u2014why can the other kid stay but their friends can't?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're being taken out of the loop. They wanted to plan their party, maybe invite friends to stay, but the parents made a decision that affects the author's event. The key points here are the lack of consultation and the inconsistency in allowing the other kid to stay while denying the author's friends. The author isn't against the kid staying, just the way it was done without their input. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might see it as their right to invite their friends' child, especially if they're family friends. They might also think the author is overreacting about the sleepover since it's a family friend's kid. But the issue is that the author's plans are being changed without their knowledge, which affects their special day. \n\nConsidering the details, the author is within their rights to feel upset. They had a specific plan for their birthday and the last-minute addition of a sleepover that wasn't discussed with them disrupts that. The parents should have involved the author in the decision-making process, especially since it's the author's house and their party. The inconsistency in allowing the other kid but not the author's friends adds to the unfairness the author feels. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason to be upset about the lack of communication and the unfair treatment.\n"
