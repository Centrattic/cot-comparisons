I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a friend of their dad's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday. The author wanted a party with friends, and their parents decided to let this kid stay overnight without giving them enough notice.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is not the sleepover itself but the lack of prior notice and inclusion in the decision. They mention they don't like surprises and wanted to be told in time. The parents arranged it yesterday and told them today. So the problem is the timing and lack of consultation.\n\nThe author also points out that they asked if their friends could stay, and the mom said no. This inconsistency might be a point. The kid gets to stay, but their friends can't, which feels unfair. The author is upset because they don't get a choice in the matter, which is a valid feeling.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing frustration about being excluded from decisions affecting their own event. It's their birthday party, so expecting some control over the guest list and activities makes sense. The parents didn't consult them, leading to a conflict. The author's reaction is about autonomy and fairness, not the sleepover itself. So probably, they aren't the a-hole. The answer is B.\n"
