I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover without telling the kid in time, and the kid is upset about the surprise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The kid wanted a party with friends, but the dad added a guest (the friend's son) who decided to stay overnight. The kid mentions that they don't like surprises and that they weren't informed until right before the party. Also, they asked if their friends could stay, and the mom said no. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the lack of communication and involvement in the decision. The kid is planning their own party, which is a significant event (birthday), and a parent is making a decision that affects their plans without prior discussion. The kid isn't against the sleepover itself but the fact that they weren't given a say or enough notice. \n\nFrom a general perspective, when a child is old enough to plan and host their own party, parents might expect to involve them in such decisions, especially if it's a social event they're looking forward to. The fact that the dad's friend's son just decided to stay over without the child's input could be seen as undermining their autonomy. \n\nThe parent's actions here might be considered inconsiderate if they didn't check with the child first. The child's friends being excluded from staying over while the cousin (or friend's son) is allowed might also contribute to the feeling of unfairness. The kid's right to have a say in their own party is valid. \n\nHowever, parents might argue that they have the authority to make decisions for their child's safety and well-being. But in this case, the main issue is the sudden change and lack of consultation. The kid's frustration is about not having control over their event, which is a reasonable concern. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the issue is about the parents making a last-minute decision without considering the child's preferences and feelings, especially when the child was actively planning their own party and even asked about friends staying over. The parents should have discussed this earlier with the child to avoid the conflict.\n"
