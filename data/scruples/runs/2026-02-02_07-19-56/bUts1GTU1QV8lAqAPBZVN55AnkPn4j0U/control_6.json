I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for being upset about a friend of their dad's son having a sleepover at their house during their birthday party. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The person is having a birthday party for their friends tomorrow, specifically to play Smash Ultimate. Last year, their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which probably made them not want surprises this time. Now, their dad's friend's son (around 10 years old) is coming for a sleepover, but they weren't told until today. The person is upset because they don't like surprises and feel they should have been told earlier. They also mention they asked if their friends could stay over, but their mom said no.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the lack of communication and the surprise. The person wants to be informed in a timely manner and feels they had no choice in the matter. The dad and mom made the decision without consulting them, which is a problem because they're the ones hosting the party. The person isn't against the sleepover itself, just the way it was handled. \n\nThey also mention being upset about their friends not being able to stay over, which shows they value their party and the plans they've made. Since they're the one whose house it is and whose birthday it is, it's reasonable for them to want input on who is coming and how the event is structured. The parents didn't consider their feelings or preferences here, which is a breach of their autonomy, especially for a teenager. \n\nConsidering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be upset about the lack of communication and being excluded from decisions about their own party. The parents and the other kid's actions were the issue here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
