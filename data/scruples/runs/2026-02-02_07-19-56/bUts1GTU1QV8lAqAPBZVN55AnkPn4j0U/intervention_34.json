I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover, and the author didn't get a say in the matter. The author wanted their invited friends to stay over, but the mom said no.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about the author's feelings regarding being informed last minute. They don't like surprises and feel like they should have been told earlier. Also, the fact that the dad's friend's kid decided to stay over without the author's input is a problem. The author is upset because they feel they have no choice in the situation.\n\nNow, considering the author's age isn't specified, but the context mentions their dad's friend's son is around 10, so maybe the author is a teenager. If they're a teenager, having some autonomy in their own home for their birthday party might be reasonable. The parents might be prioritizing the friend's son, perhaps because of their relationship with the dad, but not allowing the author's friends to stay over could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of notice and the inability to make their own decisions. The mother's refusal for the author's friends to stay might contribute to the author's frustration. The parents might not be considering the author's feelings about their own event. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents might be at fault for not consulting their child about the guest list and the arrangements for their birthday. The author is expressing their right to be informed in a timely manner and to have a say in their own party. However, the parents might argue they're trying to accommodate their friend's son. \n\nBut the main issue is the author's perspective. They didn't like the surprise and wanted more control. Since the parents are the ones making the decisions, the author's reaction is about their autonomy. It's possible the parents aren't in the wrong if they're acting in good faith, but the author's feelings are valid. However, the author might be overreacting if the parents are trying to balance multiple considerations. \n\nBut in the AITA context, being upset about not being informed about a guest at your own party, especially when your own guests are restricted, might be seen as not being in the wrong. The parents' decisions could be the issue here. The author is asserting their right to control their own event, which is reasonable. So the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
