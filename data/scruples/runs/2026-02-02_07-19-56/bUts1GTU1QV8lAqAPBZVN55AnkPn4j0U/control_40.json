I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the kid is upset because his dad's friend's son is having a sleepover, but the parents didn't inform him until last minute. The kid wanted to invite his friends to stay over, but the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The main issue is about being upset due to lack of communication and unexpected changes. The kid wanted to avoid surprises after a bad experience with the camp trip. The parents allowed the cousin to stay overnight without consulting him, which he finds unfair, especially since he was denied the same for his friends.\n\nIs the kid in the wrong for being upset? Well, the parents did agree to the sleepover without telling him. He has a valid reason to be upset because he didn't have a say, and the inconsistency in rules (his friends can't stay, but the cousin can) might be frustrating. The parents' actions here might be seen as dismissive of his feelings, especially since they knew his dislike for surprises. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents thought it was a small thing or didn't realize how it would affect him. But the kid's feelings are about not being respected in his own space and not having a choice. Since the parents didn't communicate early enough, that's a problem. The kid isn't being unreasonable for wanting to plan his party without last-minute changes. So probably, the answer is B (not in the wrong). They should consider his perspective and the inconsistency in the rules.\n"
