I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a sleepover at their house. The situation is that the author's dad invited a friend's son (around 10) for a sleepover the day before the author's birthday party with friends. The author didn't like being told last minute and feels like they don't have a choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's birthday is tomorrow, and they were planning to have a party. The parent didn't inform them about the sleepover until the day before, which is a surprise. The author doesn't like surprises and wanted more time to prepare or perhaps feel it's their choice to have the guest. Also, the author asked if their friends could stay, and the mom said no. \n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication and the timing of the information. The parent might have thought it's a good idea to have another child stay, but not discussing it with the birthday child in a timely manner could be problematic. The author's feelings about autonomy and control over their own event are valid. Being upset because of a sudden change, especially when they wanted to have their friends stay as well but that's not allowed, might show that they feel their preferences aren't being respected.\n\nBut I should also think about the parent's perspective. Maybe they thought it's a small matter or wanted to accommodate the friend's kid. However, the author's birthday is a significant event for them. The parent's actions might have overshadowed the author's plans, even if the intention was good. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings about the surprise and the lack of input. They have a right to be upset if their preferences are being overlooked, especially in their own home. The parents should have considered the author's plans and discussed it with them in advance. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
