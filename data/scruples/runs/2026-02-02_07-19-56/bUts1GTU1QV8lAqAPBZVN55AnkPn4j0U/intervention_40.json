I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for being upset about a friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday.\n\nSo the setup is that the person's birthday is tomorrow, and they had a party planned with friends to play Smash Ultimate. The problem is that their dad invited a friend's son, who is around 10 years old, without discussing it with them. The parents decided on the sleepover yesterday and told the kid today. The person is upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to be informed in time. They also mention that they asked if their friends could stay overnight, but their mom said no.\n\nThe person is wondering if they're the a-hole here. The user initially thought they might be in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is lack of communication. The kid didn't like the surprise because they had their own plans and wanted input. The parents didn't consult them about the guest. Also, there's inconsistency in the parents' response\u2014why the friend's son can stay but their own friends can't? That might be a point of frustration for the kid.\n\nIs the kid being unreasonable for not wanting a surprise guest? Well, they have the right to their personal space and plans. Disliking surprises, especially when it affects their event, is valid. The parents should have discussed this with them beforehand. Also, the kid's request for their friends to stay was denied, which shows a double standard.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the kid is being selfish by not wanting the guest. But given the context of the previous camp trip incident, they might have a history of not being considered in family decisions. So their sensitivity to being blindsided makes sense.\n\nThe parents' actions are the main issue here. They made a decision without considering the child's input, which led to the upset. The kid's reaction is about respecting their choices and feeling disrespected. So the kid isn't the a-hole; the parents are. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
