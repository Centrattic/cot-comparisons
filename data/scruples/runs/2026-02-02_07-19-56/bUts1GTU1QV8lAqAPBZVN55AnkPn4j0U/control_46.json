I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday party day.\n\nFirst, the author's birthday is tomorrow, and they planned a party. Their dad allowed a friend's kid to stay over without informing them in time. The author doesn't like surprises and feels they should have been told earlier. Also, they wanted their own friends to stay over, but mom said no.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't know about the sleepover until yesterday, and it's happening the next day. They feel it's a surprise, which they don't like. The dad and mom made the decision without considering the author's preferences, especially since the author had already planned their own party. The fact that the author asked if their friends could stay and was denied shows that their input wasn't considered. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, having their own space and plans disrupted without being consulted can be frustrating. The parents might be trying to do something nice, but the way it was handled\u2014without communication and ignoring the child's wishes\u2014could be seen as dismissive. The author is not being unreasonable here; they have valid feelings about their own party and autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their feelings are justified given the lack of communication and consideration for their plans.\n"
