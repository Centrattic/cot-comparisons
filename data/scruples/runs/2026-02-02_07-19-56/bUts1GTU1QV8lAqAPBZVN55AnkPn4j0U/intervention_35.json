I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, which is also when they're having a party. The author wanted to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate, but the dad's friend's son decided to stay the night without consulting them first. The author feels it's a surprise and they didn't get enough notice, and they also mentioned their mom said no when they asked if their friends could stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is turning 13 (assuming from the context of last year's camp trip), and they're having a birthday party. They wanted to invite their friends, but their dad allowed a friend's son to stay over without giving them proper notice. The author feels that they should have been consulted earlier and that it's unfair since their own friends aren't allowed to stay the night. \n\nThe author's main grievances are about lack of communication and feeling that their preferences weren't considered. They mention disliking surprises and not having a choice. However, the dad made the decision after agreeing with the friend's parent. The mom also declined the author's request for their friends to stay. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing frustration about a situation where their autonomy is being disregarded. Parents have the authority to make decisions about their home, but children also have a right to have their feelings considered. The author's feelings of not being informed in a timely manner and the inconsistency in the rules (their friends can't stay, but the dad's friend's son can) might contribute to the conflict.\n\nIn the AITA context, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The author hasn't done anything wrong themselves; they're reacting to the parents' decisions. The parents might be at fault for not considering the child's feelings and preferences. The author's desire to have their own friends stay and the surprise of the other kid staying could be seen as a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after considering the details, it's more likely that the parents are not communicating properly. The author isn't being unreasonable for wanting to know in advance and to have their wishes considered. The parents might be the ones at fault here for not checking with the author first. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The key point is about the parents not involving the child in the decision-making process and inconsistent rules, which the author is justified in being upset about.\n"
