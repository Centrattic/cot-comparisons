I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house, and they weren't told in advance. The author wanted their friends to stay over too but was denied.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset because they didn't have prior notice about the sleepover. They mention disliking surprises and wanting to know things in time. The dad allowed the kid to stay after the friend decided on his own, and they only found out the same day. The author also tried to invite their friends to stay but was refused.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The main issue is the lack of communication. The parents might have made the decision without consulting the child, which is a common issue in parent-child relationships. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the sudden arrangement and lack of choice. They wanted their friends to stay as well, which the parents denied, possibly leading to favoritism or inconsistency.\n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might be trying to be kind to a friend's child, but they didn't consider the child's feelings or plans. The author's reaction is about wanting autonomy and being involved in decisions that affect their space and social time. The fact that the author tried to invite their friends but was denied shows a desire for fairness, which wasn't met.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents might be in the wrong for not discussing this with their child beforehand, especially since the child is old enough to be planning a party. The author isn't the one initiating the sleepover; it's the friend's son. However, the author is expressing valid concerns about autonomy and being informed in a timely manner. The response from the parents could be seen as dismissive of the child's feelings.\n\nI think the key here is whether the parents should have involved the child in the decision. If the child is old enough to host a party, they should have a say in who comes over for a sleepover. The author isn't being unreasonable for wanting to know in advance and for their friends to have the same opportunity. So, the parents might be at fault here, making the author not the asshole. But I need to check if there's any part where the author is being unreasonable. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of communication and being overruled when trying to extend the same to their friends. That seems fair. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
