I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party being disrupted by an unexpected sleepover from the dad's friend's son.\n\nFirst, the author planned a birthday party and invited friends. The parent (dad or mom) invited a kid from the dad's friend, and now that kid is coming for a sleepover without the author's knowledge until last minute. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to know in advance. They also mention that they asked if their friends could stay over, but the mom said no.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author wanted to plan their birthday without last-minute additions, the parent made arrangements without consulting the author, and the author is unhappy about the lack of input. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the parents overstepped by not informing the author in time. The author's desire to have control over their own party and be informed about guests is reasonable. On the other hand, parents might think they're being kind by including a friend's child, maybe to make the birthday more fun or to accommodate the friend's family. However, not consulting the child about such a significant change could be a problem, especially if the child has specific plans.\n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of prior notice and input. The parents might have acted without considering the child's feelings or plans. The fact that the author's own friends weren't allowed to stay over while this kid was, adds to the sense of unfairness. The author's frustration is about being excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nIn many cases, kids (especially older ones) should have a say in their own parties. The parents might not have considered that their child might feel the guest list is their responsibility. The kid from the friend might be a surprise, but the parents should have discussed it with the child beforehand. \n\nSo, the author's anger seems justified because they were left out of the loop and the decision affected their plans. The parents might be the ones in the wrong here for not consulting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
