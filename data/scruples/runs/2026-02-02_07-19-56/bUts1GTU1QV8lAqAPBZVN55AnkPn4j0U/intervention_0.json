I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the kid wanted to have their friends over to play Smash Ultimate. But their dad's friend's son is coming for a sleepover, and the kid is upset about it. The main points are that the kid didn't want surprises, especially since last year their mom did a similar thing with a camp trip. Now the parents told them about the sleepover the same day, and the kid is upset they didn't get to know in time. They also mentioned that when they asked if their friends could stay the night, the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kid's perspective. They wanted to plan their birthday party and have their friends stay over. The sudden addition of a guest they didn't know about might feel like a disruption. They're not against the guest staying but are upset about the lack of prior notice and not having a choice. The parents might have thought it's okay to have a guest, but the kid feels it's their home and they should have input. The previous incident with the camp trip might make them more sensitive to last-minute surprises.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that the kid's friends aren't staying, but only one other kid. The dad's friend is a guest of the dad, so maybe the parents felt it was their decision to have the friend's son stay. The kid's request for their friends to stay was denied, which could be a point of frustration, but that's a different issue.\n\nIs the kid being unreasonable? They have a valid point about not liking surprises and wanting to know in advance, especially after the previous experience. However, the parents might not have considered how the kid would feel about it. The kid is within their right to express their feelings and want to be included in such decisions, especially regarding their own space (the house) on their birthday. The parents might be at fault here for not consulting the kid, especially if the kid had already planned the party and invited friends.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think the parents might be more at fault for not involving the kid in the decision, but the kid is also reacting to a situation they find unfair. However, the question is whether the author (the kid) is in the wrong. The kid isn't being malicious; they're upset about the lack of notice and control over their own space. Their feelings are valid. The parents made the decision without considering the kid's preferences. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
