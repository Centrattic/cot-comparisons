I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party being ruined by a surprise sleepover from the dad's friend's son. The author is upset because they weren't given enough notice and didn't have a choice in the matter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a birthday party with friends to play Smash Ultimate. They really wanted this party because last year their mom signed them up for a camp trip on their birthday without telling them. This time, their dad invited a friend's kid (around 10 years old) without consulting them. The kid then decided to stay the night, and the parents agreed to it only the day before, which upset the author. They're not against the sleepover itself but the lack of prior communication and the sudden change. They even tried to invite their friends to stay over, but the mom said no.\n\nNow, the main issue here is about autonomy and control over the event. The author had planned their party, and the unexpected addition of another guest could disrupt their plans. The parents made the decision without considering the author's feelings or plans. The author's frustration seems valid because they were not consulted, and the last-minute notice doesn't allow them to adjust the plans. The fact that they tried to get their friends to stay over but were denied adds to the unfairness they're feeling.\n\nThe parent's actions might be seen as overstepping. While they might have thought it's a nice gesture to include the friend's son, they didn't respect the author's autonomy in planning their own event. The author's desire for transparency and prior communication is reasonable. Surprises can be nice, but without notice, they can be stressful, especially when it's a significant plan like a birthday party.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be upset about the lack of communication and the sudden change to their plans. The parents should have involved them in the decision-making process. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
