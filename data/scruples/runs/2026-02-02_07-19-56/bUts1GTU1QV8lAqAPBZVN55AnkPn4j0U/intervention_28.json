I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, which they had planned a party for. The author is upset because they weren't informed in time and don't like surprises, especially since their mom had done something similar before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wanted a birthday party with friends, invited some for Smash Ultimate. Their dad invited a friend's kid, and the kid decided to stay overnight. The parents didn't inform the author until yesterday or today, and they didn't allow the author's friends to stay overnight. The author is upset about the lack of notice and not having a choice.\n\nThe author's main issue is not the kid staying over but the lack of communication and being given a choice. They mention disliking surprises and being told things last minute. The mom had previously signed them up for a camp without telling them, which adds to their frustration.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate grievance about not being informed and having choices made for them. However, they might be overreacting because the dad is bringing a friend's child over, which is a common family gesture. The parents might not have considered the impact on the author's plans. The author's request for their friends to stay was denied, which adds to their resentment. \n\nBut does that make the author the asshole? They're justified in being upset about not being included in the decision. However, refusing to allow the friend's son to stay while allowing the author's friends to come might seem inconsistent. However, the key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the author's feelings. The author isn't the only one at fault here; the parents also made a decision without consulting them. \n\nSo, in the AITA context, typically if someone's parents make decisions without them, especially affecting their plans, they're not the asshole. The author's frustration is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
