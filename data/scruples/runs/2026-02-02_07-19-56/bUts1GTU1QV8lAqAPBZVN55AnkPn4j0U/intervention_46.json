I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset about a friend of their dad's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, when they had planned a Smash Ultimate party with friends.\n\nThe author mentions that they wanted the party after last year's disappointment when their mom signed them up for a camp trip without telling them. Now, their dad allowed the friend's son to stay over, which wasn't discussed with the author until yesterday and today. The author is upset because they didn't have a choice in the matter, even though they asked if their friends could stay over and were told no. They also express that they don't like surprises and want things to be communicated in a timely manner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about autonomy and communication. The author wanted to plan their birthday party and had specific expectations. The dad made a decision without consulting the author, which is a problem because it undermines their autonomy. The friend's son decided to stay over, and the parents agreed without informing the author in time. \n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but is upset about the lack of communication and the fact that they didn't have a say. The mom previously made a decision without the author's input (the camp trip), which adds to the frustration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we look at the situation, the parents are making decisions that affect the author's personal life and event without their input. The author is expressing a valid concern about wanting to have control over their own space and events, especially on their birthday. The parents' actions seem to be the main issue here, not the author. \n\nThe author is reacting to being excluded from decisions that impact their own plans. They're not being unreasonable by wanting to be informed in a timely manner. The fact that the mom previously did something without the author's consent (camp trip) might contribute to the author's current reaction. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They are expressing a legitimate grievance about their autonomy and the lack of communication. The parents are the ones who should have involved the author in the decision-making process. So the answer should be B.\n"
