I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is having a birthday party tomorrow with some friends. They wanted to have a party with friends playing Smash Ultimate. Then their dad's friend's son, who's 10 years old, is going to have a sleepover at their house, but the author wasn't told about this until right before the party. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to know in advance, especially since they asked if their friends could stay over, and their mom said no.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that last year their mom signed them up for a camp trip during their birthday weekend without telling them. That's probably why they're so upset about not knowing about the sleepover. They don't like surprises and want to be informed in a timely manner. The dad and the friend agreed to the sleepover just yesterday and told the author today, which the author finds too late. The author isn't against the kid staying but is annoyed that they weren't consulted properly and that their own friends can't stay while this kid can.\n\nSo, the main issue is about communication and autonomy. The author feels their wishes and preferences aren't being respected. They wanted their friends to stay over, but their mom said no, which might be because the kid is a family friend's child, and maybe there's a different dynamic there. The author is frustrated because they have to host this party but don't have control over the guest list or the rules. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing their feelings about not being included in the decision-making process. They didn't invite the kid, and it's happening without their input. Their mom and dad are making decisions that affect the author's event. The author is just asserting their right to know about such changes and to have some say in their own party. The kid's presence isn't the issue; it's the lack of communication and the double standard (their friends can't stay, but this kid can). \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents might have made arrangements without considering the author's needs. The author is upset because they wanted to be informed and to have control over their own party. So, it seems like the parents might be at fault here for not consulting the author properly. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to be informed and to have their preferences considered. Therefore, the answer is probably B, not the author. They're justified in their feelings given the past incident and the current situation.\n"
