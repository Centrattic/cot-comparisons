I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because they wanted to have their own party with friends and didn't have a choice in the matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wanted to celebrate their birthday with friends, and their parents made a last-minute decision to invite someone else's child. The main issue seems to be the lack of communication and the sudden change. The author mentions not liking surprises and not being informed until the last minute. They also note that they asked if their friends could stay over, but the parents said no, which adds to the frustration.\n\nNow, thinking about parental authority versus the child's wishes. Parents usually have the final say in their household, but that doesn't mean the child's feelings aren't valid. The author is upset because their plans were affected without their input. The parents might have their reasons, like the friend's son wanting to stay, but the way it was handled could be problematic. The author didn't have a choice, and their input was ignored.\n\nAlso, the fact that the parents didn't inform the author until just before the event suggests poor communication. If the author had been told earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their plans or discussed it. The parents' decision to have the sleepover might be reasonable, but the lack of consultation with the child is a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel they're being hospitable to a friend's child. However, the child's birthday is a special occasion, and the parents should have considered the child's preferences more. The author's frustration is about autonomy and being treated like a child with no say in their own party.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents might not be \"in the wrong\" from a strict authority standpoint, but the author's feelings are valid. The author is not the asshole here because they're expressing a legitimate grievance about their lack of agency. The parents could have handled it better by discussing it with their child beforehand.\n"
